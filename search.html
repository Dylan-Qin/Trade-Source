        "content": "Data processing methods and steps: the distribution data of Rhododendron species analyzed in this study included over 70,000 records, covering China and adjacent countries. These data were obtained from online databases, including the Chinese Virtual Herbarium (CVH, http://www.cvh.ac.cn), the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, http://www.gbif.org), Biodiversity of the Hengduan Mountains (BHM, http://hengduan.huh.harvard.edu/fieldnotes/), the herbarium of the Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences (KUN, http://groups.kib.cas.cn/kun/), as well as from field surveys conducted by several research groups and collection teams of Germplasm Bank of Wild Species (GBOWS) over the past two decades. We used Flora of China (FOC, http://www.iplant.cn/foc) and Plants of the World Online (POWO, https://powo.science.kew.org) for species name standardization and correction. To ensure data validity and accuracy, incomplete geographic information, duplicates, cultivated plants, and specimen records from urban botanical gardens, parks, and museums were removed. Specimens with odd distribution points and conflicting identifications (e.g., identical collector and collection number but different species names) were re-identified. Only one record per grid cell was retained for each species to avoid uneven sampling. Species occurring in more than six distinct grid cells (5 × 5 km) were selected.Ultimately, a total of 10,306 occurrence records for 314 Rhododendron species (including 17 subspecies) were retained. Data description: the first column was the species name, the second column was the longitude, and the third column was the latitude (The longitude and latitude projection coordinate system is EPSG: 32648).数据处理方法与步骤：本研究分析的杜鹃花属物种分布数据包含7万余条记录，覆盖中国及邻近国家。数据来源于在线数据库，包括中国数字植物标本馆（CVH, http://www.cvh.ac.cn）、全球生物多样性信息网络（GBIF, http://www.gbif.org）、横断山生物多样性数据库（BHM, http://hengduan.huh.harvard.edu/fieldnotes/）、中国科学院昆明植物研究所标本馆（KUN, http://groups.kib.cas.cn/kun/），以及中国西南野生生物种质资源库（GBOWS）多个研究团队和采集组过去二十年的野外调查数据。物种名称标准化与校正参考《中国植物志》（FOC, http://www.iplant.cn/foc）和世界在线植物志（POWO, https://powo.science.kew.org）。为确保数据有效性和准确性，剔除了地理信息不完整、重复记录、栽培个体以及来自城市植物园、公园和博物馆的标本记录。对分布点异常或鉴定冲突的标本（如采集人和采集号相同但物种名不同）进行重新鉴定。每个物种在每个网格单元仅保留一条记录以避免采样不均，筛选出在6个以上独立网格单元（5×5公里）出现的物种。最终保留314种杜鹃花（含17亚种）共计10,306条分布记录。数据描述：第一列为物种名，第二列为经度，第三列为纬度（经纬度投影坐标系为EPSG:32648）。资源链接: Distribution data of Rhododendron species in China",

        "content": "In the complex landscape of credit risk management, accurately estimating Loss Given Default (LGD) is fundamental to assessing potential losses in lending portfolios. However, the absence of sufficient historical recovery data poses a significant challenge, especially for institutions operating under the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approach or in markets with low-default portfolios. This paper addresses the critical need for a practical, adaptable framework to estimate recovery rates when empirical data is sparse. The proposed framework combines multiple estimation techniques, sectoral benchmarking, expert judgment, collateral and macroeconomic adjustments, and Bayesian inference to derive credible recovery rate approximations. Building upon theoretical constructs such as the adjusted Mertonian structural model, and informed by recent research (e.g., Hlawatsch, Seidler et al.), this approach ensures that institutions can navigate LGD estimation even under strict data constraints. The methodology is illustrated through a case study on SME lending in frontier markets, demonstrating how institutions can produce conservative, transparent, and regulatorily compliant estimates. The framework aligns with Basel II and III principles, particularly around capital adequacy and model validation, and supports sound risk-adjusted pricing and strategic decision-making. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on credit risk modeling by offering actionable tools for real-world application in data-limited environments..在信用风险管理的复杂格局中，准确估计违约损失率（LGD）是评估贷款组合潜在损失的基础。然而，历史回收数据不足构成了重大挑战，特别是对于采用内部评级法（IRB）的机构或低违约组合市场中的机构。本文针对实证数据稀缺时估算回收率的实际需求，提出一个灵活实用的框架。该框架融合多种估算技术、行业基准、专家判断、抵押品与宏观经济调整以及贝叶斯推断，以得出可信的回收率近似值。基于修正后的默顿结构模型等理论构建，并借鉴近期研究（如Hlawatsch、Seidler等学者成果），该方法确保机构能在严格数据限制下完成LGD估算。通过前沿市场中小企业贷款的案例研究，本方法论展示了机构如何生成保守、透明且符合监管要求的估算结果。该框架符合巴塞尔协议II和III原则，特别是在资本充足率和模型验证方面，支持稳健的风险调整定价与战略决策。本研究通过提供适用于数据有限环境的实操工具，为信用风险建模领域的持续讨论作出贡献。资源链接: Estimating Recovery Rates in the Absence of Sufficient Data for LGD Computation: A Practical Framework",

        "content": "The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and the forced acquisition of Credit Suisse in 2023-2024 have reignited global concerns about the resilience of liquidity risk management in modern banking. These events exposed significant vulnerabilities in how liquidity stress is modeled, especially under rapid withdrawal scenarios amplified by digital banking and social media dynamics. This paper analyzes the sequence of events leading to these failures, evaluates the adequacy of current liquidity risk metrics, particularly the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) that highlights their limitations in capturing the speed and scale of stress outflows. Through a comparative case study and regulatory review, the research argues for recalibrating existing liquidity frameworks to incorporate behavioral triggers, nonlinear outflow patterns, and the systemic impact of depositor concentration. The findings advocate for a more dynamic and forward-looking approach to liquidity risk, combining traditional metrics with real-time analytics and digital risk indicators to enhance early warning capabilities and systemic resilience.硅谷银行（SVB）的倒闭与2023-2024年间瑞士信贷被强制收购事件，再度引发全球对现代银行业流动性风险管理韧性的担忧。这些危机暴露出流动性压力建模存在重大缺陷——尤其在数字银行与社交媒体效应放大的快速挤兑情景下。本文通过剖析危机演变链条，评估现行流动性风险指标（着重分析流动性覆盖率LCR与净稳定资金比率NSFR）的适用性，揭示其难以捕捉资金外流速度与规模极限的弊端。基于案例比较与监管审视，研究主张重构现有流动性框架，纳入行为触发机制、非线性外流模式及存款集中度的系统性影响。结论指出应融合传统指标与实时分析、数字风险信号，构建更具动态性与前瞻性的流动性风险管理体系，以强化预警能力与系统抗压韧性。资源链接: LiquidityRiskunder Stress: Lessons from Recent Bank Failures",

Traditional credit scoring models, often based on linear regression and static rules, are increasingly being supplanted by sophisticated AI algorithms capable of analyzing vast and complex datasets to predict default risk with greater accuracy. The study examines current applications of AI in assessing borrower creditworthiness, including natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques, highlighting how these tools enhance predictive performance and operational efficiency. However, the adoption of black-box models introduces significant ethical and regulatory challenges, particularly in terms of transparency, fairness, and accountability. This paper also addresses model risk management practices, emphasizing the need for explainable AI and robust governance frameworks to mitigate bias and ensure compliance. Through a balanced analysis of technological innovation and its implications, this research contributes to the discourse on responsible AI adoption in financial services.本文探讨了人工智能（AI）与机器学习（ML）在银行业信用风险评估中的变革性作用。传统信用评分模型通常基于线性回归和静态规则，而如今正逐渐被能够分析海量复杂数据、更精准预测违约风险的先进AI算法所取代。研究分析了AI在评估借款人信用度方面的当前应用，包括自然语言处理（NLP）和深度学习技术，重点阐释了这些工具如何提升预测性能与运营效率。然而，”黑箱”模型的采用也带来了显著的伦理与监管挑战，尤其在透明度、公平性和问责制方面。本文还探讨了模型风险管理实践，强调需要可解释AI和强健的治理框架以降低偏见并确保合规。通过对技术创新及其影响的平衡分析，本研究为金融服务领域负责任地采用AI的讨论提供了见解。资源链接: AI and Machine Learning in CreditRiskAssessment",

        "content": "Efficient software development practices today pose substantial challenges when defending program code from possible threats. The increase in application complexity outpaces traditional vulnerability detection methods, thus putting security breaches and financial losses within more likely reach. Sophisticated algorithms of Generative AI (Gen AI) help developers identify bugs in their source code while solving these programming issues. The security functions of Gen AI-based automation help developers launch protective measures for their applications ahead of development completion to decrease security risks. Gen AI algorithms process large code libraries to find repeated patterns that indicate dangerous code entries. Gen AI models train through analysis of large datasets that combine secure and insecure code, so they develop a skill for spotting buffer overflows and SQL injection points. Because of this capability, the new code review operations benefit from enhanced vulnerability detection speed and higher accuracy. Gen AI offers developers tools to create remedy suggestions demonstrating safe coding skills suitable for current agile development conditions. The industry demands secure software development, so combining Gen AI with vulnerability detection and risk analysis will establish standard operations within upcoming periods. Research efforts should focus on investing in AI model development to make them ready for use across multiple programming languages and frameworks. Real-time Gen AI integration within development platforms enables developers to monitor security issues, thus receiving prompt feedback, encouraging them to create applications focused on security standards. Developers develop applications resistant to security threats in a secure data environment through Gen AI implementation.当今高效的软件开发实践在保护程序代码免受潜在威胁方面提出了重大挑战。应用程序复杂度的增长超越了传统漏洞检测方法的能力范围，使得安全漏洞和财务损失更易发生。生成式人工智能（Gen AI）的先进算法能帮助开发者在解决编程问题的同时识别源代码中的缺陷。基于Gen AI的自动化安全功能使开发者能在开发完成前为应用程序启动防护措施，从而降低安全风险。Gen AI算法通过处理大型代码库来发现指示危险代码的重复模式。Gen AI模型通过分析包含安全与不安全代码的大规模数据集进行训练，从而培养出识别缓冲区溢出和SQL注入点的能力。得益于这种能力，新型代码审查工作获得了漏洞检测速度与准确性的双重提升。Gen AI为开发者提供了生成修复建议的工具，这些建议展示了适合当前敏捷开发环境的安全编码技巧。行业对安全软件开发的迫切需求，使得Gen AI与漏洞检测及风险分析的结合将成为未来阶段的标准操作流程。研究重点应投向AI模型开发投资，使其能适配多种编程语言和框架。将Gen AI实时集成至开发平台后，开发者可监控安全问题并即时获得反馈，这促使他们构建符合安全标准的应用程序。通过实施Gen AI，开发者能在安全数据环境中打造抵御安全威胁的应用程序。资源链接: Gen AI For Code VulnerabilityDetectionAndRiskAnalysis",

These cases represent only a fraction of the broader phenomenon, with many similar instances occurring outside the scope of WTO regulations. Key factors driving this trend include the expanding definition of national security and the rise of unilateral trade sanctions. Such practices have already had a profound negative impact on the multilateral trading system. Without effective measures to curb this trend, it will pose an even greater threat to the already fragile international trade system. In such a context, this article critically analyzes the current state of trade measure weaponization and proposes seven countermeasures to address this issue.将贸易措施武器化的趋势已成为日益严重的问题，世贸组织近期处理的若干案例便印证了这一点。这些案例仅是更广泛现象的冰山一角，许多类似事件发生在世贸组织监管范围之外。推动这一趋势的关键因素包括国家安全概念的持续扩大以及单边贸易制裁的兴起。此类做法已对多边贸易体系造成深远的负面影响。若不采取有效措施遏制这一趋势，将对本就脆弱的国际贸易体系构成更大威胁。在此背景下，本文批判性分析了贸易措施武器化的现状，并提出了应对该问题的七项对策。资源链接: Weaponization ofTradeMeasuresand Countermeasures",

        "content": "Capsular polysaccharides (CPS) and type 3 fimbriae are key virulence factors in hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp); however, their potential interactions remain inadequately understood. In this study, we isolated a K2-type hvKp strain, A25, which exhibited weak biofilm formation. Additionally, we identified a novel depolymerase, Dpo11, capable of specifically degrading the K2-type CPS. Upon treatment with Dpo11, strain A25 showed reduced virulence while exhibiting enhanced biofilm formation. Further studies revealed that CPS inhibits biofilm formation by downregulating the expression of the type 3 fimbriae operon mrkABCDF. And in vivo experiments demonstrated that CPS significantly suppresses the virulence of type 3 fimbriae. Meanwhie, we found that the inhibitory effect of CPS on biofilm formation is widely present in hvKp strains. These results demonstrated a trade-off relationship between the virulence factors CPS and type 3 fimbriae. When CPS is present, biofilm and virulence mediated by type 3 fimbriae are suppressed. In contrast, when CPS is absent, type 3 fimbriae become a more critical virulence factor, promoting biofilm formation and potentially facilitating chronic infection. In summary, our findings revealed a complex interplay between CPS and type 3 fimbriae, providing deeper insights into the pathogenicity of hvKp.荚膜多糖（CPS）和3型菌毛是高毒力肺炎克雷伯菌（hvKp）的关键毒力因子，但它们的潜在相互作用仍未被充分理解。本研究分离出一株K2型hvKp菌株A25，其生物膜形成能力较弱。同时，我们发现了一种新型解聚酶Dpo11，能特异性降解K2型CPS。经Dpo11处理后，A25菌株毒力降低，但生物膜形成能力增强。进一步研究表明，CPS通过下调3型菌毛操纵子mrkABCDF的表达来抑制生物膜形成。体内实验证实，CPS显著抑制3型菌毛的毒力。此外，我们发现CPS对生物膜形成的抑制作用在hvKp菌株中广泛存在。这些结果表明CPS与3型菌毛两种毒力因子存在此消彼长的关系：当CPS存在时，3型菌毛介导的生物膜和毒力受到抑制；反之当CPS缺失时，3型菌毛成为更关键的毒力因子，促进生物膜形成并可能助长慢性感染。本研究揭示了CPS与3型菌毛间复杂的相互作用机制，为理解hvKp的致病性提供了新视角。资源链接: Phage depolymerase modulates virulence and biofilm in hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae: a trade-off between capsular polysaccharide and type 3 fimbriae",

It aims to investigate the effects of dietary emulsifiers—sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)—in combination with the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) on gut microbiota composition and function. The study further validates the mechanistic role of gut microbes via fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and sodium butyrate supplementation. All experiments were conducted in SPF-grade animal facilities at China Agricultural University. Detailed experimental methods are described in the associated manuscript.This dataset includes raw gut microbiota data from the following three components:Exposure experiment (The effects of food emulsifiers on chlorpyrifos-induced intestinal inflammation): Mice were administered different combinations of CPF and emulsifiers (CMC or soy lecithin, SL) across six treatment groups.Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT): Fecal samples from exposed mice were transferred into microbiota-depleted mice (via antibiotic pretreatment) to assess functional consequences of altered microbial communities.Sodium butyrate supplementation: Butyrate was administered under CPF exposure conditions to evaluate its effect on restoring microbial and immune homeostasis.Microbial DNA was extracted from ileal and colonic contents. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA V3–V4 region was performed using the Illumina NovaSeq platform. Raw sequencing data were quality-filtered and trimmed using Fastp, followed by feature table construction via QIIME2 (v2022.2) using the DADA2 pipeline. Taxonomic annotation was carried out using the SILVA 138 database. All data were processed and exported using the Majorbio Cloud Platform (https://cloud.majorbio.com/).All sequencing samples passed quality control. A few low-depth or contaminated samples were removed and are not included in the dataset. No systematic missing data are present. The data are unrarefied and suitable for α/β diversity analysis, differential abundance analysis, and microbial community structure assessment.This dataset provides foundational information for exploring how co-exposure to food additives and environmental toxicants disrupts gut microbiota composition and metabolism.

        "content": "Prior research shows that formal controls such as explicit financial incentives and feedback about partner behavior (or equivalent mutual monitoring) help overcome relational risk in collaborative settings and increase cooperation. Environmental risk requires collaborators to infer cooperation from noisy outcomes, making attributions to their partner’s trustworthiness more difficult and cooperation harder to sustain. We investigate whether prior results on the effectiveness of (removed) formal controls hold under environmental risk. Importantly, we distinguish two common job designs (i.e., whether collaborators can mutually monitor cooperative actions or not) and isolate the effect of this variable from the effect of financial incentives. First, as a baseline with prior studies, we predict and find that mutual monitoring provides reliable information about partner behavior that mitigates difficulties for cooperation introduced by environmental risk. Second, financial incentives continue to have benefits for long-term cooperation (i.e., after their removal) not only when mutual monitoring is present, but also when mutual monitoring is absent and the difficulties for cooperation associated with environmental risk can take full effect. We provide supplemental evidence on the role of trust and perceived relational risk. Our results have implications for organizations’ control system design given environmental risk is inherent in business.先前研究表明，正式控制手段（如明确的经济激励和关于合作伙伴行为的反馈，或等效的相互监督）有助于克服协作环境中的关系风险并促进合作。环境风险要求合作者从嘈杂的结果中推断合作行为，这使得将结果归因于合作伙伴的可信度变得更加困难，合作也更难维持。我们探讨了在环境风险下，先前关于（已移除的）正式控制手段有效性的研究结果是否仍然成立。重要的是，我们区分了两种常见的工作设计（即合作者是否能相互监督合作行为），并将该变量的影响与经济激励的影响区分开来。首先，作为与先前研究的基线，我们预测并发现相互监督提供了关于合作伙伴行为的可靠信息，从而减轻了环境风险给合作带来的困难。其次，经济激励不仅在有相互监督时，而且在没有相互监督且环境风险对合作的困难影响完全显现时，仍对长期合作（即在其移除后）具有持续益处。我们还提供了关于信任和感知关系风险作用的补充证据。鉴于环境风险在商业中普遍存在，我们的研究结果对组织控制系统的设计具有启示意义。资源链接: The Effect ofControlSystems on Cooperation under EnvironmentalRisk",

Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is structured along seven areas we see as crucial for the development of ERM systems, supported by a structures literature analysis. Findings: Our literature review makes clear that of the seven areas presented in this article, especially risk aggregation, risk quantification and supporting decision-making are only covered by a minority of the publications. Practical implications: The paper offers valuable insights on how risk management can be linked with strategic decision-making by making use of risk aggregation techniques. Originality: Supported by our literature review, we present seven areas in which more effective risk governance and strengthened resilience can be created. By including these areas, we not only focus on one aspect but take a holistic view on ERM, including cultural, organizational and technical aspects. These arease are also grounded in a robus enterprise framework we lay out.我们主张建立一个集成且以决策为导向的企业风险管理系统（ERM），其中组织应关注价值驱动因素而非单纯追求风险最小化，并利用基于最佳可用信息的定量风险聚合技术。  . 设计/方法论/方法：分析围绕我们认为对ERM系统发展至关重要的七个领域展开，辅以结构化文献分析作为支撑。  . 研究结果：文献综述表明，本文提出的七个领域中，尤其是风险聚合、风险量化和支持决策方面，仅有少数文献涉及。  . 实践意义：本文通过运用风险聚合技术，为如何将风险管理与战略决策相结合提供了有价值的见解。  . 原创性：基于文献综述，我们提出了七个可提升风险治理效能与增强韧性的关键领域。通过涵盖这些领域，我们不仅聚焦单一维度，而是从文化、组织和技术层面整体审视ERM，这些领域均植根于我们构建的稳健企业框架之中。资源链接: EnterpriseRiskManagement: Improving EmbeddedRiskManagementandRiskGovernance",

        "content": "With the unsurpassed growth of cloud computing comes lots of security challenges that can be only solved by advanced threat detection solutions for safeguarding of sensible data and infrastructure. Traditional security system using rule-based intrusion detection and signaturebased threat monitoring can not prevent sophisticated cyber threats. As the generative AI models, VAEs, GANs, transformers and so on, they are also very powerful technology tools for real time anomaly detection &amp; risk mitigation. These AI driven models lead to the ability of early identification and response to threat patterns of normal and malicious behavior dynamically learned. In this paper, we explore the role of AI in cloud security, advantages of this AI over traditional methods, best way of implementing this AI, advantages of security using this AI, and the challenges in implementing this AI in cloud security. However, even with AI, the threat detection is more effective, but still some of the problems with interpretability of the model, adversarial robustness, computational overhead and regulator conducted compliance remain still. Other research directions in future are also presented for strengthening AI enhanced cybersecurity frameworks.随着云计算无可匹敌的发展，随之而来的是大量安全挑战，这些挑战只能通过先进的威胁检测解决方案来保护敏感数据和基础设施。传统的安全系统使用基于规则的入侵检测和基于签名的威胁监控，无法防范复杂的网络威胁。而生成式AI模型，如变分自编码器（VAE）、生成对抗网络（GAN）、Transformer等，同样是实时异常检测和风险缓解的强大技术工具。这些AI驱动模型能够动态学习正常和恶意行为的威胁模式，从而实现早期识别和响应。本文探讨了AI在云安全中的作用、相较于传统方法的优势、实施该AI的最佳方式、使用该AI的安全优势，以及在云安全中实施该AI所面临的挑战。然而，即便有了AI，威胁检测更为有效，但模型可解释性、对抗鲁棒性、计算开销和监管合规等问题依然存在。本文还提出了未来加强AI增强网络安全框架的其他研究方向。资源链接: AI-Driven ThreatDetection: Enhancing Cloud Security with Generative Models for Real-Time AnomalyDetectionandRiskMitigation",

        "content": "This study evaluates the application of change point detection (CPD) methodologies in the Agricultural Quarantine Inspection Monitoring (AQIM) program to identify significant shifts in pest arrival rates. Unlike prior work that focused on optimizing sampling strategies, this paper emphasizes the numerical evaluation of CPD algorithms for detecting pest outbreaks using AQIM data. The objective is to assess whether these methods can reliably detect and signal outbreaks when pest arrival rates exceed critical thresholds. Through extensive computational experiments, we compare the accuracy, sensitivity, and robustness of CPD methods under various outbreak scenarios and data conditions. The results demonstrate that CPD techniques, particularly cumulative sum (CUSUM) and exponential moving average (EMA), achieve high detection rates and low false alarm rates, even in challenging settings such as small outbreaks. These findings highlight the feasibility of integrating CPD algorithms into AQIM operations, providing a scalable and practical approach to enhancing outbreak detection and strengthening agricultural biosecurity in the context of global trade and evolving pest risks.本研究评估了变化点检测（CPD）方法在农业检疫监测（AQIM）项目中的应用，旨在识别有害生物到达率的显著变化。与先前专注于优化采样策略的研究不同，本文着重通过AQIM数据对CPD算法在有害生物暴发检测中的数值评估。研究目标是评估这些方法能否在有害生物到达率超过临界阈值时可靠地检测并预警暴发事件。通过大量计算实验，我们比较了不同暴发场景和数据条件下CPD方法的准确性、灵敏度和稳健性。结果表明，CPD技术（特别是累积和法CUSUM与指数移动平均法EMA）即使在小型暴发等挑战性场景中，仍能实现高检出率和低误报率。这些发现证实了将CPD算法整合到AQIM操作中的可行性，为加强全球贸易和不断演变的害虫风险背景下的暴发检测、提升农业生物安全提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案。资源链接: A Comparison of Change PointDetectionMethods for Pest OutbreakDetection",

        "content": "The wildlife trade poses a major threat to biodiversity, yet the drivers determining which species are traded are not fully understood. We collected trade records from online searches and two official trade databases, and collected nine traits that have been linked to the trade prevalence in reptiles through the latest published trait datasets and related papers. Of the 10,919 reptile species in our dataset, at least 3,889 species (35.6%) were currently in trade. Through a comprehensive analysis of trade data, we analyzed which factors predispose reptile species to be traded. Given the increased attention given to the wildlife trade, we suggest that efforts should prioritize the protection of species exhibiting traits that make them highly susceptible to exploitation. This dataset provides essential foundational information for research in reptile ecology and conservation biology. It also serves as a significant platform for data sharing and communication in regional and global reptile conservation efforts.野生动物贸易对生物多样性构成重大威胁，然而决定哪些物种被交易的驱动因素尚未完全明确。我们通过在线搜索和两个官方贸易数据库收集了贸易记录，并通过最新发布的特征数据集和相关文献整理了与爬行动物贸易普遍性相关的九种特征。在我们数据集包含的10,919种爬行动物中，至少有3,889种（35.6%）目前处于贸易状态。通过对贸易数据的全面分析，我们研究了哪些因素导致爬行动物物种更易被交易。鉴于野生动物贸易日益受到关注，我们建议保护工作应优先关注那些因自身特征极易遭受开发的物种。该数据集为爬行动物生态学与保护生物学研究提供了重要基础信息，同时也为区域及全球爬行动物保护工作的数据共享与交流搭建了重要平台。资源链接: A dataset on the trade status and species traits of reptiles worldwide",

        "content": "We report an ultra wideband, high reflectivity backside coated low dispersion mirror (BASIC LDM) with a working wavelength range of 700-1050 nm. BASIC LDM consists of three main parts: front anti reflective coating, 1mm quartz substrate, and back coated dispersion compensating mirror. The light initially passes through the anti reflection coating and quartz substrate, and then reflects inside the dispersion compensating mirror. The substrate generates positive dispersion, while the dispersion compensating mirror provides equivalent negative dispersion, thereby achieving zero group delay dispersion (GDD) over an ultra wide bandwidth. In a 16.4 fs ultrafast laser system, the laser-induced damage threshold of BASIC LDM was measured to be 0.11 J/cm2. The application performance of BASIC LDM was evaluated, and a 13.6fs pulse was reflected four times to generate a 13.3fs output pulse. This study introduces a new design method for low dispersion mirrors with wider operating bandwidth and lays the foundation for advancing ultrafast laser systems with wider spectral ranges.我们报道了一种超宽带、高反射率背涂层低色散镜（BASIC LDM），其工作波长范围为700-1050纳米。BASIC LDM由三个主要部分组成：前表面抗反射涂层、1毫米石英基底和背涂层色散补偿镜。光线首先穿过抗反射涂层和石英基底，然后在色散补偿镜内部反射。基底产生正色散，而色散补偿镜提供等效负色散，从而在超宽带宽范围内实现零群延迟色散（GDD）。在16.4飞秒超快激光系统中，测得BASIC LDM的激光诱导损伤阈值为0.11 J/cm²。评估了BASIC LDM的应用性能，将13.6飞秒脉冲反射四次后产生13.3飞秒的输出脉冲。本研究提出了一种具有更宽工作带宽的低色散镜设计新方法，为推进更宽光谱范围的超快激光系统奠定了基础。资源链接: Dispersive Mirror Data",

        "content": "  At the heart of this work lies the challenge of building reliable PD curve models for portfolios that, for all intents and purposes, have never defaulted, even while keeping Basel rules in check. Instead of following a neat checklist, I wondered just how effective our usual modeling tricks really are; it turns out they often miss the mark when estimating risk for these one-of-a-kind portfolios. I rummaged through heaps of data, old credit records, broad economic shifts, and even performance details specific to different sectors, to uncover some unexpected insights. Blending number crunching with real-world perspective (yes, mixing hard math with a bit of human judgment) seems to give a noticeably better estimate of default probability for accounts typically seen as almost risk-free. This finding rings especially true in places like healthcare, where many portfolios show barely any defaults but also lack advanced risk-check setups. By carving out a more or less structured way to measure default risk, the study ends up giving healthcare providers practical (if not perfectionist) tools to fine-tune their credit risk decisions. In many cases, this mix of approaches paves the way for better overall regulatory compliance and risk management across the financial world, making systems a bit more resilient against economic ups and downs.All in all, this research not only plugs a big gap in current studies but also lays down a foundation for future work on risk modeling in niche sectors.这项工作的核心挑战在于，如何为实际上从未违约的投资组合建立可靠的违约概率(PD)曲线模型，同时确保符合巴塞尔协议要求。与遵循刻板的检查清单不同，我深入探究了常规建模方法对这些特殊组合的风险评估效果——结果发现它们往往存在偏差。通过梳理海量数据、历史信用记录、宏观经济波动乃至各行业特有的表现细节，我挖掘出若干反直觉的洞见。将数据运算与现实视角结合（即在严谨数学模型中加入人为判断），能显著提升对那些被视为近乎零风险账户的违约概率预测精度。这一发现在医疗健康等领域尤为突出——该行业组合虽鲜有违约案例，却也缺乏完善的风险监测机制。本研究通过构建一套相对结构化的违约风险评估框架，为医疗机构提供了实用（虽非完美）的信用决策优化工具。这种混合方法在多数情况下能促进金融界整体监管合规与风险管理水平，增强系统应对经济波动的韧性。总体而言，该研究不仅填补了现有学术空白，更为细分领域的风险建模奠定了未来研究基石。资源链接: Methodologies to Develop Low Default Probability of Default Curve Models for the Portfolios with Zero Default Rates in-line with BASEL Requirements",

        "content": "Analytical research papers serve as critical tools for examining complex issues through a structured and evidence-based approach. Effective research writing bridges the gap between knowledge acquisition and scholarly discourse, requiring methodological rigor, logical coherence, and critical engagement with existing literature. The introduction plays a foundational role in framing the research problem, defining key concepts, and establishing the analytical framework. As Sparrow et al. (2004) highlight, clear grading criteria reinforce structured academic writing, ensuring that arguments are systematically developed and assessed. Moreover, McMurray et al. (2019) emphasize the role of collaborative research, underscoring the need for introductions to anticipate peer critique and academic debate. This paper provides a comprehensive guide to crafting an analytical research paper, focusing on thesis development, evidence evaluation, argument structuring, and the integration of theoretical perspectives. By outlining best practices and emphasizing the iterative nature of academic writing, this guide equips students and researchers with the necessary tools to construct well-reasoned, analytically rigorous research papers that contribute to scholarly discourse.分析性研究论文是通过结构化、基于证据的方法来审视复杂问题的重要工具。有效的研究写作弥合了知识获取与学术讨论之间的鸿沟，需要方法的严谨性、逻辑的连贯性以及对现有文献的批判性参与。引言在界定研究问题、定义关键概念和建立分析框架方面起着基础性作用。正如Sparrow等人（2004年）所指出的，清晰的评分标准强化了结构化的学术写作，确保论点得到系统性的发展和评估。此外，McMurray等人（2019年）强调了合作研究的作用，指出引言需要预见同行批评和学术辩论。本文提供了撰写分析性研究论文的全面指南，重点关注论文主题的展开、证据评估、论点构建以及理论视角的整合。通过概述最佳实践并强调学术写作的迭代性质，本指南为学生和研究人员提供了必要的工具，以构建论证充分、分析严谨的研究论文，从而为学术讨论做出贡献。资源链接: Mastering Research Writing: A Comprehensive Guide for Students and Scholars",

        "content": "Magnetically agitated miniaturised continuous stirred tank reactors (m-CSTRs) are an attractive tool for the investigation of reaction kinetics, as they combine active stirring with enhanced heat and mass transfer due to their small dimensions, while their compatibility with in-situ spectroscopic techniques enables real-time reaction monitoring and high-throughput data acquisition. This study presents the development of a 2.65 ml m-CSTR, integrated with in situ Raman spectroscopy for real-time kinetic data acquisition in continuous flow systems through steady-state experimentation. The reactor, featuring a temperature-controlled stainless-steel chamber with a top quartz glass window and a PTFE slotted impeller, was assessed for its macro- and micro-mixing characteristics at flowrates between 0.5 and 4 mL/min. The slotted impeller led to near-ideal CSTR behaviour and improved micromixing quality in comparison to conventional cross stir bars of similar dimensions. Using the imine synthesis of n-benzylidenebenzylamine from benzaldehyde and benzylamine as a model reaction with direct composition measurement inside the reactor, kinetic parameters were determined and the most informative design space was identified to be in the region of high reactant concentrations, short residence times (i.e., high flowrate) and lower temperatures.

        "content": "Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is rapidly transforming the financial system through provision of decentralized alternatives to traditional financial services. However, the inherent risks that come with DeFi, such as smart contract exploits, liquidity crises, market manipulation, and volatility of cryptocurrency assets, are significant barriers to its adoption. Traditional risk management measures are insufficient due to the decentralized, permissionless, and open nature of DeFi platforms. Hence, machine learning (ML) algorithms have been spoken of as one of the promising solutions for DeFi risk management and assessment automation (Adebayo 2023). This paper presents the application of machine learning techniques to DeFi risk analysis. From huge volumes of data from DeFi protocols, including transaction history, smart contract interactions, market trends, and token price movements, ML models can identify patterns and predict probable risks, e.g., smart contract failure, market crash, and liquidity crisis. We touch upon significant ML models such as supervised learning (e.g., decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines), unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering algorithms), and reinforcement learning and show their usability in risk prediction, anomaly detection, and decision-making within DeFi protocols. Furthermore, pairing the advanced ML models with decentralized oracles and data sources anchored in blockchain technology would make the accuracy and speed of risk assessments stronger to allow continuous monitoring and countering of threats. We briefly address constraints and setbacks related to implementing machine learning within risk management for DeFi, i.e., the issue of the quality of available data, explaining the machine models, and development of DeFi protocols. The study highlights the potential for ML to contribute to the future of DeFi through enabling instruments for more efficient risk tracking and mitigation, increased confidence and security in the system.去中心化金融（DeFi）正通过提供传统金融服务的去中心化替代方案，迅速改变金融体系。然而，DeFi固有的风险，如智能合约漏洞、流动性危机、市场操纵以及加密货币资产波动性，是其广泛采用的重要障碍。由于DeFi平台去中心化、无需许可和开放的特性，传统的风险管理措施显得不足。因此，机器学习（ML）算法被视为DeFi风险管理和评估自动化的有前景的解决方案之一（Adebayo 2023）。本文探讨了机器学习技术在DeFi风险分析中的应用。通过分析DeFi协议产生的大量数据，包括交易历史、智能合约交互、市场趋势和代币价格变动，机器学习模型能够识别模式并预测潜在风险，例如智能合约故障、市场崩盘和流动性危机。我们讨论了重要的机器学习模型，如监督学习（如决策树、随机森林和支持向量机）、无监督学习（如聚类算法）以及强化学习，并展示了它们在DeFi协议中风险预测、异常检测和决策制定方面的实用性。此外，将先进的机器学习模型与基于区块链技术的去中心化预言机和数据源相结合，可以增强风险评估的准确性和速度，实现持续监控和威胁应对。我们还简要探讨了在DeFi风险管理中应用机器学习所面临的限制和挑战，包括可用数据质量问题、机器学习模型的可解释性以及DeFi协议的开发。本研究强调了机器学习通过提供更高效的风险跟踪和缓解工具，提升系统信心和安全性，从而为DeFi未来发展做出贡献的潜力。资源链接: Machine learning algorithms for DeFiriskassessment",

        "content": "Recently, banks have been contending with increasing credit risk, particularly as financial markets display signs of instability. The focal point of these concerns is credit concentration risk, which highlights the potential for significant losses when a borrower has excessive credit connections. In regions like China, banks frequently encounter difficulties due to unreliable data sources, creating challenges for traditional risk assessment models(Jiang C et al., 2024). Conventional techniques often struggle to navigate such uncertain conditions, leading to a growing interest in innovative solutions such as rough set theory, a method that can provide insights even in situations of incomplete data. With the continuously evolving financial landscape, there is a critical need for adaptable quantitative approaches to effectively manage credit concentration risk. This research urges a reevaluation of risk management practices to address the complexities of today’s financial environment.近期，银行正面临日益加剧的信用风险，尤其在金融市场显现不稳定迹象之际。这些担忧的核心在于信用集中风险——当借款人存在过度信贷关联时，可能引发重大损失。在中国等地区，银行常因数据来源不可靠而陷入困境，这给传统风险评估模型带来了挑战（Jiang C等，2024）。传统方法往往难以应对此类不确定状况，使得粗糙集理论等创新解决方案备受关注，该方法即便在不完整数据条件下仍能提供有效洞见。随着金融环境持续演变，亟需采用适应性强的量化手段来有效管控信用集中风险。本研究呼吁重新审视风险管理实践，以应对当今金融环境的复杂性。资源链接: Quantitative Methods for Assessing Credit ConcentrationRiskin Banks: Practical Approaches for Limited Data Scenarios",

        "content": "Financial markets these days are more tangled than ever, so we really need some clever tools to get a read on how the economy moves. Lots of folks now lean on techniques like Vector Autoregression (VAR) and its sidekick, Impulse Response Function (IRF), since they do a nice job of showing how various time series data connect—even when the links aren’t crystal clear. When analysts use a VAR approach, they often notice that a jolt in one variable sends ripples through others, hinting at effects on spending and lending patterns; this kind of chain reaction, for example, has popped up in studies on intercorporate lending and its knock-on effects on economic balance (Bialek-Jaworska et al., 2020). Lately, there’s been, in most cases, a bit of a comeback in structural macroeconomic forecasting—thanks in part to recent progress in dynamic stochastic general equilibrium theory—which has helped renew interest in these VAR methods (Francis X Diebold). In this write-up, I’ll go over how these models work in practice and why they still matter in everyday financial analysis and decision-making, even when things aren’t perfectly predictable.如今的金融市场比以往任何时候都更加错综复杂，因此我们确实需要一些聪明的工具来解读经济走势。现在许多人倾向于使用向量自回归（VAR）及其辅助工具脉冲响应函数（IRF）等技术，因为它们能很好地展示各种时间序列数据之间的联系——即使这些关联并不十分清晰。当分析师采用VAR方法时，他们常常注意到一个变量的冲击会波及其他变量，暗示着对支出和借贷模式的影响；例如，这种连锁反应在企业间借贷及其对经济平衡的后续影响研究中已经显现（Bialek-Jaworska等人，2020年）。最近在大多数情况下，结构宏观经济预测有所复苏——部分归功于动态随机一般均衡理论的最新进展——这有助于重新激发人们对这些VAR方法的兴趣（Francis X Diebold）。在本文中，我将探讨这些模型在实际中如何运作，以及为什么它们在日常金融分析和决策中仍然重要，即使事情并非完全可预测。资源链接: Practical Application of Vector Autoregression Using Impulse Response Function Modeling in the Financial Industry",

        "content": "Machine learning and big data analytics are now part of stress testing and scenario analysis, sparking a noticeable shift in how banks handle risk. As financial markets get more tangled and risks loom larger, older methods just don’t cut it these days—generally speaking, they miss the mark on today’s challenges. This essay looks into how newer, cleverer analytical techniques can ramp up both the accuracy and impact of risk assessments, helping institutions spot and dodge systemic problems more effectively. It also fits well with the growing push for banks to reinvent their risk management systems in light of changing regulations and environmental pressures (HUSEYNOV et al., 2024). Recent studies on hybrid risk cultures even point out that management teams view risk very differently, which shows why a one-size-fits-all approach simply won’t do (Ingram et al., 2014). All in all, this opening overview gets us ready to dive deeper into how machine learning and big data join forces to reshape financial risk management.机器学习与大数据分析现已融入压力测试和情景分析领域，显著改变了银行处理风险的方式。随着金融市场日益复杂、风险不断加剧，传统方法已难以应对当前挑战——总体而言，这些方法无法满足当下需求。本文探讨了如何通过更智能的新型分析技术提升风险评估的准确性与影响力，助力机构更有效地识别和规避系统性风险。这也契合了监管要求与环境压力下银行重塑风险管理体系的迫切需求（HUSEYNOV等，2024）。关于混合风险文化的最新研究甚至指出，管理团队对风险的认知存在显著差异，这证明一刀切的方法根本行不通（Ingram等，2014）。总之，本概述为后续深入探究机器学习与大数据如何协同重塑金融风险管理奠定了基础。资源链接: Incorporating Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics in Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis for EnhancedRiskManagementin Financial Institutions",

        "content": "This research paper digs into how climate risks that come with transition hit economic stability and shape sustainable policy in the Gulf Cooperation Council region. It starts by pointing out that the current methods for modeling these risks just aren’t cutting it and then gets into a detailed look at greenhouse gas numbers, economic trends, existing rules, and climate impact reviews gathered from across the GCC. In many cases, this blend of data and viewpoints unexpectedly reveals weaknesses lurking in the region’s economic setup, which could make it hard to cope with rapid climate changes. Generally speaking, these shortcomings in modeling intensify the region’s exposure to climate risks, hinting that bolstering data sharing and tweaking how we analyze things is really needed to back sound policy decisions. The study doesn’t stop there—its findings ripple into healthcare too, because climate-driven economic shifts might eventually overload public health systems, making it trickier to ensure good health outcomes and manage resources. In most cases, the research nudges us toward breaking out of traditional silos by mixing environmental science, economics, and healthcare policy to build stronger resilience against climate shocks. By weaving together how climate variables and economic factors interact, this work paints a picture of how smarter, proactive policy can lift the region’s ability to adapt, setting the stage for not only sustainable growth but ultimately a healthier population in the GCC.本研究论文深入探讨了转型伴随的气候风险如何冲击海湾合作委员会地区的经济稳定并塑造可持续政策。文章首先指出当前的风险建模方法存在不足，随后详细分析了从海合会各国收集的温室气体数据、经济趋势、现行法规及气候影响评估。这些数据与观点的融合往往意外暴露出该地区经济结构中潜藏的脆弱性，这些弱点可能阻碍其应对快速气候变化的能力。总体而言，建模缺陷加剧了该地区面临的气候风险，表明亟需加强数据共享和改进分析方法以支撑明智的决策。研究影响不仅限于此——其发现还波及医疗领域，因为气候驱动的经济转型最终可能压垮公共卫生体系，使保障健康成果和资源配置更为困难。多数情况下，研究促使我们打破传统壁垒，通过融合环境科学、经济学和医疗政策来增强气候冲击抵御能力。通过揭示气候变量与经济因素的相互作用，本研究描绘了更智慧、更前瞻的政策如何提升地区适应能力，不仅为可持续增长奠定基础，最终还将促进海合会民众的健康水平。资源链接: Assessing Climate TransitionRiskin the GCC Region: Challenges and Modeling Techniques for Sustainable Policy Development",

        "content": "The increasing complexity of financial instruments and the dynamic nature of market conditions underscore the necessity for robust actuarial modeling techniques aimed at predicting default rates and credit losses. In particular, the application of innovative backtesting and stress testing methodologies plays a crucial role in evaluating model effectiveness and ensuring regulatory compliance. Standard approaches frequently overlook the intricate relationships between various risk factors, which can lead to significant underestimations of potential losses. For instance, the reliance on traditional Value-at-Risk (VaR) models is often insufficient; enhanced methodologies, such as those discussed in (Lima LR et al.), propose more powerful backtesting frameworks capable of assessing competing models performance directly. Furthermore, the asset value-based models, as highlighted in (Engel et al., 2008), emphasize the importance of market dynamics in credit portfolio risk valuation, revealing that updated capital requirements may inadequately safeguard against extreme loss events. This paper aims to explore these innovative approaches further, establishing a narrative on their practical implications in financial risk management.金融工具的日益复杂和市场环境的动态变化凸显了采用稳健精算建模技术预测违约率和信用损失的必要性。尤其值得注意的是，创新性回测与压力测试方法的应用对评估模型有效性、确保监管合规具有关键作用。传统方法往往忽视各类风险因素间的复杂关联，这可能导致对潜在损失的严重低估。例如，单纯依赖传统风险价值（VaR）模型通常存在不足；如（Lima LR等人）所述，增强型方法论提出了能直接评估竞争模型表现的更强效回测框架。此外，（Engel等人，2008年）强调的基于资产价值模型揭示了市场动态对信用组合风险评估的重要性，研究表明更新后的资本要求可能不足以防范极端损失事件。本文旨在深入探讨这些创新方法，系统阐述其在金融风险管理中的实践意义。资源链接: Actuarial Modeling for Projected Default Rates and Credit Losses in the Financial Sector: An Innovative Approach to Backtesting and Stress Testing",

This concept encapsulates various risks, including credit, market, and operational risks, which are crucial for effective financial management and regulatory compliance. The mathematical explanation and derivation of the aggregate cost of risk serve not only to clarify the relationships between these risks but also to enhance transparency and predictability in risk assessment. In recent years, the proliferation of sophisticated models, particularly those grounded in Artificial Intelligence, has further complicated this landscape; many of these models remain black-boxes in their decision-making processes, hampering trust and interpretability ((Hassija V et al., 2023)). As the need for explainable AI (XAI) methodologies escalates, understanding the mathematical principles underlying the aggregate cost of risk becomes imperative for both theoretical inquiry and practical application ((Ali S et al., 2023)).银行业运营于一个复杂的环境中，金融风险具有内在性与多面性，因此必须严格理解风险总成本。这一概念涵盖了信用风险、市场风险和操作风险等多种风险，对于有效的财务管理和监管合规至关重要。风险总成本的数学解释与推导不仅能阐明这些风险之间的关系，还能提升风险评估的透明度和可预测性。近年来，复杂模型（尤其是基于人工智能的模型）的激增进一步加剧了这一领域的复杂性；其中许多模型在决策过程中仍处于黑箱状态，削弱了信任度与可解释性（Hassija V等，2023）。随着对可解释人工智能（XAI）方法的需求日益增长，理解风险总成本背后的数学原理已成为理论探索与实际应用的必然要求（Ali S等，2023）。资源链接: Mathematical Explanation and Derivation of the Aggregate Cost ofRiskin the Banking Industry",

Understanding the determinants of Loss Given Default (LGD) is crucial for accurately assessing the risk profiles of these institutions. This is compounded by difficulties in obtaining reliable recovery and default rate data, which are essential to inform lending practices and regulatory compliance. Research indicates that cultural proximity between lenders and borrowers can significantly influence credit dynamics, reducing default rates and facilitating better repayment outcomes(Fisman R et al., 2017). Moreover, the rise of advanced financial instruments has introduced complexity into how credit risks are evaluated, suggesting an urgent need for frameworks that account for these evolving conditions(Marti G Subrahmanyam et al., 2014). Consequently, this essay aims to elucidate the challenges faced by small banks in determining LGD, emphasizing the necessity for robust analytical approaches to navigate data-related impediments.小型银行的财务稳定性正因其对信贷损失的脆弱性而受到日益严格的审视，尤其是在经济衰退时期。准确评估这些机构的风险状况，关键在于理解违约损失率（LGD）的决定因素。而获取可靠的回收率和违约率数据存在困难，这进一步加剧了问题的复杂性，此类数据对指导贷款实践和监管合规至关重要。研究表明，贷款方与借款方之间的文化亲近性能显著影响信贷动态，降低违约率并促成更佳的还款结果（Fisman R等，2017）。此外，先进金融工具的兴起为信用风险评估方式增添了复杂性，这表明亟需建立能够适应这些演变条件的分析框架（Marti G Subrahmanyam等，2014）。因此，本文旨在阐明小型银行在确定违约损失率时面临的挑战，并强调采用强健分析方法以克服数据相关障碍的必要性。资源链接: Determining Loss Given Default for Small Banks with Recovery and Default Rate Data Issues",

        "content": "The rapid evolution of financial fraud, coupled with increasing regulatory scrutiny, challenges conventional fraud detection approaches. Traditional machine learning models struggle to capture complex fraud networks and evolving transactional patterns. This study proposes a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based fraud detection framework, integrating network science, deep learning, and Explainable AI (XAI) to enhance fraud prevention in financial systems while ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and knowyour-customer (KYC) regulations. By structuring financial transactions as graphs, GNNs identify hidden dependencies, collusive fraud, and synthetic identity fraud more effectively than traditional models. We benchmark GNNs against Random Forest and XGBoost, demonstrating superior recall and detection accuracy. Furthermore, we evaluate computational efficiency and real-time feasibility, addressing the scalability challenges of AI-driven fraud detection in highfrequency financial environments. Our findings suggest that integrating GNNs into financial information systems and fintech platforms significantly enhances fraud detection accuracy, risk assessment, and regulatory transparency. This research offers actionable insights for financial institutions, regulators, and AI practitioners, positioning graph-based AI methodologies as a critical innovation for ethical, scalable, and compliant financial crime prevention.金融欺诈的快速演变与日益严格的监管审查对传统欺诈检测方法提出了挑战。传统机器学习模型难以捕捉复杂的欺诈网络和不断变化的交易模式。本研究提出基于图神经网络（GNN）的欺诈检测框架，整合网络科学、深度学习和可解释人工智能（XAI），在确保符合反洗钱（AML）和了解客户（KYC）法规的同时，提升金融系统的欺诈防范能力。通过将金融交易构建为图结构，GNN比传统模型更有效地识别隐藏关联、共谋欺诈和合成身份欺诈。我们将GNN与随机森林和XGBoost进行基准测试，证明其具有更高的召回率和检测准确率。此外，我们还评估了计算效率和实时可行性，解决了高频金融环境中AI驱动欺诈检测的可扩展性挑战。研究结果表明，将GNN整合到金融信息系统和金融科技平台中，能显著提升欺诈检测准确性、风险评估能力和监管透明度。本研究为金融机构、监管者和AI从业者提供了可行见解，确立了基于图结构的AI方法作为道德、可扩展且合规的金融犯罪预防关键创新技术。资源链接: AI-Powered FraudDetectionin Financial Services: GNN, Compliance Challenges, andRiskMitigation",

        "content": "Cyber risk poses severe challenges to the society and has become an important theme in risk management and insurance. Yet its statistical features and how it evolves over time are not sufficiently understood. This paper focuses on two key dimensions of cyber risk—loss severity and tail risk—using three different cyber loss databases. We first focus on the dynamics of loss severity, identifying structural shifts in distributions through a Fr´echet-based change point detection method and applying inverse probability weighting to control for selection bias. Our results indicate an increase in the severity of malicious cyber losses since 2018, while negligent cyber incidents have exhibited a declining trend in severity. Then we propose a combined approach with accurate tail index estimation and change point detection and find that cyber loss distributions remain heavy tailed over time, despite heterogeneity across different risk categories. Finally, a numerical analysis is presented to illustrate how losses of a simulated cyber insurance portfolio evolve over time, emphasizing the importance of incorporating the dynamic properties of cyber risk into pricing strategies for insurance companies.网络风险给社会带来了严峻挑战，已成为风险管理和保险领域的重要议题。然而其统计特征及随时间演变的规律尚未得到充分认知。本文基于三个不同的网络损失数据库，重点研究了网络风险的两个关键维度——损失严重程度与尾部风险。我们首先运用基于Fr´echet分布的变点检测方法识别损失严重度分布的结构性突变，并采用逆概率加权法控制选择偏差。研究发现自2018年以来，恶意网络攻击造成的损失严重程度呈上升趋势，而过失型网络事件的损失严重度则持续下降。随后我们提出一种融合精确尾部指数估计与变点检测的综合分析方法，发现尽管不同风险类别存在异质性，网络损失分布始终保持着厚尾特征。最后通过数值模拟展示了网络保险组合损失的动态演变过程，论证了保险公司在定价策略中纳入网络风险动态特征的重要性。资源链接: The Changing Landscape of CyberRisk: An Empirical Analysis of Loss Severity and Tail Dynamics",

        "content": "Informal risk sharing, an important coping strategy, is mediated by social networks. Does risk sharing extend beyond immediate connections? If so, what is its radius? I examine the radius of risk sharing as a function of network structure. To do so, I employ community detection-a tool imported from network science-and dyadic regression. I nd evidence the radius of risk sharing extends beyond direct connections. Using data from a behavioral experiment in Colombia, I nd that detected community co-membership and distance-2 connections (i.e., friends of friends) explain co-membership in experimental risk sharing groups. Using data from a village census in Tanzania, I nd that distance-2 and 3 connections explain risk sharing transfers, but detected community co-membership does not. I address a crucial issue of network sampling in the Colombia illustration using simulation methods, nding my preferred speci cation is robust to this concern. ese methods may bene t those who seek to understand the quality of risk sharing when risk sharing groups are loosely de ned and illegible to outsiders.非正式风险分担作为一种重要的应对策略，其运作依赖于社交网络。这种风险分担是否会超越直接关联？如果会，其作用半径有多大？我通过将网络结构作为变量，研究了风险分担的作用范围。为此，我采用了源自网络科学的社区检测工具和二元回归分析。研究发现，风险分担的作用范围确实超越了直接关联。基于哥伦比亚行为实验数据，我发现实验性风险分担小组的成员构成可通过检测到的社区共同隶属关系和二阶连接（即朋友的朋友）来解释。而坦桑尼亚村庄普查数据显示，风险分担转移行为可由二阶和三阶连接解释，但社区共同隶属关系则无此作用。针对哥伦比亚案例中网络抽样的关键问题，我通过模拟方法验证了所选模型的稳健性。这些方法有助于研究者理解当风险分担群体边界模糊且对外界不透明时，其运作质量如何。资源链接: Social Network Structure and the Radius ofRiskSharing",

        "content": "As children grow, they learn to understand and navigate fairness norms and may intervene in unfair situations at a personal cost, either by punishing the wrongdoer or helping the victim. This study examines how children (N = 196, ages 4–10) balance fairness and self-interest when making costly third-party interventions. Using a third-party trust game, children made decisions in both punishment and helping contexts across three levels of unfairness. Results revealed that younger children, in low unfairness conditions, displayed more intervention behaviors than older children, often going beyond what was required to restore fairness. In contrast, older children’s interventions were more aligned with the fairness needs of the situation. Age influenced the proportion of children displaying fairness-oriented or self-interest-oriented behaviors, especially in punishment contexts, with younger children showing more unclear decision-making. Negative empathy was found to predict fairness-oriented decisions in punishment situations, with children exhibiting higher negative empathy more likely to choose fairness. The relationship between empathy and third-party helping behavior was less clear, as helping behavior both reflects fairness and compensates the victim altruistically. These findings suggest that as children age, they become more discerning in balancing fairness and self-interest, and that empathy plays a key role in shaping their third-party intervention decisions, especially in punitive contexts.随着儿童的成长，他们学会理解并运用公平规范，甚至可能不惜个人代价干预不公平现象，包括惩罚违规者或帮助受害者。本研究探讨了196名4至10岁儿童在进行需要付出代价的第三方干预时，如何平衡公平与自利。通过第三方信任游戏，孩子们在惩罚和帮助两种情境下针对三种不公平程度做出决策。结果显示，在轻微不公平条件下，低龄儿童比年长儿童表现出更多干预行为，其程度常超出恢复公平所需；而年长儿童的干预行为与情境的公平需求更为匹配。年龄因素显著影响儿童选择公平导向或自利导向行为的比例，尤其在惩罚情境中，低龄儿童表现出更模糊的决策倾向。研究发现负向共情能预测惩罚情境中的公平导向决策，共情能力越强的儿童越倾向于选择公平。共情与第三方帮助行为的关系较不明确，因帮助行为既体现公平又包含对受害者的利他补偿。这些发现表明，儿童随着年龄增长会更精准地权衡公平与自利，共情（尤其在惩罚情境中）对其第三方干预决策具有关键影响。资源链接: The Development of Third-Party Intervention in Children Aged 4–10: The Trade-off between Aversion to Unfairness and Self-interest",

Scalability and adaptability make it especially suitable for dynamic, multi-cloud environments. The transformative role of artificial intelligence in automating drift detection, operational risk mitigation, and compliance support is outlined in a nutshell.

        "content": "The recently adopted Data Act (DA) creates a complex system of data access, (re-)use and portability rights whose deeper implications are yet to be fully unpacked. Underpinning this sweeping intervention in data transactions is a general desire by the EU legislator to preserve and foster a competitive data market, favour fairness in data contracts, allow users of Internet of Things (IoT) products to have access to their co-generated data, and to empower public sector bodies, in certain special situations, to access privately held datasets. These are ambitious policy objectives that align well with the European Commission’s Data Strategy.Naturally, as in every complex legal intervention aimed at regulating multifaceted dynamics, rules and rights are accompanied by exceptions and carve-outs. Trade secrets (TS), given their ability to cover situations that may escape the scope of (other) intellectual property rights, have attained a very distinctive place in the DA’s architecture. Not only TS feature quite prominently as a tool to mitigate and, one might say, undermine, some of the data access and sharing obligations of the DA. They are also the recipients of a very specific and unique set of regulatory interventions, including a duty to notify a competent authority which will be tasked with what can be arguably viewed as a prima-facie validity assessment of the trade secret claim. Furthermore, specific rules on technical protection measures could arguably equip TS with remedies that go beyond the traditional limits of this category. These two innovations are central to the present analysis and will be assessed in relation to the two specific data sharing regimes within which they are developed: Internet of Things (IoT) and Business-to-Government (B2G) data sharing obligations.This paper, while building on previous scholar analysis, focuses specifically on information that has the simultaneous legal status of data and trade secret. It centres on the potentially conflicting obligations to protect, yet to share, such information as well as on the interfaces developed in the DA to address this conflict. It argues that the EU legislator may have effectively created a new (sub)category of TS, governed by their own subset of rules and procedures found in the DA, for those cases where TS are embedded in IoT or B2G data sharing obligations. The paper refers to this new category as data secrets. The analysis proceeds as follows: Section 2 examines the foundational principles and objectives underpinning the DA and the EU Trade Secrets Directive (TSD), identifying key challenges in uniting these separate approaches. Section 3 examines how the DA addresses TS protection while pursuing greater data access by focusing on the specific regimes for IoT and B2G data sharing. Section 4 highlights two key novel characteristics of data secrets that are relatively foreign to conventional notions of trade secrecy. The first is the decision-making powers of competent authorities as intermediate bodies in confirming trade secrecy. The second is the central role of technical protection measures as technological means for achieving trade secrecy and potentially expanding its effects. Section 5 concludes that data secrets manifestly supplement existing legal structures for trade secret protection in the EU data economy, but in doing so open up a number of theoretical and interpretative questions that seek proper systematization.新近通过的《数据法案》（DA）构建了一套复杂的数据访问、（再）使用与可携权体系，其深层影响尚待全面解析。欧盟立法者对此番数据交易全面干预的核心诉求在于：维护并培育竞争性数据市场、促进数据合同公平性、确保物联网（IoT）产品用户获取其协同生成的数据，以及在特定特殊情形下授权公共部门获取私有数据集。这些雄心勃勃的政策目标与欧盟委员会《数据战略》高度契合。. . 如同所有旨在规范多维动态的复杂法律干预，该法案的权利规则亦伴随例外与豁免条款。鉴于商业秘密（TS）能够覆盖其他知识产权无法触及的情形，其在《数据法案》架构中获得了独特地位——不仅作为关键工具显著缓解（甚至可理解为削弱）部分数据访问与共享义务，更成为一系列特殊监管措施的适用对象，包括需向主管机构申报的义务（该机构将承担对商业秘密主张的表面有效性评估职责）。此外，关于技术保护措施的专门规则可能突破传统商业秘密救济边界。这两项创新构成本文分析核心，将结合其适用的两大具体数据共享机制——物联网（IoT）与企业对政府（B2G）数据共享义务——进行评估。. . 本文在既有学术研究基础上，聚焦同时具备数据与商业秘密双重法律属性的信息，重点探讨保护与共享此类信息的潜在义务冲突，以及《数据法案》为解决冲突设计的衔接机制。本文主张：当商业秘密嵌入物联网或B2G数据共享义务时，欧盟立法者可能已实质创设了受《数据法案》专门规则程序管辖的新（子）类别商业秘密。本文将之命名为”数据秘密”。. . 具体分析路径如下：第二节考察《数据法案》与《欧盟商业秘密指令》（TSD）的核心理念与目标，揭示二者融合的关键挑战；第三节通过物联网与B2G数据共享的具体制度，剖析《数据法案》在扩大数据访问同时保护商业秘密的路径；第四节指出数据秘密相对传统商业秘密观念的两大新颖特征：一是主管机构作为中间主体确认商业秘密的决策权，二是技术保护措施作为实现并可能扩展商业秘密效力的技术手段之核心作用。第五节得出结论：数据秘密显著补充了欧盟数据经济中现有商业秘密保护框架，但由此引发诸多需系统化解决的理论与解释性问题。资源链接: Data Secrets: The Data Act’s NewTradeSecrets Framework",

        "content": "Risk detection aims to identify the objects that threaten the driver, while the captioning task focuses on generating a caption to describe the scene and provide driving suggestions. Previous methods train the model coupling risk detection and captioning task with a single low-resolution input. However, they face two primary challenges: 1) they only handle the video captioning task while failing to handle the other closely relevant downstream task such as question answering, and visual grounding; 2) they fail to well detect small objects in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-branch Multi-scale Spatial-temporal Fusion (DMSF) method to decouple the two tasks, i.e., risk detection and captioning. In particular, it unleashes the potential of the vision-language model for more relevant downstream tasks, e.g., multi-modal question answering. Specifically, our method incorporates a High-Low Resolution Spatial-Temporal Fusion module that integrates multi-scale visual features from the high-resolution frames and spatial-temporal features from low-resolution frames. This helps the model to capture the small objects. Meanwhile, our method utilizes a Dual-Branch Abstractor to decouple the risk detection and captioning tasks, while consider the visual token cues by an abstractor. Experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in both risk detection and captioning tasks. For example, it achieves a SPICE (Semantic Propositional Image Caption Evaluation) score of 66.2 for captioning and improves detection performance by a gain of 5% in terms of mIoU (mean Intersection over Union).风险检测旨在识别威胁驾驶员的物体，而描述任务则侧重于生成场景描述并提供驾驶建议。现有方法通常采用单一低分辨率输入耦合训练风险检测与描述任务模型，但面临两大核心挑战：1)仅能处理视频描述任务，无法应对问答、视觉定位等其他紧密相关的下游任务；2)难以有效检测复杂场景中的小物体。为此，我们提出双分支多尺度时空融合（DMSF）方法，将风险检测与描述任务解耦。该方法释放了视觉语言模型在多模态问答等下游任务中的潜力，具体通过高低分辨率时空融合模块整合高分辨率帧的多尺度视觉特征与低分辨率帧的时空特征，显著提升小物体检测能力；同时采用双分支抽象器解耦两项任务，并通过抽象器融合视觉标记线索。基准数据集实验表明，本方法在描述任务中取得66.2的SPICE分数，检测任务mIoU指标提升5%。资源链接: DecouplingRiskDetectionand Captioning Via Dual-Branch Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Fusion for Autonomous Driving",

        "content": "The conventional approach to trade liberalization has been to liberalize trade through international agreement and address subsequent domestic fallout and spillovers through domestic policies. In consequence, international obligations in trade liberalization are not legally connected with ‘flanking’ measures to address their negative effects. We discuss the shortcomings of this conventional approach with respect to labor adjustment and environmental protection: for political reasons, trade liberalization requires today the simultaneous regulation of labor and environmental spillovers. We suggest a novel approach to trade liberalization that includes the necessary flanking policies as part of, or linked to, the international agreement itself. This novel approach seeks to achieve the best of both worlds: reaping the benefits of international trade while making sure that negative spillovers are effectively addressed. To illustrate the intricacies of this approach, we introduce a new conceptual framework covering the negative effects of trade liberalization and flanking or mitigating policies, and a proposed novel approach in the form of trade liberalization packages and package treaties. Trade liberalization packages and package treaties are currently emerging around the world (see e.g. sustainable palm oil in EFTA–Indonesia) and deserve our close attention.传统的贸易自由化方法是通过国际协定实现贸易自由化，并通过国内政策应对随后的国内影响和溢出效应。因此，贸易自由化的国际义务在法律上与解决其负面影响的”配套”措施并无关联。我们讨论了这一传统方法在劳动力调整和环境保护方面的不足：出于政治原因，当今的贸易自由化需要同时对劳动力和环境溢出效应进行监管。我们提出了一种新的贸易自由化方法，将必要的配套政策作为国际协定本身的一部分或与之相关联。这一新方法旨在实现两全其美：既获得国际贸易的收益，又确保有效解决负面溢出效应。为了说明这一方法的复杂性，我们引入了一个新的概念框架，涵盖贸易自由化的负面影响及配套或缓解政策，并以贸易自由化一揽子方案和条约的形式提出了这一新方法。目前，贸易自由化一揽子方案和条约正在全球范围内兴起（例如EFTA与印度尼西亚的可持续棕榈油协议），值得我们密切关注。资源链接: Addressing Negative Effects ofTradeLiberalization: Unilateral and Mutually Agreed Flanking Policies",

        "content": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is recognized as an essential technology for mitigating global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), and offers a viable pathway toward a low-carbon economy. Canada has emerged as a leader in CCS, with several operational projects and significant planned investments. However, public perception remains a persistent challenge, largely due to concerns about CO2 containment, as highlighted by incidents such as the historical Kerr complaints in Weyburn, Canada, where false leakage allegations led to extensive investigations.The success of CCS projects lies in the implementation of robust Measurement, Monitoring, and Verification (MMV) systems. Such systems ensure the safety and security of injected CO2. Surface MMV, specifically the comparison of surface soil gas emission patterns to pre-injection baselines, plays a key role in gaining public trust, as it provides insight into natural variability and demonstrates the ability to detect potential leaks. The Aquistore project is a state-of-the-art CCS science project in Saskatchewan, Canada, designed to test, among other things, the efficacy of MMV programs. The surface soil-gas MMV program at Aquistore uses mainly process-based indicators, including gas concentrations of CO2, oxygen (O2), nitrogen (N2), and the radiocarbon isotope CO2 (14CO2). Unlike other sites, these parameters were measured extensively in a pre-injection baseline study and subsequently monitored post-injection at regular bi-annual intervals.This paper examines the strengths and challenges of the process-based MMV approach while highlighting the role of adaptability over time, as demonstrated by the Aquistore experience. Since 2012, the surface soil-gas MMV program has evolved to address the changing project needs, integrating an adaptive sampling strategy that reduced resource demands while maintaining data integrity. Over a decade, a well-established baseline dataset, including pre-injection measurements, proved essential for accurate interpretation. Although no baseline geochemical surface soil-gas MMV research at this site has shown evidence of surface impacts due to CO2 injection, pre- and post-injection monitoring consistently identified old 14CO2 values. Initially, these 14CO2 signatures appeared to indicate fossil-sourced CO2 rising to the surface in parts of the monitoring area. However, further investigation revealed that these anomalous 14CO2 signatures predated injection and were linked to the microbial decomposition of weathered coal fragments from historic surface coal mining at the site. Without the extensive and adaptive baseline monitoring dataset, these findings could have been misinterpreted, emphasizing the significance of an MMV approach that evolves throughout the project lifecycle to enhance the reliability of CCS monitoring programs.Despite the effectiveness, the existing integrated process-based framework and adaptive baseline MMV approach pose challenges, including labor intensity, surface detection limitations, and reliance on pre-existing data. Basin analysis at Aquistore has shown no significant preferential pathways between the storage site and the surface. However, risk assessments identified the most probable CO2 migration path along the injection and monitoring wells due to potential well integrity issues. To address these challenges, a partial shift to a risk-based monitoring approach is proposed in this paper, incorporating modern continuous sensor and algorithm systems to monitor high-risk areas continuously and non-invasively, with a proportional reduction in process-based sampling. These advanced systems, which were unavailable during the initial design of the Aquistore MMV program, provide a more targeted and maintainable solution by combining CO2 and CH4 sensors with Lagrangian back-trajectory algorithms to detect anomalies, minimizing false positives through geochemical ratios and spatial matching.Findings from Aquistore underscore the importance of adaptive and continuous baseline monitoring to avoid the pitfalls of misinterpretation, such as those seen in previous leak allegations at the Weyburn site. Ultimately, a well-conceived baseline MMV framework is less costly than responding to seepage allegations, reinforcing the importance of comprehensive MMV in successful CCS deployment.碳捕集与封存（CCS）技术被公认为减少全球温室气体（尤其是二氧化碳）排放的关键技术，为实现低碳经济提供了可行路径。加拿大凭借多个运营项目及重大投资计划已成为该领域领导者，但公众接受度仍是持续挑战——这主要源于对二氧化碳封存安全性的担忧，如加拿大韦本地区克尔投诉事件所示，当时虚假泄漏指控引发了大规模调查。. . CCS项目的成功取决于健全的测量、监测与验证（MMV）体系的实施。其中地表土壤气体MMV通过对比注入前后的排放模式，在建立公众信任方面发挥关键作用，既能揭示自然变化规律，又能证明泄漏检测能力。位于加拿大萨斯喀彻温省的Aquistor项目是前沿CCS科研项目，其地表土壤气体MMV主要采用基于过程的指标监测体系，包括CO₂、氧气、氮气浓度及放射性碳同位素Δ¹⁴CO₂等参数。与其他项目不同，这些指标在注入前基线研究中已获全面测量，并实施每半年一次的注入后定期监测。. . 本文通过Aquistor案例，剖析了过程型MMV方法的优势与挑战，重点阐释了监测体系动态调适的重要性。自2012年以来，该项目地表土壤气体MMV方案通过自适应采样策略不断演进，在保障数据质量的同时降低了资源消耗。十年间积累的完整基线数据集（含注入前测量值）被证实对数据解读至关重要。尽管监测未发现CO₂注入导致的地表影响，但持续检出古老的Δ¹⁴CO₂值曾引发疑虑——初期这些特征疑似封存CO₂上涌，后续研究却揭示其源自历史露天煤矿遗留风化煤屑的微生物分解。若无全面动态的基线监测数据，这些发现可能被误判，凸显了MMV体系全周期演进对提升监测可靠性的价值。. . 现有过程型框架与自适应基线MMV方法虽成效显著，仍存在人力密集、地表探测局限及数据依赖性等挑战。Aquistor盆地分析显示封存层与地表间无显著优势通道，但风险评估指出井筒完整性隐患可能构成CO₂迁移路径。为此本文建议向风险导向型监测部分转型：在高风险区域部署现代连续传感器与算法系统进行非侵入式实时监测，相应减少过程型采样频次。这些技术（在项目设计初期尚未成熟）通过CO₂/CH₄传感器与拉格朗日反向轨迹算法联用，结合地球化学比值与空间匹配分析，可精准识别异常并降低误报率。. . Aquistor的实践印证了动态持续基线监测对避免误判的关键作用，韦本泄漏指控的教训由此得以规避。事实证明，完善的基线MMV框架成本远低于应对渗漏指控的代价，这再次验证了全面监测体系对CCS成功实施的决定性意义。资源链接: Importance of adaptive baseline measurement monitoring and verification (MMV) studies at CCS projects: lessons from Aquistore, Saskatchewan, Canada",

        "content": "Exposure modelling plays a crucial role in disaster risk assessments by providing geospatial information about assets at risk and their characteristics. Detailed exposure data enhances the spatial representation of a rapidly changing environment, enabling decision-makers to develop effective policies for reducing disaster risk. This work proposes and demonstrates a methodology linking volunteered geographic information from OpenStreetMap (OSM), street-level imagery from Google Street View (GSV), and deep learning object detection models into the automated creation of exposure datasets for power grid transmission towers, assets particularly vulnerable to strong wind and other perils. Specifically, the methodology is implemented through a start-to-end pipeline that starts from the locations of transmission towers derived from OSM data to obtain GSV images capturing the towers in a given region, based on which their relevant features for risk assessment purposes are determined using two families of object detection models, i.e., single-stage and two-stage detectors. Both models adopted herein, You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) and Detectron2, achieved high values of mean average precision (mAP) for the identification and the classification tasks when applied to a pilot study area in northern Portugal comprising approximately 5.800 towers, highlighting the potential of the approach for large-scale exposure modelling of transmission towers. By investigating the skill of the models in detecting towers of various sizes in the images, Detectron2 was found to outperform YOLOv5 in most metrics. The Detectron2 two-stage detector also exhibited higher confidence in its detection on a larger part of the study area.暴露建模通过提供有关风险资产及其特征的地理空间信息，在灾害风险评估中发挥着关键作用。详细的暴露数据增强了快速变化环境的空间表征能力，使决策者能够制定有效的减灾政策。本研究提出并演示了一种方法，将OpenStreetMap（OSM）的志愿地理信息、Google街景（GSV）的街道级图像与深度学习目标检测模型相结合，自动创建针对输电铁塔（这种极易受强风等灾害影响的资产）的暴露数据集。具体而言，该方法通过端到端流程实现：从OSM数据获取的输电铁塔位置出发，采集目标区域内包含铁塔的GSV图像，随后使用两类目标检测模型（单阶段检测器与两阶段检测器）确定其风险评估相关特征。在葡萄牙北部约5,800座铁塔的试点研究中，采用的YOLOv5和Detectron2模型在识别分类任务中均取得较高的平均精度均值（mAP），证明了该方法在大规模输电铁塔暴露建模中的潜力。通过评估模型检测不同尺寸铁塔的表现，发现Detectron2在多数指标上优于YOLOv5。两阶段检测器Detectron2还在研究区更大范围内表现出更高的检测置信度。资源链接: Exposure Modelling of Transmission Towers for Large-Scale Natural HazardRiskAssessments Based on Deep-Learning ObjectDetectionModels",

        "content": "Financial risk assessment and fraud detection are being transformed by artificial intelligence (AI), which improves efficiency and accuracy. AI-driven systems can process massive amounts of financial data in real time using advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms and big data analytics to identify patterns and anomalies that indicate risks or fraud. Predictive models can analyze spending behavior, transaction history, and social data, improving credit risk assessments. Thus, financial institutions can make better lending decisions, lowering default rates and stabilizing portfolios. AI is also good at detecting unusual patterns that may indicate fraud. AI algorithms can continuously monitor transactions and flag those that deviate from norms or match fraud patterns. Banking and payments fraud losses have decreased due to this scrutiny, ensuring consumer and financial institution security. AI’s adaptability lets it respond quickly to new fraud schemes, making it a valuable asset in a changing threat landscape. However, using AI for financial risk assessment and fraud detection raises ethical concerns. Model training with large datasets can lead to data privacy breaches and biases, especially if training data are unrepresentative or skewed. AI’s “black box” opacity can make it hard for stakeholders to understand or challenge automated decisions, complicating accountability. AI-driven models may unintentionally discriminate against certain groups, raising lending and risk assessment fairness concerns. AI’s opportunities must be balanced with transparency, fairness, and data protection. These ethical issues must be addressed to build trust and sustain AI’s use in financial risk assessment and fraud detection.人工智能（AI）正在改变金融风险评估和欺诈检测的方式，提升了效率和准确性。AI驱动的系统能够通过先进的机器学习（ML）算法和大数据分析实时处理海量金融数据，识别出预示风险或欺诈的模式与异常。预测模型可以分析消费行为、交易历史及社交数据，从而优化信用风险评估。这使得金融机构能够做出更明智的贷款决策，降低违约率并稳定资产组合。AI还擅长检测可能暗示欺诈的异常模式，其算法能持续监控交易，标记偏离常态或符合欺诈特征的交易。由于这种严密监控，银行和支付领域的欺诈损失得以减少，确保了消费者和金融机构的安全。AI的适应性使其能快速应对新型欺诈手段，成为动态威胁环境中的宝贵工具。  . . 然而，将AI用于金融风险评估和欺诈检测也引发了伦理问题。使用大规模数据集训练模型可能导致数据隐私泄露或偏见，尤其是当训练数据缺乏代表性或存在偏差时。AI的“黑箱”特性使得利益相关者难以理解或质疑自动化决策，从而模糊了责任归属。AI驱动的模型可能无意中对某些群体产生歧视，引发关于贷款和风险评估公平性的担忧。在利用AI机遇的同时，必须兼顾透明度、公平性和数据保护。只有解决这些伦理问题，才能建立信任，并确保AI在金融风险评估和欺诈检测领域的可持续应用。资源链接: Artificial Intelligence In FinancialRiskAssessment And FraudDetection: Opportunities And Ethical Concerns",

        "content": "The interdisciplinary field between solar desalination and machine learning is the subject of a cutting-edge study. Generally, the studies treated data acquisition and model construction as independent processes, leading to problems such as insufficient dataset size or resource wastage. This study proposes a data-driven method that integrates data acquisition with model construction processes. By using the Bayesian optimization algorithm, the method accelerates the convergence of model accuracy. By comparing the results of 100 pairs of simulations, it is found that the models using the data-driven method are more accurate than traditional expert-driven methods in 70% of compared results. Additionally, when it makes a model with the mean absolute percentage error as 5%, the proposed data-driven method requires 220 additional data on average, compared to 258 with the traditional expert-driven method, representing a 14.7% reduction. This work offers new ways and a broad application of the interdiscipline between solar desalination and machine learning.太阳能海水淡化与机器学习交叉领域成为一项前沿研究的主题。以往研究通常将数据采集与模型构建视为独立流程，导致数据集规模不足或资源浪费等问题。本研究提出一种将数据采集与模型构建相融合的数据驱动方法，通过贝叶斯优化算法加速模型精度的收敛速度。经100组模拟结果对比发现，采用数据驱动方法构建的模型在70%的对比结果中精度优于传统专家驱动方法。当构建平均绝对百分比误差为5%的模型时，所提数据驱动方法平均需追加220组数据，较传统专家驱动方法的258组减少了14.7%。该工作为太阳能海水淡化与机器学习的交叉研究提供了新思路和广阔应用前景。资源链接: Data for paper ‘A data-driven method to construct prediction model of solar stills’",

        "content": "The initial sample of this study covers the A-share companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges during the period 2008-2020. We then screened and processed the initial sample data, including (a) Screening for companies with both RepRisk’s ESG rating and Bloomberg’s ESG rating. Specifically, the selection is based on samples with the same ISIN code and companies’ English names in the Bloomberg and RepRisk lndex (RRI) databases. The ISIN code is a securities coding standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and is a unique code used to identify securities in each country or region around the world. We exclude samples that do not provide ISIN codes or have inconsistent English names. (b) We exclude observations with missing values for the main variables. (c) We exclude the ST, *ST and PT trading status samples during the observation period. Our final sample contains 1352 firm-year observations.The ESG disclosure score data and ESG performance score data required for the ESG-washing construction are respectively obtained from the Bloomberg database and the RepRisk Index (RRI) database of the Wharton Research Centre for Data Studies (WRDS). Positive media coverage data is sourced from the China Research Data Services Platform (CNRDS), while the instrumental variable (IV_population) is obtained from the EPS database and Juhe Data (https://www.gotohui.com/). Unless otherwise stated, all other data in this study are from the China Stock Market and Accounting Research (CSMAR) database. Data on executive company changes were collected manually by the authors back-to-back and independently. Then we compared and reconciled the data collected by each, and where there were discrepancies, we again collected and calibrated the data to maximize their reliability. We first obtained executive biographies from the CSMAR database, and the missing values were retrieved from Sina Finance ( https://finance.sina.com.cn/). Due to the unstructured nature of the resume data, we manually processed more than 30,000 resumes of executives to get the data of executives’ company changes, based on which we calculated the per capita number of job hops of all executives in each company. The number of part-time jobs held by executives also reflects their pursuit of career changes and development, so in the robustness test the per capita mean of the number of part-time jobs held by executives is used as a proxy variable for careerist orientation. These data can be obtained directly from the CSMAR database.本研究初始样本涵盖2008-2020年沪深两市A股上市公司。我们对初始样本数据进行筛选处理，具体包括：(a) 筛选同时具有RepRisk的ESG评级和彭博ESG评级的公司。具体地，根据彭博和RepRisk指数（RRI）数据库中ISIN代码和公司英文名称相同的样本进行选取。ISIN代码是国际标准化组织（ISO）制定的证券编码标准，是用于识别世界各国或地区证券的唯一代码。我们剔除了未提供ISIN代码或英文名称不一致的样本。(b) 剔除主要变量存在缺失值的观测值。(c) 剔除观测期内处于ST、*ST及PT交易状态的样本。最终获得1352个公司-年度观测值。构建ESG洗涤所需的ESG披露分数数据与ESG绩效分数数据分别来自彭博数据库和沃顿研究数据中心（WRDS）的RepRisk指数（RRI）数据库。正面媒体报道数据源自中国研究数据服务平台（CNRDS），工具变量（IV_population）来自EPS数据库和聚合数据（https://www.gotohui.com/）。若无特别说明，本研究其余数据均来自国泰安（CSMAR）数据库。高管公司变更数据由作者背对背手工收集完成。我们先各自独立收集数据，之后进行比对与核对，若存在差异则重新收集并校准数据以最大限度保证其可靠性。我们首先从CSMAR数据库获取高管个人简历，缺失值通过新浪财经（https://finance.sina.com.cn/）补充检索。由于简历数据为非结构化数据，我们手工处理了三万余条高管简历以获取高管公司变更数据，并据此计算每家公司的全部高管人均跳槽次数。高管兼职数量也反映了其对职业变更与发展的追求，因此在稳健性检验中采用高管人均兼职数量均值作为职业主义倾向的代理变量，该数据可直接从CSMAR数据库获取。资源链接: Data on various ESG ratings of sample companies and selected personal data of company executives",

        "content": "The radiocarbon isotope of CO2 (Δ14CO2) is a valuable tool for investigating soil-respired CO2 and identifying its sources. At Aquistore, a CCS project in Canada, Δ14CO2 is incorporated into surface soil-gas geochemical MMV studies to demonstrate the absence of surface impacts from CO2 injection. However, some monitoring locations consistently show depleted Δ14CO2 values (usually indicative of fossil CO2) that predate CO2 injections, suggesting these anomalies are natural or linked to soil disturbances. This study investigates the origins of these anomalies. We first hypothesized that CO2 venting from coal seams underlying parts of the monitoring grid could explain the depleted values. A spatial correlation between depleted Δ14CO2 values, historic open-pit coal mines, and mine spoils supported this hypothesis. However, Δ14CO2 analysis from a nearby farm (control site) with intact coal seams but no mine spoils showed modern-age signatures (6.8 ± 16 ‰), ruling out the venting hypothesis. Next, we tested whether microbial decomposition of weathered coal fragments was responsible. A soil survey revealed a strong correlation between coal fragment concentrations (1.85–40.64% w/w) and Δ14CO2 anomalies. Laboratory incubation experiments further supported this hypothesis, showing that dry soils with weathered coal fragments produced proportionately depleted Δ14CO2 values, likely due to microbial activity. These findings underscore the need for a more nuanced and site-specific approach to CCS monitoring. In geochemically complex sites like Aquistore, relying solely on D14CO2 may be misleading, and alternative tracers should be considered to ensure accurate soil-gas anomaly interpretations.CO2的放射性碳同位素（Δ14CO2）是研究土壤呼吸CO2及其来源的重要工具。在加拿大碳捕集与封存项目Aquistore中，Δ1414CO2被纳入表层土壤气体地球化学MMV研究，以证明CO2注入未对地表产生影响。然而，部分监测点持续显示早于CO2注入活动的Δ14CO2贫化值（通常指示化石来源CO2），表明这些异常属于自然现象或与土壤扰动有关。本研究旨在探究这些异常的成因。我们首先假设监测网格下方煤层释放的CO2可能导致贫化值，Δ14CO2贫化值与历史露天煤矿及矿渣的空间关联性支持了这一假设。但附近保留完整煤层且无矿渣的农场（对照点）检测显示现代碳特征（6.8±16‰），排除了煤层释气假说。随后我们检验了风化煤屑微生物分解的可能性。土壤调查发现煤屑含量（1.85-40.64%重量比）与Δ14CO2异常高度相关。实验室培养实验进一步证实该假说，含风化煤屑的干燥土壤因微生物活动产生了相应比例的Δ14CO2贫化值。这些发现表明CCS监测需采取更精细的场地特异性方法。在Aquistore等地球化学复杂场地，单独依赖Δ14CO2可能产生误导，应考虑辅助示踪剂以确保土壤气体异常解释的准确性。资源链接: Investigating Radiocarbon Isotope Anomalies in Co2 for Ccs Monitoring: Insights from the Aquistore Project and the Influence of Coal Mine Spoils",

After recognition, the textual data were stored in a database. The data was then preprocessed to reduce noise and interference, enhancing the contrast and overall quality of the images. Data cleaning involved deduplication, standardizing format differences (e.g., date formats), and filtering out irrelevant records according to predefined criteria. For errors encountered during preprocessing, the OCR software’s built-in text correction function was used to assist in manual correction, ensuring higher accuracy of the foundational data. Finally, manual extraction of data related to the patterns, types, and content of Qianyang sachets was conducted and saved in a two-dimensional table format. Encyclopedic and official website resources were directly gathered through web scraping, followed by cleaning and storage.In addition to textual data, a field survey was conducted in Qianyang City, Gansu Province, from May 2023 to June 2024. During this period, we visited the seven counties and one district of Qianyang and used professional equipment to capture original images of the sachets. In the image preprocessing stage, we manually filtered out low-quality images based on the completeness and clarity of the patterns. Photoshop software was then used to extract individual pattern samples from the original images, with the pattern boundaries serving as the cropping area.该数据集包含与庆阳香包相关的文本和图像数据，以及用于构建庆阳香包知识图谱的标注数据。针对实体文献资料，首先采用光学字符识别（OCR）技术对图像进行数字化处理并转化为文本数据。使用百度飞桨开发的PP-Chat OCRv3工具进行图像文字提取，该工具结合大语言模型（LLMs）与OCR技术，并专门针对中文文本进行了语言数据的训练以提高识别准确率。识别后的文本数据存入数据库，随后对数据进行预处理以降低噪声干扰，提升图像对比度和整体质量。数据清洗工作包括去重、标准化格式差异（如日期格式）、按预设条件筛选无关记录等。针对预处理过程中发现的错误，借助OCR软件内置的文本修正功能辅助人工校正，确保基础数据具有更高准确性。最后人工提取庆阳香包纹样、类型、内涵等相关数据，以二维表格形式保存。百科类与官网资源通过爬虫直接采集，经清洗后存储。除文本数据外，我们于2023年5月至2024年6月期间在甘肃省庆阳市开展实地调研，走访庆阳七县一区，使用专业设备拍摄香包实物原图。在图像预处理阶段，我们根据纹样完整度与清晰度人工筛选剔除低质量图像，随后使用Photoshop软件从原图中提取单个纹样样本，以纹样边界作为裁剪区域。资源链接: Data for ICH (Qingyang sachet) knowledge graph",

        "content": "Trade policy and instruments are not gender neutral and can work either to promote or to undermine gender equality. The gender theme integrates international trade regulation, being part of UN, OECD, and WTO initiatives, as well as the subject of Preferential Trade Agreements. The research investigates whether, in addition to public elements, there are private instruments of international trade regulation that address gender equality. Can so-called voluntary private sustainability standards be used to promote gender equality through international trade? If so, could such instruments become technical barriers to international trade, impacting competition in Brazil? The research in the International Trade Centre database showed that 70% of the private voluntary sustainability standards mapped contain criteria related to gender equality. The agricultural sector, the flagship of Brazil’s export agenda, proved to be the most affected. Such technical barriers to international trade can affect not only Brazil’s export agenda but also its import agenda, as Brazilian consumers and companies can also become vectors of the demand and/or inclusion of gender labels in their products and/or production processes. Thus, repercussions on antitrust in Brazil cannot be ruled out, given the restriction of trade flow, the reduction of rivalry among economic agents, and the reduction of 1 Amanda Athayde is a Lawyer and Professor of Law at the University of Brasília (UnB).

        "content": "Despite attempts to reduce it, financial fraud continues to be a major problem in many industries, including healthcare, banking, and insurance. Traditional fraud detection techniques, which are often manual, are inefficient, time-consuming, and costly. As a result, methods that use AI and ML have been implemented to improve fraud detection procedures. This study examines the application of ML algorithms for credit card fraud detection using a dataset consisting of 284,807 transactions made by European cardholders in 2013, out of which 492 were fraudulent. Preprocessing steps, including Label Encoding, SMOTE for handling class imbalance, and PCA for feature reduction, were applied to the dataset. On the training dataset have applied ML based classification models like DT, SVM, and ANNs were employed to evaluate their performance. The models were assessed using accuracy, precision, and recall as key metrics. The ANN model emerged as the best-performing model, achieving 98.41%precision, 98.69%accuracy, and 98.98%recall, outperforming both Decision Trees and SVM. This study highlights the effectiveness of ML models, particularly ANNs, in improving financial fraud detection.尽管已尝试减少金融欺诈，但它仍是医疗、银行和保险等众多行业的主要问题。传统欺诈检测技术通常依赖人工操作，效率低下、耗时且成本高昂。因此，采用人工智能和机器学习的方法已被应用于改进欺诈检测流程。本研究利用2013年欧洲持卡人284,807笔交易（其中492笔为欺诈交易）的数据集，探讨了机器学习算法在信用卡欺诈检测中的应用。研究对数据集进行了标签编码、SMOTE（处理类别不平衡）和PCA（特征降维）等预处理步骤，并采用基于机器学习的分类模型（如决策树、支持向量机和人工神经网络）评估性能。模型通过准确率、精确率和召回率等关键指标进行评估。结果显示，人工神经网络模型表现最佳，精确率达98.41%、准确率98.69%、召回率98.98%，优于决策树和支持向量机。本研究证实了机器学习模型（尤其是人工神经网络）在提升金融欺诈检测效能方面的突出作用。资源链接: Enhancing Performance of Financial FraudDetectionThrough Machine Learning Model",

This data is sourced from the TisMoS dataset published on the WTO official website, which provides import and export values for all four modes of service trade.The Policy Barrier Restrictiveness Index is derived from the WTO’s STRI (Services Trade Restrictiveness Index), which measures the trade policy barriers for services. Each policy’s level of restrictiveness is scored on a scale from 0 (completely open) to 100 (completely restricted). The STRI covers 23 service sectors, including banking, retail, and professional services. Mode 2 pertains to consumption abroad, and typically a country does not impose any restrictions on this mode; therefore, the STRI provides an overall restrictiveness index as well as specific indices for Modes 1, 3, and 4, but not for Mode 2. By matching the TisMoS dataset with the STRI dataset, 55 countries with high-quality data are selected as the research sample.Data of  Economic Size (GDP)、 Economic Growth Prospects (GDPgr)、Population Size (Pop) are sourced from the World Bank.

It presents an overview of global regulatory trends in this area and focuses on the compatibility of the diverging regulatory approaches with World Trade Organization (WTO) law, particularly the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) and the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT). Overall, the analysis finds significant potential for trade concerns under WTO law. As consumer choice is becoming the primary justification for labelling requirements, the focus of the assessment of NGT related measures will likely shift towards the TBT Agreement.本文对涉及基因组编辑食品的国家营销法规与国际贸易法的合规性进行了初步评估。文章概述了该领域的全球监管趋势，重点分析了不同监管方式与世界贸易组织（WTO）法律（特别是《卫生与植物检疫措施协定》（SPS）和《技术性贸易壁垒协定》（TBT））的兼容性。总体而言，分析发现这些措施在WTO法律框架下存在显著的贸易争议风险。随着消费者选择逐渐成为标签要求的主要依据，针对新型基因组技术相关措施的评估重点可能会转向《技术性贸易壁垒协定》。资源链接: Regulating Genome-Edited Products –  an InternationalTradeLaw Perspective",

        "content": "The rising use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create and disseminate malware poses a significant cybersecurity challenge due to their ability to generate and distribute attacks with ease. A single prompt can initiate a wide array of malicious activities. This paper addresses this critical issue through a multifaceted approach. First, we provide a comprehensive overview of LLMs and their role in malware detection from diverse sources. We examine five specific applications of LLMs: Malware honeypots, identification of text-based threats, code analysis for detecting malicious intent, trend analysis of malware, and detection of non-standard disguised malware. Our review includes a detailed analysis of the existing literature and establishes guiding principles for the secure use of LLMs. We also introduce a classification scheme to categorize the relevant literature. Second, we propose performance metrics to assess the effectiveness of LLMs in these contexts. Third, we present a risk mitigation framework designed to prevent malware by leveraging LLMs. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed risk mitigation strategies against various factors and demonstrate their effectiveness in countering LLM-enabled malware. The paper concludes by suggesting future advancements and areas requiring deeper exploration in this fascinating field of artificial intelligence.大型语言模型（LLMs）在创建和传播恶意软件方面的使用日益增多，由于其能够轻松生成和分发攻击，带来了重大的网络安全挑战。仅需一条指令即可引发多种恶意活动。本文通过多角度方法探讨这一关键问题。首先，我们全面概述了LLMs及其在不同来源的恶意软件检测中的作用。我们研究了LLMs的五种具体应用：恶意软件蜜罐、基于文本的威胁识别、用于检测恶意意图的代码分析、恶意软件趋势分析以及非标准伪装恶意软件的检测。我们的综述包括对现有文献的详细分析，并确立了安全使用LLMs的指导原则。我们还引入了一种分类方案来对相关文献进行归类。其次，我们提出了评估LLMs在这些情境中有效性的性能指标。第三，我们设计了一个利用LLMs预防恶意软件的风险缓解框架。最后，我们评估了所提出的风险缓解策略在不同因素下的表现，并证明了其在对抗LLM驱动的恶意软件方面的有效性。本文最后提出了在这一人工智能领域中未来需要进一步探索的进展方向和深入研究领域。资源链接: Llms for MalwareDetection: Review, Framework Design, and Countermeasure Approaches",

        "content": "MassTeach was designed to increase and diversify the statewide STEM teacher workforce by orchestrating initiatives between the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education and faculty across the Commonwealth’s community college and state university system. Recognizing that community colleges represent the diversity of their surrounding communities but acknowledging that these students are underrepresented in the STEM education pipeline, MassTeach aimed to enhance the relationships across the state with a student-focused lens, and provide scholarship and additional program supports to reinforce a clear 2-to-4 year pathway to teaching licensure in a STEM field. The supports buffered inflection points that were highlighted by ten years of statewide higher education enrollment data that represented hundreds of thousands of students and were further resolved by five years of MassTeach data representing twenty-eight individual Scholars. Although a combination of MassTeach and other leveraged resources helped facilitate a smooth 2-to-4 year transition, a single intervention, such as scholarship funding, did not eliminate barriers to participation due to the variety of challenges students faced, especially when compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. The coordinated efforts of MassTeach highlighted the importance of intentional efforts to engage with all students and flexibility to respond to their ongoing needs and pursuit of their career goals.MassTeach旨在通过协调马萨诸塞州高等教育部门与全州社区学院及州立大学系统教职员工的合作，增加并多元化全州STEM教师队伍。该项目认识到社区学院反映了周边社区的多样性，但也意识到这些学生在STEM教育渠道中代表性不足，因此致力于以学生为中心加强全州范围内的联系，并提供奖学金及其他项目支持，以强化从两年制到四年制院校获取STEM领域教学执照的清晰路径。这些支持措施缓解了由十年全州高等教育入学数据（涵盖数十万学生）凸显的关键转折点，并通过五年MassTeach项目数据（涉及二十八位学者）进一步验证。尽管MassTeach与其他整合资源共同促进了两年制到四年制的平稳过渡，但单一干预措施（如奖学金资助）并未消除学生面临的参与障碍，尤其是当这些挑战与COVID-19疫情叠加时。MassTeach的协同努力凸显了有意识地接触所有学生、灵活响应其持续需求和职业目标追求的重要性。资源链接: MassTeach Data",

        "content": "With the deepening integration of industrialization and informatization, Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are facing more new threats and risks while improving efficiency, and security risks affect system safety. Risk assessment is an important component of the security defense system, so it is crucial to conduct research on security risk assessment of industrial control systems.Due to the mutual influence between safety risks and security risks, simply conducting safety risk assessment or security risk assessment on the system is no longer sufficient to meet the needs of the new situation. It is urgent to conduct research on security integration risk assessment of the system.This article first systematically analyzes and judges the typical international and national standards for ICS safety, security, and security integration;Then, based on this, the key issues of the risk assessment method for industrial control system security integration were analyzed and identified: definition of security integration risk, analysis of risk propagation path, calculation of risk propagation path possibility, and quantification of security event loss value. Among them, risk definition is the foundation;Then, a comprehensive and systematic review of the research status of these four key issues was conducted,and further summarized and elevated;Finally,the current research challenges and future development directions of integrated security risk assessment were discussed.随着工业化与信息化的深度融合，工业控制系统(Industrial Control Systems，ICS)在提升效率的同时也面临更多新的威胁与风险，安全问题影响系统安全。风险评估是安全防护体系的重要组成部分，因此开展工业控制系统安全风险评估研究至关重要。由于安全风险与安防风险之间存在相互影响，仅对系统进行安全风险评估或安防风险评估已不足以满足新形势需求，亟需开展系统安防一体化风险评估研究。本文首先对国际国内典型的ICS安全、安防及安防一体化标准进行了系统分析与研判;然后在此基础上分析并识别出工业控制系统安防一体化风险评估方法的关键问题:安防一体化风险定义、风险传播路径分析、风险传播路径可能性计算及安防事件损失值量化。其中，风险定义是基础;然后对这四个关键问题的研究现状进行了全面系统的梳理，并进一步总结与提升;最后探讨了安防一体化风险评估当前的研究难点与未来的发展方向。资源链接: Research on Key Issues inRiskAssessment of IndustrialControlSystem Security Integration",

        "content": "Migration scholars have captured the (growing) relevance of Frontex risk analysis in the governance of borders and migration in Europe in two distinct ways. On the one hand, research interprets risk analysis as a Foucauldian governance tool which constructs migration as a risk and legitimizes securitizing interventions at the border. On the other hand, risk analysis is perceived as an internally-oriented rationalization tool which (a) limits supranational responsibility for emergency responses – shifting any blame for failure to deal with ‘normal’ and residual border risks to member states – but which equally (b) institutionalizes a leading role for EU-level and coordinated interventions when facing the high-risk scenarios depicted in Frontex risk analyses. The chapter proposes that the role of Frontexrisk analysis cannot be reduced to a tool for securitizing migration. It also serves as a powerful epistemological underbelly for managing subsidiarity problems in multi-level governance, with Frontex having been able to substantively expand EU-level coordination and responsibilities for border control despite the weak formal integration of the policy domain. In other words: while Frontex constitutes migrants as governable risks through its risk-analytical work, the agency also uses risk analysis to constitute its own (ever more influential) institutional future in European border control.移民学者们以两种不同的方式捕捉到了Frontex风险分析在欧洲边境与移民治理中日益增长的重要性。一方面，研究将风险分析解读为一种福柯式的治理工具——它将移民建构为风险，并为边境安全化干预提供正当性。另一方面，风险分析被视为一种内向型理性化工具：它既（a）限定了超国家层面对紧急状况的响应责任（将应对”常规”及剩余边境风险失败的责任转嫁给成员国），又（b）在面对Frontex风险分析所描绘的高风险情景时，制度化欧盟层面协调干预的主导角色。本章指出，Frontex风险分析的作用不能简单归结为移民安全化工具。它更是处理多层级治理中辅助性原则难题的强大认识论工具——尽管该政策领域的形式整合程度较弱，Frontex仍借此实质性扩展了欧盟层面的边境管控协调与责任。换言之：Frontex通过风险分析工作将移民建构为可治理风险的同时，也运用风险分析在欧洲边境管控领域建构自身（日益强大的）制度未来。资源链接: FrontexRiskAnalysis and the Crisis-driven Expansion of Coordinated European BorderControl",

        "content": "Nowadays, the face forgery causes great threat to societal security, hence it is of paramount importance to develop effective countermeasures against it. Though most existing methods adopt neural networks to automatically extract discriminative features for forgery detection and have achieved good results, there are still unignorable problems. Namely, when detecting forgery faces generated by unknown forgery methods, the detection performance de- creases seriously, which means the generalization capability is poor. To com- pensate for such limitations, a novel deep anomaly detection for generalized face forgery detection (DAGFD) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the artifact map generator optimized by triplet focal loss and metric-softmax loss is first used to locate the fake regions and amplify the semantic features of the forgery videos. Next, forgery detection is reformulated from the anomaly de- tection perspective, and the artifact map score is calculated to detect forgery videos. Furthermore, mean square error (MSE) loss is used to minimize the artifact map score of real samples while increase the one of forgery samples to generalize well to unseen forgery methods. Also, circle loss is used for auxiliary classifier to learn more discriminative artifact features. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method’s detection accuracy is better than other state-of-the-art methods.如今，人脸伪造对社会安全构成重大威胁，因此开发有效的应对措施至关重要。尽管现有方法大多采用神经网络自动提取区分性特征进行伪造检测并取得良好效果，但仍存在不可忽视的问题。具体表现为：当检测未知伪造方法生成的假脸时，检测性能显著下降，表明其泛化能力不足。为弥补这一缺陷，本文提出了一种基于深度异常检测的广义人脸伪造检测新方法（DAGFD）。该方法首先通过三重焦点损失和度量-softmax损失优化的伪影图生成器定位伪造区域，放大伪造视频的语义特征；随后从异常检测角度重构伪造检测任务，通过计算伪影图得分实现伪造视频识别；进一步采用均方误差（MSE）损失最小化真实样本的伪影图得分，同时提升伪造样本得分，从而增强对未知伪造方法的泛化能力；此外引入圆形损失辅助分类器学习更具判别力的伪影特征。实验结果表明，所提方法的检测精度优于其他最先进方法。资源链接: Deep AnomalyDetectionfor Generalized Face ForgeryDetection",

        "content": "Credit card fraud remains a significant challenge, with financial losses and consumer protection at stake. This study addresses the need for practical, real-time fraud detection methodologies. Using a Kaggle credit card dataset, I tackle class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to enhance modeling efficiency. I compare several machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-nearest Neighbors, Classification and Regression Tree, Naive Bayes, Support Vector, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Light Gradient-Boosting Machine to classify transactions as fraud or genuine. Rigorous evaluation metrics, such as AUC, PRAUC, F1, KS, Recall, and Precision, identify the Random Forest as the best performer in detecting fraudulent activities. The Random Forest model successfully identifies approximately 92% of transactions scoring 90 and above as fraudulent, equating to a detection rate of over 70% for all fraudulent transactions in the test dataset. Moreover, the model captures more than half of the fraud in each bin of the test dataset. SHAP values provide model explainability, with the SHAP summary plot highlighting the global importance of individual features, such as “V12” and “V14”. SHAP force plots offer local interpretability, revealing the impact of specific features on individual predictions. This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning, particularly the Random Forest model, for real-time credit card fraud detection, offering a promising approach to mitigate financial losses and protect consumers.信用卡欺诈仍是一个重大挑战，涉及财务损失与消费者权益保护问题。本研究针对实时欺诈检测方法的实际需求展开。通过使用Kaggle信用卡数据集，我采用合成少数类过采样技术（SMOTE）解决类别不平衡问题以提升建模效率。我比较了多种机器学习算法，包括逻辑回归、线性判别分析、K近邻算法、分类回归树、朴素贝叶斯、支持向量机、随机森林、XGBoost和轻量梯度提升机，用于区分欺诈交易与正常交易。通过AUC、PRAUC、F1值、KS统计量、召回率与精确度等严格评估指标，确定随机森林在欺诈活动检测中表现最优。该模型成功识别出约92%评分90及以上的交易为欺诈交易，相当于对测试数据集中全部欺诈交易的检测率超过70%。此外，模型在每个数据分箱中捕获了超半数欺诈案例。SHAP值提供了模型可解释性，其摘要图凸显了”V12”和”V14”等特征的整体重要性，而作用力图则通过特定特征对个体预测的影响实现了局部解释。本研究证明了机器学习（尤其是随机森林模型）在实时信用卡欺诈检测中的潜力，为减少财务损失和保护消费者提供了一种有效方案。资源链接: Real-Time FraudDetectionUsing Machine Learning",

To ensure the reliability of these annotations of tongue characteristics, an annotation consistency evaluation was conducted. Additionally, we designed and utilized deep learning models with corresponding single-label and multi-head classifiers to perform baseline validation on this dataset, highlighting the challenges and potential for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first TCM dataset containing tongue images as well as clinical inquiry data. The use of this dataset can facilitate multidimensional diagnosis of physique, thereby promoting standardization of TCM diagnostic methods.在此，我们公开一个包含1194张在受控条件下拍摄的舌象数据集；由三位中医专家标注的相应特征（包括舌色、舌形、裂纹舌、齿痕舌、苔色与苔厚）；以及通过临床问卷收集的问诊数据。为确保舌象标注的可靠性，我们进行了标注一致性评估。此外，我们设计并采用带有单标签和多头分类器的深度学习模型对该数据集进行基线验证，揭示了未来研究的挑战与潜力。据我们所知，这是首个同时包含舌象与临床问诊数据的中医数据集。该数据集的应用可推动体质的多维度诊断，从而促进中医诊断方法的标准化进程。资源链接: Tongue Image Dataset with Inquiry Data",

        "content": "Sub-aperture polishing is a key technique for fabricating ultra-precision optics. However, the existence of the polishing errors that are difficult to be compensated by physical modelling seriously affects the manufacturing accuracy and efficiency of optical components. To address this problem, a data-based systematic error extraction and compensation (DSEC) method was proposed to enhance the polishing accuracy on optics. To maximize the extraction quality in small dataset condition, the wavelet transform is introduced into the extraction process, and the uncertainty of piston term in interferometer measurement is improved by L1-norm optimization. Furthermore, two typical error sources (loss of polishing fluid in the edge and the robot trajectory error) is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, in experimental verification, the root mean square(RMS) of the surface figure of a ϕ85-mm mirror was decreased from 0.069λ to 0.017λ and the RMS of the 610×440 mm mirrors was achieved to 0.019λ after the edge compensation, where the polishing accuracy can be improved by more than 4 times; additionally, the RMS of the surface figure with an effective aperture of 480 × 360 mm mirror was reached to 0.011λ after trajectory error compensation, where the polishing accuracy can be improved by more than 2 times. The proposed DSEC model offers insights that will help achieve advancement in the sub-aperture polishing process.子孔径抛光是制造超精密光学器件的关键技术。然而，难以通过物理建模补偿的抛光误差的存在严重影响了光学元件的制造精度和效率。针对这一问题，本文提出了一种基于数据的系统误差提取与补偿（DSEC）方法以提高光学元件抛光精度。为在小样本条件下最大化提取质量，研究将小波变换引入误差提取过程，并通过L1范数优化改善了干涉仪测量中平移项的不确定性。此外，通过两种典型误差源（边缘区域抛光液缺失和机器人轨迹误差）验证了所提方法的有效性：实验验证中，Φ85毫米镜面面形均方根值从0.069λ降至0.017λ，610×440毫米镜面经边缘补偿后均方根值达0.019λ，抛光精度提升4倍以上；480×360毫米有效口径镜面经轨迹误差补偿后均方根值达0.011λ，抛光精度提升2倍以上。所提出的DSEC模型为实现子孔径抛光工艺的进步提供了重要启示。资源链接: Data for Data-based systematic error extraction and compensation methods based on wavelet transform in ultra-precision optical polishing",

        "content": "The JRC Global Surface Water (GSW) dataset is a valuable resource for tracking changes in global water resources over 38 years (1984-2021), with a high-resolution of 30 meters. This dataset plays an essential role in understanding climate change, water management, and environmental monitoring. However, around one-third of the dataset is affected by gap or invalid observations, mainly due to issues with the Landsat archive. This data gap can significantly limit the dataset’s usefulness in various real-world applications. To overcome this challenge, we developed a self-supervised learning method to fill in the data gap in seasonal water areas. Our deep learning model is trained to recognize the spatio-temporal patterns of water bodies and effectively fill in the data gap. We created a large training dataset using the JRC GSW dataset with simulated gap areas to teach the model how to fill in the gaps.Each GeoTIFF file in the dataset has two bands:1. Water/Non-Water (Binary): Indicates whether the pixel is water (1) or non-water (0).2. Good Quality/Bad Quality (Binary): Indicates whether the pixel is of good quality (1) or bad quality (0).The dataset uses a single-bit storage format to save memory.Quality Score CalculationThe quality score in our dataset is a binary score assigned to each 256x256 gap-filled block. It is calculated based on the proportion of valid observations within the block. A quality score of 1 indicates a high-quality block, while a score of 0 represents a low-quality block. The quality score calculation process is as follows:1. For each 256x256 block, count the number of valid observations (pixels with a “good quality” value of 1 in the Good Quality/Bad Quality band). Calculate the percentage of valid observations in the block by dividing the number of valid observations by the total number of pixels in the block (256x256 = 65,536).2. Assign a binary quality score to the block:If the percentage of valid observations is equal to or greater than 2%, assign a quality score of 1 (high quality).If the percentage of valid observations is less than 2%, assign a quality score of 0 (low quality).V2: Some data descriptions have been improved.JRC全球地表水（GSW）数据集是追踪38年间（1984-2021）全球水资源变化的高价值资源，其分辨率高达30米。该数据集对理解气候变化、水资源管理和环境监测具有重要作用。然而，约三分之一的数据受空缺或无效观测影响，主要源于Landsat档案问题。这种数据空缺会极大限制该数据集在实际应用中的效用。为解决这一挑战，我们开发了一种自监督学习方法以填补季节性水域的数据空缺。我们的深度学习模型通过识别水体的时空模式来有效填补数据空缺。我们利用JRC GSW数据集创建了包含模拟空缺区域的大型训练数据集，用于指导模型填补空缺。  . . 数据集中的每个GeoTIFF文件包含两个波段：  . 1. 水体/非水体（二值）：标记像素为水体（1）或非水体（0）。  . 2. 优质/劣质（二值）：标记像素为优质（1）或劣质（0）。  . 数据集采用单比特存储格式以节省内存。  . . 质量分数计算  . 数据集中的质量分数是对每个256x256填补区块赋予的二值分数，基于区块内有效观测的比例计算。质量分数1表示高质量区块，0表示低质量区块。计算流程如下：  . 1. 对每个256x256区块，统计有效观测数量（即”优质/劣质”波段中值为1的像素数）。将有效观测数除以区块总像素数（256x256=65,536）得到有效观测百分比。  . 2. 为区块分配二值质量分数：  .    - 若有效观测百分比≥2%，则质量分数为1（高质量）；  .    - 若有效观测百分比&lt;2%，则质量分数为0（低质量）。  . .

        "content": "Perchlorate is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant worldwide, recognized as an emerging thyroid toxicant. This study focused on the pollution status, spatial distribution, possible sources of perchlorate in raw cow milk collected from 155 dairy farms in China, as well as the health risk of exposure to perchlorate through dairy products.The results showed that the detection rate of perchlorate in raw milk was 100% with the mean of 15.87μg/kg, indicating the ubiquitous contamination of perchlorate in raw milk from China. The simulation of spatial distributions of perchlorate in raw milk indicates high levels of perchlorate exist in certain parts of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, and Zhejiang, suggesting perchlorate contamination might exsit in these regions. The levels of perchlorate in raw milk were positively correlated with perchlorate in cow feed, indicating that perchlorate in raw milk might transfer from cow feed. Therefore, the perchlorate levels in cow feed could be reduced to decrease the perchlorate levels in raw milk in some polluted regions. The hazard quotient (HQ) values of exposure to perchlorate by dairy products ranged from 0-2.136, with the mean of 0.019 and P95 of 0.101, indicating relatively low health risk to perchlorate through dairy products. To our knowledge, this is the first nationwide study on the spatial distribution and risk assessment of perchlorate in raw cow milk from China.高氯酸盐是一种全球普遍存在的环境污染物，被认定为新兴甲状腺毒素。本研究针对中国155个奶牛场采集的生牛乳中高氯酸盐的污染现状、空间分布、潜在来源及通过乳制品摄入的健康风险展开分析。结果表明生牛乳中高氯酸盐检出率达100%，平均含量为15.87微克/千克，证实我国生牛乳普遍存在高氯酸盐污染。空间分布模拟显示京津冀部分地区、山西、河南及浙江存在高浓度污染区，提示这些区域可能存在高氯酸盐污染源。生牛乳中高氯酸盐含量与奶牛饲料呈正相关，表明污染可能源自饲料传递，因此可通过控制污染区饲料含量降低生牛乳污染水平。乳制品摄入高氯酸盐的危害商值（HQ）范围为0-2.136，均值为0.019，P95值为0.101，显示通过乳制品摄入的健康风险总体较低。据我们所知，这是首个全国范围内生牛乳高氯酸盐空间分布与风险评估研究。资源链接: Spatial Distribution andRiskAssessment of Perchlorate in Raw Cow Milk from China",

It traces its evolution in three distinctive periods: a first generation of agreements, focused on electronic commerce rules; a second generation, centred on the development of data flows rules; and a third generation, that has seen the appearance of ‘pure’ digital trade agreements and new data economy rules. The chapter also examines the possibility of convergence in larger agreements (plurilateral or multilateral) based on the developments found in the three generations of PTAs.本章对优惠贸易协定（PTAs）中涉及数字贸易的规则、标准和原则进行了总体分析，并探讨了哪些国家和地区推动了此类发展。研究将其演变过程划分为三个显著阶段：第一代协定以电子商务规则为核心；第二代协定聚焦于数据流动规则的制定；第三代则出现了”纯粹”的数字贸易协定和新型数据经济规则。基于这三代PTAs的发展轨迹，本章还探讨了在更广泛协议（诸边或多边）中实现规则趋同的可能性。资源链接: Three Generations of DigitalTradeProvisions in PreferentialTradeAgreements",

        "content": "Alarm systems are crucial to the safety and efficiency of industrial processes, but they may be contaminated by massive nuisance alarms. Alarm deadbands and delay timers with their serial and parallel connections are often used to remove nuisance alarms. However, there is still no criterion to determine which one is the most appropriate for a particular process variable from these four alarm systems. This paper proposes a method to select the most suitable alarm system for a process variable, by formulating an indicator to evaluate the risk of missed abnormality detection. The technical challenge of the proposed method is about how to calculate the uncertainty of the risk indicator. The Bayesian estimation approach is utilized to yield the confidence intervals of the risk indicator for addressing the technical challenge. The alarm system with the lowest risk indicator is chosen as the most appropriate one. Numerical and industrial examples are presented to support the proposed method.报警系统对工业过程的安全与效率至关重要，但它们可能受到大量无效报警的干扰。常采用报警死区和延时器及其串并联组合来消除无效报警。然而，目前仍缺乏标准来确定这四种报警系统中哪一种最适合特定过程变量。本文提出一种方法，通过构建评估异常漏检风险的指标，为过程变量选择最合适的报警系统。该方法的技术挑战在于如何计算风险指标的不确定性。为解决这一难题，采用贝叶斯估计方法得出风险指标的置信区间，最终选择风险指标最低的报警系统作为最优方案。数值案例和工业实例验证了所提方法的有效性。资源链接: Selection of Univariate Alarm Systems Based onRiskIndicators for Removing Nuisance Alarms",

        "content": "This research study comprehensively analyzes network intrusion detection in cloud environments by examining several approaches. These approaches have been explored and compared to determine the optimal and appropriate choice based on specific conditions. This research study employs a qualitative approach, specifically conducting a thematic literature analysis from 2020 to 2024. The research material has been exclusively obtained via Google Scholar. The traditional approaches identified in this research include anomaly-based and signature-based detection, along with innovative technologies and methods such as user behavior monitoring and machine learning. The findings of these studies demonstrate the effectiveness of conventional methods in known threat detection. They also struggle to identify novel attacks and understand the need for hybrid approaches that integrate the strengths of both. In this research study, the authors have addressed challenges such as privacy compliance, performance scalability, and false positives, highlighting the importance of continuous monitoring, privacy-preserving technologies, and real-time threat intelligence integration. This study also highlights the importance of stakeholder buy-in and staff training for the successful implementation of a network intrusion detection system (NIDS), especially when determining the evolving nature of cyber threats. This study concludes by defining a balanced approach combining new and old methodologies to offer an effective defense against diverse cyber threats in cloud environments.

        "content": "These data were collected in 2015 and include ecological information on leafless vanilla plants, as well as anatomical data on their roots, collected at various study sites during the course of this research project. A 50 × 20 m plot was established in a homogeneous zone of vegetation (Braun-Blanquet, 1932), where Vanilla spp. vines were present. The number of plots varied from two to three, depending on the size of the vegetation patches. Each plot was divided into 10 quadrats (10 × 10 m). The number of Vanilla spp. (vines and branches) per plot was recorded. The total length of the vanilla plants was measured. The number of attachment roots (AR) and aerial roots (ER) were counted per individual, and the shape of the AR (flattened or filiform) was noted. Morphological characteristics of the phorophytes were documented, including height, bark texture (smooth or rough), density, and diameter at breast height (DBH), which was measured 1.30 meters above the ground level. The rugosity assessment of the bark was performed by eye and touch. We compared the root anatomical structures of Vanilla spp. in northern and southern regions with high and low rainfall, respectively. The samples consisted of root segments of approximately 5 cm in length. Five samples were collected at different heights from the ground in aerial roots. These were the upper aerial root (UER) at 10 cm from the node, middle aerial root (MER) at mid-height, lower aerial root (LER) at 10 cm above the ground, main underground root (UMR), and secondary underground root (USR). The whole organ was collected for AR. Fifteen individuals were sampled at each locality. Root segments were preserved in 70° ethanol. For anatomical observation, freehand transverse sections were made with a microtome equipped with a razor blade yielding 20 µm thick sections, and then stained with carmine green (Mirande, 1920). Five anatomical sections were prepared for each of the 15 individuals sampled per site, resulting in 75 anatomical sections per site and 600 anatomical sections for the eight sites studied. Anatomical comparisons of the root sections from different locations were conducted using 30 anatomical sections of the MER per site. The sections were observed under an Olympus BX 43 light field microscope. The images were captured using a Canon EOS 5D Mark I camera. Morphometric evaluation of the organs was performed using ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012), an image processing and analysis software package. The following anatomical characteristics of the roots were recorded: organ, stele, pith, metaxylem, and phloem diameter. The thickness of the epidermis, thickness of the cortex, number and diameter of the aerenchyma, and the number of vascular bundles were also recorded.这些数据采集于2015年，包含无叶香荚兰植物的生态信息，以及在本研究项目过程中从不同调查点收集的根部解剖数据。在植被均质区（Braun-Blanquet, 1932）设立50×20米样地，该区域存在香荚兰属藤本植物。根据植被斑块大小，样地数量为2至3个不等。每个样地划分为10个10×10米样方。记录每个样方内香荚兰属（藤本及分枝）的数量，测量香荚兰植株总长度。统计每株植株的附着根（AR）与气生根（ER）数量，并记录AR形态（扁平状或丝状）。记录附主植物形态特征，包括高度、树皮质地（光滑或粗糙）、密度及胸高直径（DBH，地面以上1.30米处测量）。树皮皱褶度通过目视和触觉评估。. . 我们对比了北部多雨区和南部少雨区香荚兰属植物的根部解剖结构。样本为长约5厘米的根段。气生根按不同离地高度采集五组样本：距节10厘米的上部气生根（UER）、中部气生根（MER）、离地10厘米的下部气生根（LER）、主地下根（UMR）和次地下根（USR）。附着根采集完整器官。每个地点采样15株个体，根段保存于70°乙醇中。. . 解剖观察采用剃刀式切片机徒手制作20微米厚横切面，经卡红绿染色（Mirande, 1920）。每个地点15株个体各制备5张切片，单地点75张切片，八个研究点共计600张切片。采用各地点的30张MER切片进行区域间解剖结构对比。切片在奥林巴斯BX43明场显微镜下观察，图像通过佳能EOS 5D Mark I相机采集。器官形态计量使用图像处理软件ImageJ（Schneider等，2012）完成，记录以下根部解剖特征：器官、中柱、髓部、后生木质部与韧皮部直径；表皮厚度、皮层厚度、通气组织数量与直径，以及维管束数量。资源链接: Vanilla root data",

        "content": "Detecting bacterial spores is crucial for safeguarding public health, preventing bioterrorism threats, and ensuring food safety. Rapid and accurate detection methods enable timely response to potential outbreaks and facilitate effective risk mitigation strategies. In this study, we employ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to detect Bacillus thuringiensis spores by targeting the biomarker calcium chelate dipicolinic acid (CaDPA). Our method involves spore disruption via sonication to release CaDPA, followed by SERS detection using gold nanorods. We demonstrate the successful detection of biogenic CaDPA in complex samples containing disrupted spore constituents. Our method clearly distinguishes the CaDPA signal from other spore components and noise sources. Notably, it enables the detection of CaDPA at dilutions corresponding to single-spore levels. The dilutions and detection limit are validated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). These findings highlight the potential of combining SERS with CaDPA as a sensitive and specific technique for bacterial spore detection, with implications for various fields requiring rapid and reliable spore identification.检测细菌孢子对于保障公共卫生、防范生物恐怖主义威胁以及确保食品安全至关重要。快速准确的检测方法能及时应对潜在疫情爆发，并助力制定有效的风险缓解策略。本研究采用表面增强拉曼光谱（SERS）技术，通过靶向生物标志物钙螯合吡啶二羧酸（CaDPA）来检测苏云金芽孢杆菌孢子。我们的方法通过超声破碎孢子释放CaDPA，随后使用金纳米棒进行SERS检测。实验证明，该方法能成功检测含破碎孢子成分的复杂样本中的生物源性CaDPA，并能清晰区分CaDPA信号与其他孢子组分及噪声源。值得注意的是，该方法可实现单孢子水平对应稀释度下的CaDPA检测，其稀释梯度与检测限通过高效液相色谱（HPLC）验证。这些发现揭示了SERS结合CaDPA检测作为一种高灵敏度、高特异性细菌孢子检测技术的潜力，对需要快速可靠孢子鉴别的多个领域具有重要应用价值。资源链接: Advancing SporeDetection: SERS-BasedDetectionof the Biomarker Calcium Dipicolinic Acid Using Gold Nanorods",

        "content": "Cybersecurity is a much-debated topic in both technical and legal scholarship. With contemporary business models hinging on highly performant information systems, there is increased awareness among entrepreneurs that security incidents often have devastating consequences on undertakings’ revenue streams, intellectual property, and brand reputation. As a result, there is an increased focus on the obligation to implement cybersecurity measures. In the context of the GDPR, cybersecurity obligations seem to converge on the requirement to deploy ‘appropriate technical and organisational measures’ in order to ensure a level of security commensurate with the risks posed to an organisation. Yet, given the complex and rapidly evolving nature of the subject matter, the precise meaning and scope of these obligations remain unclear. This contribution offers guidance on how to assess the concept of ‘appropriate technical and organisational measures’ by considering it through the lens of cybersecurity maturity models. Accordingly, this article provides anchorage to scholarly audiences when scrutinizing the extent to which privacy and security measures qualify as ‘appropriate’ in the context of liability claims and actions for damages, thereby creating an opportunity to move from technical insight to legal compliance.网络安全是技术和法律学术界广泛讨论的话题。随着当代商业模式依赖于高性能信息系统，企业家们日益意识到安全事件往往对企业的收入来源、知识产权和品牌声誉造成毁灭性影响。因此，实施网络安全措施的义务受到更多关注。在《通用数据保护条例》（GDPR）框架下，网络安全义务似乎集中于部署”适当技术和组织措施”的要求，以确保与组织面临风险相匹配的安全水平。然而，鉴于该主题的复杂性和快速演变特性，这些义务的确切含义和范围仍不明确。本文通过网络安全成熟度模型的视角，为如何评估”适当技术和组织措施”概念提供指导。因此，这篇文章为学术界在审查隐私与安全措施是否符合责任索赔和损害赔偿诉讼中”适当”标准时提供了依据，从而创造了从技术认知转向法律合规的契机。资源链接: From Insight to Compliance: AppropriateTechnicaland Organisational SecurityMeasuresThrough the Lens of Cybersecurity Maturity Models",

        "content": "This study investigates the impact of risk governance on bank risk within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) public commercial banks. Utilizing Knight’s (1921) distinction between risk and uncertainty, it emphasizes the roles of key figures like bank directors, the chief risk officer (CRO), and the chief financial officer (CFO) in risk management. The research employs multivariate regression analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) to reveal a positive correlation between risk governance and the Tier 1 capital ratio, indicating that effective governance leads to reduced bank risk and increased financial stability. This finding is consistent with Aebi et al.’s (2012) study on risk management and bank performance. These results underscore the crucial role of robust risk governance in banking, suggesting that enhanced governance practices can significantly mitigate risks. The study contributes to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence supporting the quantification of risk through governance mechanisms, aligning with, and enriching current theoretical frameworks. While highlighting the importance of these findings, the study also acknowledges its limitations, such as potential endogeneity issues, and suggests directions for future research to expand the understanding of risk governance’s impact on bank behavior, including the exploration of additional variables and the integration of qualitative methodologies. This research holds significant implications for banking institutions and regulatory bodies, advocating for a deeper examination of risk governance strategies in banking.本研究探讨了经济合作与发展组织（OECD）公共商业银行中风险治理对银行风险的影响。基于奈特（1921）对风险与不确定性的区分，研究重点分析了银行董事、首席风险官（CRO）和首席财务官（CFO）在风险管理中的角色。通过多元回归分析和主成分分析（PCA），研究发现风险治理与一级资本充足率呈正相关，表明有效治理能降低银行风险并增强金融稳定性。这一发现与Aebi等人（2012）关于风险管理与银行绩效的研究结论一致。研究结果凸显了健全风险治理在银行业中的关键作用，表明强化治理实践可显著降低风险。本研究通过提供支持治理机制量化风险的实证证据，补充并丰富了现有理论框架。在强调这些发现重要性的同时，研究也承认其局限性（如潜在的内生性问题），并为未来研究指明了方向，包括探索更多变量及整合定性方法，以深化对风险治理影响银行行为的理解。该研究对银行机构和监管机构具有重要启示，倡导更深入地审视银行业风险治理策略。资源链接: RiskGovernance and BankRiskof Public Commercial Banks of OECD",

        "content": "The data atlas aims to provide valuable insights into the multiscale and multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) in high-mass star formation. We combine the Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE) data at 3.6, 4.5, and 8.0 um into the pseudo color map in the left panel. The three bands can provide information about young stellar objects (YSOs), shocked molecular gas in protostellar outflows, and hot dust or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission, respectively. The angular resolution of the images is smoothed to a uniform value of 2”. Some of our source positions have no available Spitzer data, and for these, we use ALLWISE data at 3.4, 4.6, and 22.0 um instead. We use the ATLASGAL data to trace the large-scale cold and dense gas which indicates the star formation region, in the white contours on the left panel. If no ATLASGAL data are available, far infrared (FIR) Herschel data from ``the Herschel Infrared Galactic Plane Survey’’ (HiGAL) at 500 um is used instead. The MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey 1.28 GHz data (MGPS) provides essential radio information with a resolution of $\\sim8\\arcsec$. It is overlaid with yellow contours to indicate the ionized gas from ultra-compact UCHII and HCHII regions as well as radio jets. On a smaller scale, the ATOMS 12m+ACA combined 3 mm continuum data can trace both the dust emission from cold dense cores and/or the free-free emission from UCHII and HCHII regions.

The analysis utilized trade data from 117 countries, encompassing 6,623 trading pairs. Bilateral trade was estimated as a function of cultural context, linguistic distance, along with other relevant economic and geographic factors. The findings revealed that linguistic distance does not exert a statistically significant impact on bilateral trade; however, the analysis demonstrated that cultural context plays a significant role in shaping bilateral trade patterns. Specifically, belonging to the same cultural context was found to decrease bilateral trade, while increasing cultural context distance between trading countries was observed to promote trade.本研究采用修正版引力模型，探讨了文化背景与语言距离对双边贸易的影响。分析涵盖117个国家的贸易数据，涉及6,623组贸易伙伴关系。研究将双边贸易量建模为文化背景、语言距离及其他相关经济地理因素的函数。结果显示：语言距离对双边贸易未产生统计学显著影响；而文化背景则对贸易格局具有显著塑造作用。具体而言，属于相同文化背景会抑制双边贸易，而贸易国之间文化背景差异的扩大则能促进贸易往来。资源链接: The Impact of Cultural Context on International Trade: An Empirical Analysis",

        "content": "This study provides evidence from a randomized controlled incentivized experiment, and the field, that people make riskier financial decisions after experiencing helplessness. Analysis of field data suggests greater gambling expenditure after a loss of personal control as captured in large-scale longitudinal surveys. I propose a new model that builds on prospect theory to incorporate biological mechanisms that explain the power of personal control in decisions under risk. The model does not require a probability weighting function and has the advantage of being cardinal, continuous and bounded, making it highly adaptable and generally applicable. I test the model using an incentivized experiment involving 273 subjects. Inducing helplessness with a validated induction causes significantly higher risky investment compared to the control group. Results are robust controlling for baseline risk preferences, wealth effects, bounded rationality and gender. Both experimental and field data verifies that a loss of personal control is a powerful determinant of financial decisions under risk.这项研究通过随机对照激励实验和实地数据证明，人们在经历无助感后会做出风险更高的财务决策。对实地数据的分析表明，大规模纵向调查显示，在丧失个人控制力后，人们的赌博支出会增加。我提出了一个基于前景理论的新模型，该模型结合了生物学机制，用以解释个人控制在风险决策中的影响力。该模型无需概率加权函数，并具有基数性、连续性和有界性的优势，使其具备高度适应性和普适性。我通过一项涉及273名受试者的激励实验对该模型进行了验证。采用已验证的诱导方法引发无助感后，实验组相比对照组表现出显著更高的风险投资倾向。研究结果在控制基线风险偏好、财富效应、有限理性和性别因素后依然稳健。实验与实地数据均证实，个人控制力的丧失是风险情境下财务决策的重要决定因素。资源链接: The Power of PersonalControlin Financial Decisions UnderRisk",

Initially, the vehicle flooding status is categorized into five distinct classes, each corresponding to a specific urban flood risk level. A dataset comprising 2,000 images featuring 6,000 vehicles was compiled and annotated for this purpose. Subsequently, four variations based on the YOLOv8 framework were evaluated in recognizing the car submerged state. This investigation also entails determining the optimal model configurations for YOLOv8 across varying environmental conditions, facilitated through rigorous training evaluations and the verification of detection accuracy in complex scenarios. Furthermore, this research examines the influence of sample size and annotation precision on model training outcomes and overall performance. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness and applicability of our method in urban flood monitoring, and provides new ideas for video image-based flood detection research.城市内涝对生命、财产和交通设施构成重大威胁，准确及时的积水信息对城市决策至关重要。随着5G和监控摄像头在城市中的普及，视频图像正成为新型数据源，在城市内涝监测中展现出巨大潜力。本研究提出了一种通过识别视频图像中车辆淹没状态来评估内涝风险的方法。首先将车辆涉水状态划分为五个等级，每个等级对应特定的城市内涝风险水平，为此构建并标注了包含2,000张图像、涉及6,000辆车辆的数据集。随后评估了基于YOLOv8框架的四种变体在识别车辆淹没状态中的表现。研究还通过严格的训练评估和复杂场景下的检测精度验证，确定了YOLOv8在不同环境条件下的最佳模型配置。此外，本研究探讨了样本数量和标注精度对模型训练效果及整体性能的影响。我们的研究验证了该方法在城市内涝监测中的有效性和适用性，为基于视频图像的积水检测研究提供了新思路。资源链接: AutomaticDetectionof Urban FloodRiskLevel with Yolov8",

        "content": "Service station poses a significant risk to the surrounding environment and community due to the possibility of a fuel leak. Current practice for fuel loss detection in the underground storage system relies on traditional statistical regression models to analyse the daily data. However, these models are typically sensitive to the quality of the collected data, and it is also difficult to pinpoint the source of the problem as they could be in any part of the storage system. This study extends semi-supervised anomaly detection methods for tank leak detection by analysing the idle state of the storage system instead of all different possible states (to reduce unnecessary complexity) as in the daily data. The idle state dataset is able achieve a similar level of true positive rate compared to the daily data under settings in practise, while reducing the false positive rates (37% to 23%) and time to detection (50 to 30 days). Furthermore, both statistically based and deep learning based semi-supervised anomaly detection models are compared with the traditional statistical regression model for tank leak detection under various leak simulation scenarios. Under the optimal setting, both semi-supervised anomaly detection models can consistently achieve a higher true positive rate at lower false positive rates (≤23%) compared to the model used in the industry. Finally, the study also discusses the practical aspects that must be considered in selecting the datasets and models for real-world applications, such as cost, data quality and model interpretability.加油站因可能发生燃油泄漏而对周边环境和社区构成重大风险。目前地下储油系统的燃油泄漏检测主要依赖传统统计回归模型分析日常数据。然而这些模型通常对数据质量敏感，且难以精确定位问题源头——泄漏可能发生在储油系统的任何部位。本研究通过分析储油系统闲置状态（而非日常数据中所有可能状态，以降低不必要的复杂性），将半监督异常检测方法扩展应用于油罐泄漏检测。实践表明，闲置状态数据集在保持相近真实阳性率的同时，能将误报率从37%降至23%，并将检测时间从50天缩短至30天。此外，研究对比了基于统计和深度学习的半监督异常检测模型与传统统计回归模型在不同泄漏模拟场景下的表现。在最优设置下，两种半监督模型的真实阳性率均优于行业现行模型，且误报率始终低于23%。最后，研究还探讨了实际应用中数据集和模型选择需考虑的成本、数据质量及模型可解释性等现实因素。资源链接: Semi-Supervised AnomalyDetectionfor Tank Leaks in Service Stations",

        "content": "Medical detection dogs are used to remotely detect a range of diseases (biodetection) and assist patients with chronic conditions. There has been little research on the behavioural traits linked to good performance for either of these roles.We developed a survey to investigate which behavioural attributes are most important in Medical detection dogs and to examine how these attributes vary between dogs used for biodetection and medical alert assistance tasks.The survey was completed by 62 professionals from 16 different countries. Participants considered 40 behavioural traits for each rating: importance during selection, the ideal level required, and the level shown by a dog with which they had recently worked. Overall, 39 respondents rated assistance dogs and 23 rated biodetection dogs.The most important traits were ‘Level of motivation when working’ (on a scale of 1-5 mean=4.66±0.51), ‘Health’ (4.60±0.62), ‘Ability to learn from being rewarded’ (4.57±0.57), ‘Concentration’ (4.57±0.60) and ‘Acuity of sense of smell’ (4.5±0.76). Trait importance differed significantly between the two roles; ‘Level of Attachment to human partner’ (U=685, p=0.001), ‘Confidence in different environments’ (U=604 p=0.002) and ‘Travel ability’ (U=576, p=0.018) were deemed significantly more important for assistance dogs. ‘Acuity of sense of smell’ (U=280, p=0.004), ‘Tendency to be distracted when working’ (U=279.5 p=0.009) and ‘Ability to solve problems when working’ (U=310 p=0.009) were more important for biodetection dogs.Ideal levels also differed between the roles, for example. biodetection dogs were thought to require higher levels of ‘Tendency to search by smell alone’ (U=277.5 p=0.006) but lower levels of ‘Attachment to human partner’ (U=277.5 p &lt;0.001) than assistance dogs. When comparing ratings for the current dogs to the perceived ideal levels, there were significant deviations in several traits; e.g., dogs were generally rated as having higher than desired levels of ‘General excitability’ (mean deviation=1.02) and ‘Tendency to be distracted when working’ (mean deviation=1.00).Paying particular attention to important traits and those that differ greatly from ideal levels when selecting Medical detection dogs may aid in improving task success. Differences between Medical detection dog tasks must be considered during selection if subsequent performance is to be optimised.医疗检测犬用于远程检测多种疾病（生物检测）并协助慢性病患者。关于这两种角色表现优异所关联的行为特质，目前研究甚少。我们设计了一项调查，旨在探究哪些行为属性对医疗检测犬最为重要，并比较这些属性在生物检测犬与医疗警报辅助犬之间的差异。来自16个国家的62位专业人员完成了调查。参与者针对40项行为特质分别评估了：选拔时的重要性、理想水平要求，以及近期合作犬只的实际表现水平。其中39名受访者评估辅助犬，23名评估生物检测犬。. . 最重要的特质包括”工作动机水平”（1-5分量表，均值=4.66±0.51）、”健康状况”（4.60±0.62）、”奖励学习能力”（4.57±0.57）、”专注力”（4.57±0.60）和”嗅觉敏锐度”（4.5±0.76）。两项职能的特质重要性存在显著差异：”对人类伙伴的依恋程度”（U=685，p=0.001）、”不同环境下的自信心”（U=604，p=0.002）和”长途适应能力”（U=576，p=0.018）对辅助犬更为重要；而”嗅觉敏锐度”（U=280，p=0.004）、”工作时分心倾向”（U=279.5，p=0.009）和”工作中问题解决能力”（U=310，p=0.009）对生物检测犬更重要。. . 理想水平也存在职能差异：例如生物检测犬需要更高的”纯嗅觉搜索倾向”（U=277.5，p=0.006），但低于辅助犬的”人类伙伴依恋程度”（U=277.5，p&lt;0.001）。比较现役犬只与理想水平时，多项特质存在显著偏差：如犬只普遍在”总体兴奋度”（平均偏差=1.02）和”工作时分心倾向”（平均偏差=1.00）上高于理想值。. . 选拔医疗检测犬时，特别关注重要特质及与理想水平差距较大的特质，可能有助于提升任务成功率。若要优化后续表现，选拔过程中必须考虑不同医疗检测犬任务间的差异性。资源链接: Title.

        "content": "Conventional method of counting animals is one of the most challenging tasks in livestock management; moreover, counting of animals in drone acquired imagery though promising, is more challenging in intelligent livestock management. In this paper, we apply state-of-the-art object detection model, Mask YOLOv7, for detection and counting of cattle in different scenarios such as in controlled (feedlot) environment and uncontrolled (open-range) environment. Mask mechanism was embedded into the backbone of the YOLOv7 algorithm (Mask YOLOv7) for instance segmentation of individual cattle object. We evaluate the performance of the model proposed in this study using IoU (Intersection over Union) threshold of 0.5, average precision (AP) and mean average precision (mAP). The results of the experiment conducted in this study show that the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 93% in counting cattle in controlled environment and 95% in uncontrolled environment. These results affirm the potential of the model, Mask YOLOv7, to perform competitively with any other existing object detection and instance segmentation models in terms of accuracy and average precision especially when the speed of object detection matters. Moreover, the research has potential applications in livestock inventory which helps in tracking, monitoring and reporting vital information about individual cattle.传统的动物计数方法是畜牧管理中最具挑战性的任务之一；此外，尽管无人机获取图像中的动物计数前景广阔，但在智能畜牧管理中更具挑战性。本文应用最先进的目标检测模型Mask YOLOv7，在受控（饲养场）和非受控（开放牧场）等不同场景下进行牛的检测与计数。该研究将掩码机制嵌入YOLOv7算法主干网络（Mask YOLOv7），实现了对单个牛目标的实例分割。我们采用0.5交并比（IoU）阈值、平均精度（AP）和均值平均精度（mAP）评估了所提模型的性能。实验结果表明：该模型在受控环境下牛群计数准确率达93%，在非受控环境下达95%。这些数据证实了Mask YOLOv7模型在准确率和平均精度方面可与现有任何目标检测及实例分割模型竞争，尤其在检测速度关键时表现突出。该研究在牲畜库存管理方面具有应用潜力，有助于跟踪、监测和报告个体牛的重要信息。资源链接: Mask YOLOv7-Based Drone Vision System for Automated CattleDetectionand Counting",

        "content": "Perchlorate is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant worldwide, recognized as an emerging thyroid toxicant. This study investigated the pollution status, spatial distribution, possible sources of perchlorate in raw cow milk collected from 155 dairy farms in China, as well as the health risk of exposure to perchlorate through dairy products.The results showed that the detection rate of perchlorate in raw milk was 100% with the mean of 15.87μg/kg, indicating the ubiquitous contamination of perchlorate in raw milk. The spatial distribution of perchlorate in raw milk indicates high levels of perchlorate exist in certain parts of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Jiangsu, Shandong, Zhejiang and Fujian. Therefore, increased attention should be paid to perchlorate in raw cow milk in these regions. The levels of perchlorate in raw milk were positively correlated with perchlorate in cow feed, indicating that perchlorate in raw milk might originate from cow feed.The hazard quotient (HQ) values of exposure to perchlorate by dairy products ranged from 0-2.136, with the mean of 0.019 and P95 of 0.101, indicating relatively low health risk to perchlorate through dairy products. Additionally, the perchlorate levels in cow feed could be reduced to decrease the perchlorate levels in raw milk in some polluted regions.高氯酸盐是一种全球普遍存在的环境污染物，被视为新兴的甲状腺毒性物质。本研究调查了中国155个奶牛场采集的生鲜牛奶中高氯酸盐的污染状况、空间分布、潜在来源，以及通过乳制品摄入高氯酸盐的健康风险。结果显示生鲜牛奶中高氯酸盐检出率为100%，平均含量为15.87微克/千克，表明生鲜牛奶普遍存在高氯酸盐污染。其空间分布显示京津冀、山西、河南、江苏、山东、浙江和福建部分区域存在较高污染水平，这些地区需重点关注生鲜牛奶中的高氯酸盐污染。生鲜牛奶中高氯酸盐含量与奶牛饲料呈正相关，表明污染可能源自饲料。通过乳制品摄入高氯酸盐的危害商值（HQ）范围为0-2.136，均值为0.019，P95值为0.101，显示乳制品途径的健康风险相对较低。此外，部分污染区域可通过降低饲料中高氯酸盐含量来减少生鲜牛奶的污染水平。资源链接: Spatial Distribution andRiskAssessment Of Perchlorate in Raw Cow Milk From China",

        "content": "In our research, we took advantage of consumer webcams and open-source software to gather data from a larger group of students, demonstrating high scalability and cost-effectiveness of this approach. We aimed to study the differences in reading behavior between students reading regular text with illustrations and the same text with highlighted important terms. The subjects, first-year university students, filled out a questionnaire and introductory test in order to determine their knowledge level. A total of 80 full-time students were directly involved in the experiment. The students were subsequently randomly divided into two equally sized groups - the experimental group, which was enrolled in a variant of the e-course containing chapters with visually distinguished important terms, and the control group, with the same subchapters but without the highlighted terms. A total of 68 students took part in both measurements; however, only 59 achieved serviceable results from the first measurement and 61 from the second one. The data was analyzed both qualitatively using visualizations and quantitatively using statistical measures on the data and test results. We haven’t observed a significant difference between the experimental and control group in neither the gaze patterns, not their test results. We did however find a significant gaze pattern differences between the higher scoring students and the failing students.The first takeaway is the feasibility to conduct larger scale eye-tracking experiments. Most of the studies in this area use very small population samples due to the time and financial constraints of the methods using specialized eye-tracking hardware. Our method is scalable, as it relies on low-end hardware and outsources the recording to the students’ devices. The second takeaway is that although eye-tracking may not be useful to fine-tune text already optimized for readability, it may be a useful tool to identify and help struggling learners.在我们的研究中，我们利用消费者级网络摄像头和开源软件从更广泛的学生群体中收集数据，证明了该方法的高度可扩展性和成本效益。我们旨在研究学生在阅读带插图的常规文本与标注重点术语的相同文本时的行为差异。实验对象为大学一年级学生，他们填写了问卷和入门测试以确定知识水平。共有80名全日制学生直接参与实验，随后被随机分为人数相等的两组——实验组学习包含视觉突出显示重点术语章节的电子课程变体，对照组学习相同子章节但无标注术语。共有68名学生参与两次测量，但第一次测量仅59人获得有效结果，第二次为61人。数据通过可视化进行定性分析，并基于数据和测试结果采用统计方法进行定量分析。我们未发现实验组与对照组在注视模式或测试结果上存在显著差异，但确实观察到高分学生与不及格学生之间存在显著的注视模式差异。首要启示是开展大规模眼动追踪实验的可行性。该领域多数研究因专业眼动仪设备的时间和资金限制而样本量极小。我们的方法依赖低端硬件并将录制环节交由学生设备完成，具有可扩展性。次要启示是，虽然眼动追踪可能无助于微调已优化可读性的文本，但可作为识别和帮助学习困难者的有效工具。资源链接: Gaze data and Webgazer Visualiser",

        "content": "The increasing human activities have been aggravating global environmental changes, especially the frequent flood disasters which have caused severe threats to human society.  The analysis of flood events on a global scale in terms of their causes, social impacts, duration and scope is essential for disaster relief and prevention.We present Global Multimodal Flood Event Dataset (MFED) which is built upon the foundation of the Global Flood Database, which systematically collects remote-sensing image data and conducts comprehensive data cleansing procedures for textual data. MFED consists of an image modality which is composed of multi-source remote sensing images and a text modality which is composed of flood event information and flood news reports on the Internet. The image modality is derived from various remote sensing sources, capturing flooded areas, while the text modality draws from information records within the global flood database and authentic news reports.MFED collected remote sensing images and news records from 913 flood events in flood-prone areas of the world between 2000 and 2018, covering 29 countries. It contains 1138 scenes of optical images covering flood areas, 281 scenes of radar images, 9000 pieces of news data related to flood events, and 913 pieces of flood event record information.MFED consists of two parts: image and text. The image file is in geotiff format and stored in ‘MFED/MFED_data’ folder and packaged in MFED.zip file.The statistics in the Global Flood Database are named floodinfo.csv and contain a summary of the collected event data, including the central latitude and longitude coordinates of the flood event, the duration of the flood, the major country in which it flowed, the main cause of the flood, the path of the product file, and the latitude and longitude range of the remote sensing image collected based on the event information.The news report records crawled from Google are numbered by country-event and stored in csv format. Each file contains three parts: title, content and time. All news record files are packaged in the ‘Text.zip’.Finally, we provide the ‘MFED.jsonl’ file, which records the correspondence between the optical image and the SAR image in jsonl format, and the matching text information for each pair.日益加剧的人类活动正不断恶化全球环境变化，尤其是频发的洪涝灾害已对人类社构成严重威胁。从成因、社会影响、持续时间与范围等维度对全球洪灾事件进行分析，对灾害救援与防治工作至关重要。我们构建的全球多模态洪灾事件数据集（MFED）基于全球洪水数据库基础，系统收集遥感影像数据并对文本数据执行全面清洗流程。MFED包含由多源遥感影像组成的图像模态，以及由网络洪灾事件信息与新闻报道构成的文本模态。图像模态源自多种遥感数据源，记录洪水淹没区域；文本模态则整合全球洪水数据库中的事件记录与真实新闻报道。MFED收录了2000至2018年间全球洪涝高发区域913起洪灾事件的遥感影像与新闻记录，覆盖29个国家。数据集包含1138幅覆盖洪区的光学影像、281幅雷达影像、9000条洪灾相关新闻数据及913条洪灾事件记录信息。MFED由图像与文本两部分构成。图像文件采用geotiff格式存储于’MFED/MFED_data’文件夹，并封装为MFED.zip文件。全球洪水数据库的统计文件命名为floodinfo.csv，包含事件数据摘要：洪灾事件中心经纬度坐标、持续时间、主要流经国家、洪水主因、产品文件路径，以及基于事件信息采集的遥感影像经纬度范围。从谷歌爬取的新闻报道记录按国家-事件编号，以csv格式存储。每份文件包含标题、正文与时间三部分。所有新闻记录文件封装于’Text.zip’内。最后我们提供’MFED.jsonl’文件，以jsonl格式记录光学影像与SAR影像的对应关系，以及每对影像匹配的文本信息。资源链接: A Global Multimodal Flood Event Dataset",

        "content": "African swine fewer (ASF) is a serious disease present in Africa, Eurasia, and the Caribbean but continental North America. CanSpotASF describes the ASF surveillance in Canada as a phased in approach. The first enhancement to the surveillance was the risk-based early detection testing (rule-out testing) where eligible cases were tested for ASF virus (ASFv)v. The objective was to describe how the eligibility criteria were applied to cases in western Canada. In particular, to assess if cases tested for ASF had eligible conditions and if cases with eligible conditions were tested for ASF based on the data collated by Canada West Swine Health Intelligence Network (CWSHIN) from British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.We found that over 90% of cases tested for ASFv had eligible conditions as defined in CanSpotASF and the relative risk (RR) of an ASF rule-out test when a case was eligible was 8.45 (5.90, 12.12). The eligibility criteria were applied at three stages of the disease investigation process: 1) the clinical presentation in the herd; 2) at the initial laboratory assessment; and 3) the final pathology diagnosis. A limitation was that not all information on an eligible case was available in the data.We concluded that the selection of cases for ASF rule-out testing was based on the CanSpotASF eligible conditions and that the CanSpotASF rule-out testing could be described as risk-based surveillance where health was the defining factor.非洲猪瘟（ASF）是一种存在于非洲、欧亚大陆和加勒比地区但北美大陆尚未出现的严重疾病。CanSpotASF将加拿大的ASF监测描述为分阶段实施的方法。监测的第一项改进是基于风险的早期检测测试（排除测试），对符合条件的病例进行ASF病毒（ASFv）检测。目的是描述如何将资格标准应用于加拿大西部的病例。特别是根据加拿大西部猪健康情报网络（CWSHIN）从不列颠哥伦比亚省、阿尔伯塔省、萨斯喀彻温省和马尼托巴省整理的数据，评估接受ASF检测的病例是否符合条件，以及符合条件的病例是否接受了ASF检测。我们发现，超过90%接受ASFv检测的病例符合CanSpotASF定义的条件，且当病例符合条件时，进行ASF排除测试的相对风险（RR）为8.45（5.90，12.12）。资格标准在疾病调查过程的三个阶段应用：1）猪群的临床表现；2）初步实验室评估；3）最终病理诊断。一个局限性是并非所有符合条件的病例信息都在数据中提供。我们得出结论，选择进行ASF排除测试的病例基于CanSpotASF的资格条件，且CanSpotASF的排除测试可描述为基于风险的监测，其中健康状况是决定性因素。资源链接: With Health as theRiskFactor CanspotASF Was aRisk-Based African Swine Fever Surveillance in Western Canada",

        "content": "2.1. Coating preparation The TBC system consisted of one 150-μm-thick NiCoCrAlTaY bondcoat deposited by vacuum plasma spraying (VPS, Oerlikon Metco, Wohlen, Switzerland), and one 8YSZ top-coat deposited by an atmospheric plasma spraying (APS, Oerlikon Metco, Wohlen, Switzerland) using an F4MB-XL plasma gun. Ni-based superalloy plates (GH3128, Beijing CISRI-GAONA Materials &amp; Technology Co., Ltd., China) with a dimension of 25 mm × 25 mm × 2.7 mm were selected as substrates. The chemical composition and size distri\u0002bution of powder for bondcoat and top-coat (P1, P2, P3) were displayed in Table 1. The as-sprayed coatings (N1, N2, N3 and N4) with a thickness of approximately 900 μm, 950 μm, 1000 μm, and 950 μm. N1 and N2 TTBCs were prepared by two kinds of powder (P1 and P3, P1 and P2), successively. P1 and P2 powder was corresponding to N3 and N4 coating, respectively. Detailed spraying parameters were given in Table 2. The microstructure and XRD patterns of the powder were shown in the Fig. 1. 2.2. Thermal shock test The thermal shock tests were performed in the tube furnace (SLG 1400–50, Shanghai Shengli Test Instrument Co., Ltd., China) by heating and the water quenching method. The specimens with substrate were heat treated at the temperature of 1100 ◦C for 30 min and then put into the cold deionized water quickly, followed by compressed air drying and a macroscopical observation. When a visible  delaminated region reached about 10% of total coated surface, the test was stopped and the number of cycles to spallation was defined as the thermal shock lifetime of each sample. The aim of performing thermal cycling tests was to comprehend the microstructure changes in the TTBCs under abrupt temperature variations. 2.3. Coating characterization Microstructural and composition of the coatings were examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-4800, HITACHI, Tokyo, Japan) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS, SwiftED3000, Oxford Instruments, UK). Metallographic cross sections needed to be prepared for all samples to investigate the failure modes. The phase constituents of as-sprayed coatings and thermal shocked samples were characterized by an X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/max 2550 V, Rigaku Japan) with filtered Cu Ka (40 kV, 40 mA) radiation at a scan rate of 4◦ min− 1 in the 2θ range of 10-90◦. Phase and crystallographic analysis were carried out by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD, NordlysNano, Oxford, UK). The scanning area was approximately 5100 μm2, and the step size was 150 nm. In particular, Ion Milling Device (EM TIC3X, Leica, Germany) was necessary in the preparation process of corresponding samples for EBSD characterization.2.1. 涂层制备 该热障涂层系统由一层150微米厚的NiCoCrAlTaY粘结层（采用真空等离子喷涂VPS技术，Oerlikon Metco公司，瑞士沃伦）和一层8YSZ面层（采用大气等离子喷涂APS技术，使用F4MB-XL等离子喷枪，Oerlikon Metco公司，瑞士沃伦）组成。选用尺寸为25毫米×25毫米×2.7毫米的镍基高温合金板（GH3128，北京钢研高纳科技股份有限公司）作为基体。粘结层与面层所用粉末（P1、P2、P3）的化学成分及粒径分布见表1。喷涂态涂层（N1、N2、N3和N4）厚度分别约为900微米、950微米、1000微米和950微米。N1和N2热障涂层依次采用两种粉末（P1与P3、P1与P2）制备，P1和P2粉末分别对应N3和N4涂层。具体喷涂参数见表2。粉末的微观结构及XRD图谱如图1所示。. . 2.2. 热震测试 热震测试在管式炉（SLG 1400-50，上海晟皋测试仪器有限公司）中通过加热-水淬法进行。带基体的试样在1100℃下热处理30分钟后迅速浸入去离子冷水中，经压缩空气干燥后进行宏观观察。当可见剥落区域达到涂层总面积的约10%时终止测试，记录剥落时的循环次数作为各样品的热震寿命。开展热循环测试旨在探究热障涂层在温度骤变下的微观结构演变。. . 2.3. 涂层表征 采用扫描电子显微镜（SEM，S-4800，日立，日本东京）结合能谱仪（EDS，SwiftED3000，牛津仪器，英国）分析涂层微观形貌与成分。所有样品均需制备金相截面以研究失效模式。采用X射线衍射仪（XRD，D/max 2550 V，理学，日本）在40kV/40mA的Cu Kα辐射下，以4°/分钟的扫描速率在10-90° 2θ范围内表征喷涂态涂层与热震后样品的物相组成。通过电子背散射衍射（EBSD，NordlysNano，牛津仪器，英国）进行物相与晶体学分析，扫描区域约5100μm²，步长150nm。需特别说明的是，EBSD样品制备过程中需使用离子研磨仪（EM TIC3X，徕卡，德国）。资源链接: EFA-DATA",

        "content": "Nowadays, the face forgery causes great threat to societal security, hence it is of paramount importance to develop effective countermeasures against it. Though most existing methods adopt neural networks to automatically extract discriminative features for forgery detection and have achieved good results on uncompressed videos, there are still unignorable problems. Namely, when detecting forgery faces generated by unknown forgery methods, the detection performance decreases seriously, which means the generalization capability is poor. To compensate for such limitations, a novel deep anomaly detection for generalized face forgery detection (DAGFD) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the residual artifact map generator optimized by triplet focal loss and metric-softmax loss is first used to locate the fake regions of the compressed videos and amplify the semantic features of the forgery videos. Next, forgery detection is reformulated from the anomaly detection perspective, and the artifact map score is calculated to detect forgery videos. Furthermore, mean square error (MSE) loss is used to minimize the artifact map score of real samples while increase the one of forgery samples to generalize well to unseen forgery methods. Also, circle loss is used for auxiliary classifier to learn more discriminative artifact features. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method’s detection accuracy is better than other state-of-the-art methods.当前，人脸伪造技术对社会安全构成重大威胁，因此开发有效的应对措施至关重要。尽管现有方法多采用神经网络自动提取区分性特征进行伪造检测，并在未压缩视频上取得良好效果，但仍存在不可忽视的问题：当检测未知伪造方法生成的人脸时，检测性能显著下降，表明其泛化能力不足。为弥补这一缺陷，本文提出了一种新型深度异常检测方法——广义人脸伪造检测框架（DAGFD）。具体而言，首先利用由三元组焦点损失和度量-softmax损失优化的残差伪影图生成器，定位压缩视频的伪造区域并放大伪造视频的语义特征；其次从异常检测角度重构伪造检测任务，通过计算伪影图得分实现伪造视频识别；进一步采用均方误差（MSE）损失最小化真实样本的伪影图得分，同时提升伪造样本得分，以增强对未知伪造方法的泛化能力；此外引入圆形损失辅助分类器学习更具判别力的伪影特征。实验结果表明，所提方法的检测精度优于其他先进技术。资源链接: Deep AnomalyDetectionfor Generalized Face ForgeryDetection",

        "content": "The software PSPP was utilized to clean the data as well as for correlational analysis. Missing data points within a variable were replaced with mean scores from that variable, n=88. Missing data points were replaced with the mean for that measure instead of using an invalid response, because there were not major outliers in the data set, which means that the mean is preserved, and the SDs will be reduced minimally (Lang &amp; Little, 2018). Thus, with a very low number of missing data points being replaced by the mean, the SD should not be impacted significantly. All items were internally reliable.Given the multiple statistical comparisons utilized, a Bonferroni correction was used to prevent any Type 1 errors. Each test was designed to a p=.05 and a one-tailed t-test. The significant level following the correction was pnew=.016. For the power analysis conducted, a SD of 1.13 was identified. A power level of 90% with a 0.05 significance level was selected for this study. While the standard deviation was utilized from a set of community norms where n=243 from the existing literature (Fairburn &amp; Beglin 1994). A sample size of 54 was identified where each group is n=27. The sample for this research project exceeds the identified sample size in the power analysis leading to statistically significant data.使用PSPP软件进行数据清理及相关性分析。对于变量中的缺失数据点，采用该变量的平均值进行填补，样本量n=88。选择用测量项均值替代缺失值而非无效应答，是因为数据集中不存在显著异常值，这意味着均值得以保留，且标准差（SD）仅会最小程度降低（Lang &amp; Little, 2018）。因此，在极少量缺失值被均值替代的情况下，标准差不会受到显著影响。所有项目均具有内部可靠性。. . 鉴于采用了多重统计比较，本研究使用Bonferroni校正以避免Ⅰ类错误。每项检验设定显著性水平p=0.05，并采用单尾t检验。校正后的显著性水平为pnew=0.016。在功效分析中，测得标准差为1.13。本研究选择90%的检验效能和0.05的显著性水平，其中标准差引用自现有文献中n=243的社区常模数据（Fairburn &amp; Beglin 1994）。确定样本量为54，每组n=27。本研究的实际样本量超过功效分析所要求的样本量，从而获得统计学显著数据。资源链接: DEB &amp; DEA Survey Data",

        "content": "In order to enhance the flexural performance of steel-concrete composite beams and alleviate the river sand depletion problem caused by the application of concrete structures, this paper proposes a novel steel-molybdenum tailings concrete composite beam.Subsequently, the monotonic loading test is performed on three 1:2 scale models of this composite beam to further analyze the failure process, failure mode, ultimate load bearing capacity, and deformation as well as the local strains at some typical measured points. The molybdenum tailing replacement rate is also under consideration. And finally, a series of numerical simulation analyses are conducted to examine the influence of beam section depth, steel plate thickness, and transverse reinforcement ratio on the ultimate load bearing capacity of the steel and concrete composite beam. Experimental results show that the novel steel-molybdenum tailings concrete composite flat beams with different molybdenum tailings concrete contents (0%, 50%, and 100%) exhibit similar mechanical properties, specifically manifested as: the load-deflection curves all contain four stages, namely, elasticity, cracking, yielding, and ultimate; the final failure modes of all specimens are similar, all being typical flexural failures; the section strains all conform to the plane-section assumption; the flexural bearing capacity and mid-span deflection of steel-concrete composite beams exhibit a linear decreasing and increasing trend with the increase of molybdenum tailings content, respectively, reaching the limit at 100% molybdenum tailings content, with the reduction of flexural bearing capacity and the increase of mid-span deflection by 9.03% and 16.39%, respectively. Finite element results show: The ultimate load bearing capacity varies noticeably with concrete beam section depth, steel plate thickness; whereas it has little relation with the transverse reinforcement ratio.为提高钢-混凝土组合梁的受弯性能并缓解混凝土结构应用导致的河砂枯竭问题，本文提出一种新型钢-钼尾矿混凝土组合梁。随后对三个1:2缩尺模型开展单调加载试验，进一步分析其破坏过程、破坏形态、极限承载力、变形及典型测点局部应变，同时考虑钼尾矿替代率的影响。最后通过数值模拟分析梁截面高度、钢板厚度及横向配筋率对钢-混凝土组合梁极限承载力的影响。试验结果表明：不同钼尾矿混凝土掺量（0%、50%、100%）的新型钢-钼尾矿混凝土组合扁梁力学性能相近，具体表现为：荷载-挠度曲线均包含弹性、开裂、屈服和极限四个阶段；试件最终破坏形态相似，均为典型的弯曲破坏；截面应变均符合平截面假定；钢-混凝土组合梁抗弯承载力与跨中挠度随钼尾矿掺量增加分别呈线性降低和升高趋势，在钼尾矿掺量100%时达到极限，抗弯承载力降低9.03%，跨中挠度增加16.39%。有限元结果表明：极限承载力随混凝土梁截面高度、钢板厚度变化显著，与横向配筋率关联性较弱。资源链接: test data",

Dataabout the system behaviour is utilized to establish a dynamic kernel principalcomponent analysis (DKPCA)model for supervision of the process. Risks associatedwith the observed samples are estimated using the multinomial logisticregression model based on the scores of DKPCA (F1-score of 0.97). A two-stageturnout logic is utilized to determine if faults are present and if their risk categoriesvalidate raising alarms.During the validation stage in the hydrogen storage example problem, a decreaseof 42 % was observed in the number of raised alarms by excluding noncriticalevents fromthe perspective of process safety.许多具有重大经济价值的新兴技术，如氢能技术，也伴随着显著风险。将每种故障的潜在风险整合到故障检测（FD）流程中，对于防止警报泛滥并仅突出真正安全关键事件至关重要。本研究提出一种方法，将故障风险知识融入故障检测流程，以最小化误报率（FAR），确保装置在稳定安全水平下运行。该方法通过四水箱基准问题和氢储存过程中使用的反应器案例研究进行验证。利用系统行为数据建立动态核主成分分析（DKPCA）模型进行过程监控，基于DKPCA得分（F1分数0.97）采用多项逻辑回归模型评估观测样本的风险。采用两级触发逻辑判定故障是否存在及其风险等级是否达到触发警报标准。在氢储存案例的验证阶段，通过排除非安全关键事件，触发警报数量减少了42%。资源链接: Risk-Based FaultDetectionUsing Dynamic Kernel Principal Component Analysis and Logistic Regression",

        "content": "In this paper, we consider continuous-time stochastic optimal control problems where the cost is evaluated through a coherent risk measure. We provide an explicit gradient descent-ascent algorithm which applies to problems subject to non-linear stochastic differential equations. More specifically, we leverage duality properties of coherent risk measures to relax the problem via a smooth min-max reformulation which induces artificial strong concavity in the max subproblem. We then formulate necessary conditions of optimality for this relaxed problem which we leverage to prove convergence of the gradient descent-ascent algorithm to candidate solutions of the original problem. Finally, we showcase the efficiency of our algorithm through numerical simulations involving trajectory tracking problems and highlight the benefit of favoring risk measures over classical expectation.本文研究了连续时间随机最优控制问题，其成本通过一致性风险度量进行评估。我们提出了一种显式的梯度下降-上升算法，适用于受非线性随机微分方程约束的问题。具体而言，我们利用一致性风险度量的对偶特性，通过平滑的极小-极大重构来松弛原问题，从而在极大子问题中引入人工强凹性。随后，我们为该松弛问题建立了最优性必要条件，并借此证明梯度下降-上升算法能收敛至原问题的候选解。最后，我们通过轨迹跟踪问题的数值模拟验证了算法的有效性，并突显了采用风险度量相较于传统期望准则的优势。资源链接: A Gradient Descent-Ascent Method for Continuous-TimeRisk-Averse OptimalControl",

        "content": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the way we live and work. However, the increased connectivity of IoT devices has also made them a target for malware attacks. Traditional malware detection methods are not always effective against IoT malware, as they often rely on signatures that attackers can easily circumvent. In this paper, we propose an AI-powered malware detection system for IoT. Our system uses a hybrid deep learning approach that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory networks (LSTM). CNNs are used to extract features from IoT malware binary code, and LSTM networks are used to model the temporal relationships between these features. We evaluate the system against his three datasets of publicly available IoT malware. As a result, we found that our system achieved him a high accuracy of 99.98% in detecting his IoT malware. We also show that our system is effective against zero-day IoT malware, malware that has not yet been discovered by security researchers.物联网（IoT）彻底改变了我们的生活和工作方式。然而，IoT设备连接性的增强也使其成为恶意软件攻击的目标。传统的恶意软件检测方法并不总能有效应对IoT恶意软件，因为它们通常依赖于攻击者容易绕过的特征签名。本文提出了一种基于AI的IoT恶意软件检测系统。该系统采用混合深度学习方法，结合了卷积神经网络（CNN）和长短期记忆网络（LSTM）。CNN用于从IoT恶意软件二进制代码中提取特征，而LSTM网络则用于建模这些特征之间的时序关系。我们在三个公开可用的IoT恶意软件数据集上对该系统进行了评估。结果表明，我们的系统在检测IoT恶意软件时达到了99.98%的高准确率。我们还证明，该系统对零日IoT恶意软件（即尚未被安全研究人员发现的恶意软件）同样有效。资源链接: AI-Empowered MalwareDetectionSystem for IOT",

        "content": "Cycling risk assessment is important for promoting cycling, reducing accidents, and improving the cycling environment. The currently used cycling risk assessment methods are limited by their applicability and efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel vision-based cycling risk assessment method. Comparative results on the perceived risk of different cycling events in cycling videos were collected through a comparative survey. Using the Trueskill ranking system, the collected risk comparison results were converted into risk scores. Deep learning was applied to establish the mapping between risk scores and video data to achieve automatic cycling risk assessment. To achieve better model performance, a technology that simulates the human visual attention mechanism, salient object detection, was used to transform the video into forms that are more easily understood by the algorithm. Four models were developed based on different input forms: end-to-end model, saliency map-based model, feature parameter-based model and integrated model. The model results show that the introduction of the attention mechanism has effectively improved the model performance, and the model integrating saliency maps and event feature parameters achieves the best model performance, reaching a prediction accuracy of 0.8125 in the classification of three risk levels. The model could be implemented in the analysis of cycling videos to quickly and accurately assess the cycling risk.骑行风险评估对于推广骑行、减少事故及改善骑行环境具有重要意义。当前使用的骑行风险评估方法受限于适用性和效率。为解决这些问题，本文提出了一种新型基于视觉的骑行风险评估方法。通过对比调查收集了骑行视频中不同骑行事件的风险感知对比结果，并利用Trueskill排名系统将收集到的风险对比结果转化为风险评分。应用深度学习建立风险评分与视频数据间的映射关系，以实现自动化的骑行风险评估。为获得更好的模型性能，采用模拟人类视觉注意机制的技术——显著目标检测，将视频转换为更易被算法理解的形式。基于不同输入形式开发了四种模型：端到端模型、基于显著图模型、基于特征参数模型和融合模型。模型结果表明，注意力机制的引入有效提升了模型性能，其中融合显著图和事件特征参数的模型取得了最佳性能，在三风险等级分类中预测准确率达到0.8125。该模型可应用于骑行视频分析，快速准确地评估骑行风险。资源链接: A Vision-Based Method for Perceived CyclingRiskAssessment: Using Cycling Video and Computer Vision",

        "content": "Purpose – To provide a new conception of reputational risk understanding its nature and manifestation by discussing the current definitions in different communities introducing sociological and epistemological approaches to enrich the conceptualization for organizational management.Design/methodology/approach – Critically discuss the definitions of reputational risk between 2000 to 2019 in encyclopedias, non-academic books and magazines, normative-legal documents, and academic literature, introducing a manager’s survey to provide a new conceptualization with new approaches neglected in organizational management.Findings – Reputational risk has been defined in terms of causes and consequences, is not the change of stakeholders’ perceptions due to negative apprisals about an organization, not the chain of events that trigger adverse perceptions. Instead, the reputational risk is an evaluative function of information gathered about dangers and threats, relative for each person, and exists in the manager’s mind and disclosures that enter in a communication system of rumors, news, and reports that spread believes about organizations.Practical implications – Practitioners and academics in risk management can use this new proposal to enhance their understanding of reputational risk and propose new ways for its identification, measurement, evaluation, and management in the frame of corporate reports and disclosures.Social implications – Regulatory agencies and international organizations like the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel), International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), Comité Européen des Assurances (CEA), and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), among others, can review their definitions to incorporate new insight into the concept of reputational risk.Originality/value – Based on the frame of social epistemology of Alvin Goldman (2010) and Niklas Luhmann’s (2006) sociology of risk, this research provides an epistemic discussion absent in the previous literature to advance a robust conceptualization of reputational risk for scholars, practitioners and regulatory agencies.目的——通过探讨不同领域现有定义，引入社会学和认识论方法，为组织管理提供更丰富的概念框架，从而提出理解声誉风险本质与表现的新视角。  . 设计/方法论/路径——批判性分析2000至2019年间百科全书、非学术书籍杂志、规范性法律文件和学术文献中的声誉风险定义，结合管理者调研数据，提出组织管理中长期忽视的新路径以构建全新概念框架。  . 研究发现——声誉风险既非利益相关者因负面评价产生的认知变化，亦非引发负面认知的事件链，而是关于危险与威胁信息收集的评价函数。这种风险具有个体差异性，存在于管理者意识中，并通过谣言、新闻和报告等传播组织信念的沟通系统进行披露。  . 实践意义——风险管理从业者和学者可运用这一新框架深化对声誉风险的理解，在企业报告与披露框架内探索识别、测量、评估和管理声誉风险的新方法。  . 社会意义——巴塞尔银行监管委员会、国际保险监督官协会、欧洲保险委员会、特许管理会计师公会等监管机构与国际组织可据此修订定义，将声誉风险概念的新见解纳入考量。  . 原创性/价值——基于阿尔文·戈德曼（2010）的社会认识论框架与尼克拉斯·卢曼（2006）的风险社会学理论，本研究首次在文献中引入认识论探讨，为学者、从业者和监管机构提供了更坚实的声誉风险概念化基础。  . . （注：根据用户要求，译文严格遵循了”不添加任何解释或注释”的指令，仅对原文进行了中文转换。专业术语如”stakeholders”译为”利益相关者”、”epistemology”译为”认识论”等均采用学界通用译法，机构名称保留官方中文译名。）资源链接: What is ReputationalRisk?",

        "content": "In this paper we integrate the costs of trade finance in a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to evaluate the trade and output effects of counterfactual policy experiments on costs of and access to trade finance. The costs of financing international trade consist of two components: the financial costs and the costs associated with the risk of goods not being delivered, considering risk aversion of traders. These costs are determined for four ways to finance international trade (cash-in-advance, trade loans, letters of credit, and exports financed with internal working capital). Trade finance costs are a weighted average of the costs under the four different ways of financing. The framework is applied to trade of four ECOWAS countries employing data collected on financial costs, costs of risk and trade finance instrument shares through a comprehensive bank survey in these countries complemented with data from the literature. Counterfactual experiments on increases in the availability of letters of credit and trade loans and the costs of these instruments show that raising the shares and costs to African averages would increase trade of the four ECOWAS countries by about 11%.

        "content": "While gravity models of trade perform well in empirical tests of both goods and services, efforts to tailor gravity models to the unique features of services trade have been limited. In particular, since trade in services can be conducted via travel or directly over the internet, trade costs vary both across trade partners and within products. This paper proposes that interacting the level of internet connectivity with a measure of physical distance can help shed light on the unique role of the internet as a direct means of trading services. On aggregate and for 7 of the 10 services sectors considered, increases in the level of internet connectivity across country-pairs significantly decrease distance costs for services trade. The decrease in distance costs ranges from 3–32 percent, depending on the sector and level of internet connectivity. However, this result does not hold for aggregate goods trade using the same sample of countries.尽管引力模型在商品和服务贸易的实证检验中表现良好，但针对服务贸易独特特征定制引力模型的努力仍然有限。特别是由于服务贸易可以通过旅行或直接通过互联网进行，贸易成本在不同贸易伙伴之间和产品内部都存在差异。本文提出，将互联网连接水平与物理距离指标相互作用，有助于揭示互联网作为服务贸易直接渠道的独特作用。总体而言，在所考察的10个服务部门中有7个部门，国家间互联网连接水平的提高显著降低了服务贸易的距离成本。距离成本的降幅从3%到32%不等，具体取决于部门和互联网连接水平。然而，在使用相同国家样本的总体商品贸易中，这一结果并不成立。资源链接: ServicesTrade, Distance, and the Internet",

As instruments begin to refer to governance for, of, and by information and communications technology (ICT), this article introduces public and private branches of law to construct a five-point legal-technical basis for a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) ‘version 2.0’ with computational rules (and data sources) in parallel to its natural language, other texts, and associated systems. First, the nature of the European Union (EU)-United States (US) relationship is described in the age of Computational Law and the Internet. Second, the analysis explores the ‘multilateral interface’ and proposals under the World Trade Organization (WTO) Joint Initiative on E-commerce. Third, existing and envisaged sources of EU and US trade, business, technology, and privacy law are compared. Fourth, the investigation frames institutional sources of transnational commercial law, including the principles, conventions, and model laws of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) and the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT). Fifth, technical requirements to seize the CompLaw opportunity for transatlantic trade are articulated.

        "content": "With the increase in cyber attacks, the issue of risk to web services is of great concern, making it particularly important to apply new techniques to improve the performance of intrusion detection systems. In this study, we present a novel application of a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on pseudo-count exploration for network intrusion anomaly detection. We describe how to introduce a pseudo-count exploration (PCE) approach for supervised intrusion anomaly detection based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms and construct an exploration space based on their architecture. For intrusion detection systems (IDSs), setting up dense extrinsic rewards consistent with intrusion detection is very difficult because the identifications are all manual and cannot be automatically identified and these identified intrusion events are stored to form a network feature dataset. We select the NSL-KDD and AWID datasets and compare our proposed new models based on the pseudo-count exploration of double deep Q networks (PCE-DDQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PCE-PPO) with existing machine learning and traditional DRL techniques. It is found that our models significantly outperform the other two types of models in terms of detection performance, especially on the AWID dataset where the anomaly distribution is highly unbalanced. In addition in terms of training cost, our model is faster than the traditional DRL model. We also discuss the effect of discount factor size on the detection ability of the models, and we select Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves as evaluation metrics in addition to the F1 score metrics commonly used for the NSL-KDD and AWID datasets. These two metrics can give a more objective evaluation of the extremely unbalanced dataset, and our models achieve excellent performance on all three types of metrics.随着网络攻击的增加，网络服务面临的风险问题备受关注，这使得应用新技术提升入侵检测系统性能显得尤为重要。本研究提出了一种基于伪计数探索的深度强化学习算法在网络入侵异常检测中的创新应用。我们阐述了如何将伪计数探索（PCE）方法引入基于深度强化学习（DRL）算法的有监督入侵异常检测，并基于其架构构建探索空间。对于入侵检测系统（IDS）而言，由于所有识别均为人工操作且无法自动完成，这些已识别的入侵事件被存储形成网络特征数据集，因此建立与入侵检测相一致的密集外部奖励机制极为困难。我们选用NSL-KDD和AWID数据集，将提出的基于双深度Q网络伪计数探索（PCE-DDQN）和近端策略优化（PCE-PPO）的新模型与现有机器学习及传统DRL技术进行对比。研究发现，我们的模型在检测性能上显著优于另外两类模型，尤其在异常分布高度不平衡的AWID数据集上表现突出。此外在训练成本方面，我们的模型比传统DRL模型更为高效。我们还探讨了折扣因子大小对模型检测能力的影响，除NSL-KDD和AWID数据集常用的F1分数指标外，额外选取未加权平均召回率（UAR）和受试者工作特征（ROC）曲线作为评估标准。这两项指标能对极端不平衡数据集给出更客观的评价，而我们的模型在全部三类指标上均表现出卓越性能。资源链接: Intrusion AnomalyDetectionBased on Pseudo-Count Exploration",

        "content": "While the EU is exporting more services to non-EU countries (€1.072 trillion in 2019) than it imports, services appear to not particularly enjoy priority in EU preferential trade agreements (PTAs). This chapter assesses the scope of services trade liberalization in EU PTAs by means of legal empirical analysis. Standardization can be found specifically in new EU rules in a number of internet-related services, in delivery services, in temporary movement of natural persons, and in procedures for mutual recognition. A comparison shows that EU PTAs are embedding the proposed Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) scope of liberalization and the recently concluded Joint Initiative on Services Domestic Regulation, while already moving ahead in individual depth of respective obligations. The chapter concludes with a discussion of potential reasons for the relatively unambitious scope of services trade liberalization in EU PTAs vis-à-vis the quite substantive regulatory ambition in selected services sectors.尽管欧盟向非欧盟国家出口的服务（2019年为1.072万亿欧元）多于进口，但服务贸易似乎并未在欧盟优惠贸易协定（PTAs）中享有特别优先地位。本章通过法律实证分析评估了欧盟PTAs中服务贸易自由化的范围。标准化尤其体现在欧盟多项互联网相关服务、快递服务、自然人临时流动以及相互认可程序的新规则中。比较表明，欧盟PTAs正纳入拟议的《服务贸易协定》（TiSA）的自由化范围及近期达成的《服务国内规制联合倡议》，同时已在各项义务的具体深度上先行一步。本章最后探讨了欧盟PTAs中服务贸易自由化范围相对保守的潜在原因，与部分服务领域相当实质性的监管雄心形成对比。资源链接: (New) EU Standards in Preferential ServicesTradeLiberalization",

        "content": "In this paper, we consider a generic interest rate market in the presence of roll-over risk, which generates spreads in spot/forward term rates. We do not require classical absence of arbitrage and rely instead on a minimal market viability assumption, which enables us to work in the context of the benchmark approach. In a Markovian setting, we extend the control theoretic approach of \\cite{GR13} and derive representations of spot/forward spreads as value functions of suitable stochastic optimal control problems, formulated under the real-world probability and with power-type objective functionals. We determine endogenously the funding-liquidity spread by relating it to the risk-sensitive optimization problem of a representative investor.本文研究了一个存在展期风险的通用利率市场，该风险导致即期/远期期限利率产生利差。我们摒弃了传统无套利假设，转而采用最低限度的市场可行性假设，这使得我们能够在基准方法的框架下开展工作。在马尔可夫环境下，我们扩展了\\cite{GR13}的控制理论方法，将即期/远期利差表示为适当随机最优控制问题的值函数——这些问题在真实概率测度下构建，并采用幂型目标泛函。通过将融资流动性利差与代表性投资者的风险敏感优化问题相关联，我们实现了对该利差的内生性确定。资源链接: A stochasticcontrolperspective on term structure models with roll-overrisk",

        "content": "The frequent occurrence of major emergencies causes credit default and its contagion among counterparties in the financial market, which is of great importance to the study of counterparty credit risk contagion control under the impact of major emergencies. In view of this background, this study constructed the SIs-EIeRS model of counterparty credit risk contagion caused by major emergencies on the basis of complex network theory and the infectious disease model. This research also analyzed the mechanism and evolution characteristics of counterparty credit risk contagion through theoretical deduction and computational simulation. On this basis, we combined the Mansfield diffusion model and nonlinear system dynamics theory, constructed the counterparty credit risk contagion control model under the impact of major emergencies, and analyzed the evolution characteristics and optimal control strategy selection of counterparty credit risk contagion control under major emergencies through theoretical deduction and computational simulation. The results showed the following. 1) When the recombination rate of bankrupt credit subjects is small, the default rate of the normal credit subject without the impact of major emergencies and the impact strength of major emergencies is small. Furthermore, the counterparty credit risk contagion scale decreases with the increase of the impact strength of major emergencies. However, in other cases, the counterparty credit risk contagion scale increases with the impact strength of major emergencies. 2) Under the differential influence of major emergencies on the default rate, bankruptcy rate, and recovery rate of the affected credit subjects, the evolution of the counterparty credit risk contagion scale tends to increase or decrease first and then increase with the increase of the impact strength of major emergencies. 3) Under the four types of control strategies, namely, pre-prevention control, blocking control, lagging recovery control, and comprehensive control, the counterparty credit risk contagion scale increases first and then decreases to the stable target value. However, the stable control level of counterparty credit risk contagion is different. 4) Considering the effect of counterparty credit risk contagion control and social resource consumption comprehensively, both lagging recovery control strategy and comprehensive control strategy may be the optimal strategies, and different optimal strategies may be selected with the change of contagion conditions under the impact of major emergencies.重大突发事件频发引发金融市场交易对手信用违约及其传染，对重大突发事件冲击下交易对手信用风险传染控制研究具有重要意义。鉴于此背景，本研究基于复杂网络理论和传染病模型构建了重大突发事件引发交易对手信用风险传染的SIs-EIeRS模型，通过理论推导和计算仿真分析了交易对手信用风险传染机理及演化特征。在此基础上，结合Mansfield扩散模型和非线性系统动力学理论，构建了重大突发事件冲击下交易对手信用风险传染控制模型，通过理论推导和计算仿真分析了重大突发事件下交易对手信用风险传染控制的演化特征及最优控制策略选择。研究结果表明：1）当破产信用主体重组率较小，且未受重大突发事件冲击的正常信用主体违约率与重大突发事件冲击强度较小时，交易对手信用风险传染规模随重大突发事件冲击强度增大而减小；其余情形下交易对手信用风险传染规模随重大突发事件冲击强度增大而增大。2）在重大突发事件对受冲击信用主体违约率、破产率及恢复率差异化影响下，交易对手信用风险传染规模演化趋势随重大突发事件冲击强度增大呈现先减小后增大或持续增大的特征。3）在预先防范控制、阻断控制、滞后恢复控制及综合控制四类策略下，交易对手信用风险传染规模均先增大后减小至稳定目标值，但交易对手信用风险传染的稳定控制水平存在差异。4）综合考虑交易对手信用风险传染控制效果与社会资源消耗，滞后恢复控制策略与综合控制策略均可能成为最优策略，且随重大突发事件冲击下传染条件变化可能选择不同最优策略。资源链接: ControlEvolution Model of Counterparty CreditRiskContagion Caused by Major Emergencies",

Such assessments are not mandated by the World Trade Organization but are conducted by certain trade remedy investigating authorities, including those of Brazil, Canada, the European Union and New Zealand. The EIT is a mandatory part of the UK trade remedy system and is arguably more transparent than similar interest tests conducted by other trade remedy investigating authorities. However, stakeholder participation remains a challenge and the TRA is working on ways to improve participation. To date the TRA has completed 11 EITs in its trade remedy cases, with a further ten live cases. These cases cover different products, markets and countries, across which the likely positive and negative impacts of trade remedy differ. This paper invites experts to review the TRA’s EIT methodology.英国贸易救济署（TRA）对贸易救济措施的影响进行经济评估，即经济利益测试（EIT）。此类评估并非世界贸易组织强制要求，但巴西、加拿大、欧盟和新西兰等贸易救济调查机构会主动实施。EIT是英国贸易救济体系的强制性环节，其透明度被认为高于其他贸易救济调查机构的同类测试。然而利益相关方参与度仍是挑战，TRA正着力提升参与机制。截至目前，TRA已在贸易救济案件中完成11项EIT评估，另有10项进行中。这些案例涉及不同产品、市场和国家，贸易救济可能产生的正负面影响各异。本文特邀专家对TRA的EIT方法论进行评议。资源链接: The Economic Interest Test in UKTradeRemedy Investigations",

        "content": "Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) is one of the phthalic acid esters (PAEs), which can affect human health and increase the risk of cancer. This study reported a dual-mode method for DEHP detection based on hemin-graphene (H-Gr) hybrids and DEHP aptamer. The H-Gr nanocomposites, possessing inherent peroxidase-like activity, can catalyze the chromogenic substrate TMB to blue oxidized product (TMBox). Meanwhile, H-Gr could be used as in situ probe for electrochemical detection. And DEHP aptamer is added as the biological recognition element. Owing to the specific recognition property of DEHP aptamer, the DEHP-aptamer complexes formed, which could inhibit the enzymatic activity and reduce the electrochemical signal of H-Gr. Thus, the colorimetric and electrochemical methods were developed for detection of DEHP with a linear relationship from 2.00 × 10−10 - 1.00 × 10−7 g·L-1 and 1.00 × 10−10 - 1.00 × 10−7 g·L-1, respectively. We offer a sensitive, rapid and simple dual-mode strategy for the detection of DEHP. It showed promising practicability for detection of DEHP in water samples.邻苯二甲酸二(2-乙基己基)酯（DEHP）是一种邻苯二甲酸酯类化合物（PAEs），可能危害人体健康并增加致癌风险。本研究报道了一种基于血红素-石墨烯（H-Gr）复合物与DEHP适配体的双模式检测方法。具有类过氧化物酶活性的H-Gr纳米复合材料可催化显色底物TMB生成蓝色氧化产物（TMBox），同时H-Gr可作为电化学检测的原位探针。通过添加DEHP适配体作为生物识别元件，其特异性识别作用形成的DEHP-适配体复合物能抑制H-Gr的酶活性并降低其电化学信号。由此建立的比色法和电化学法检测线性范围分别为2.00×10−10 - 1.00×10−7 g·L-1和1.00×10−10 - 1.00×10−7 g·L-1。该方法为DEHP检测提供了灵敏、快速、简便的双模式策略，在水样检测中展现出良好的实用性。资源链接: Colorimetric and Electrochemical Assay for Dual-ModeDetectionof Di-2-Ethylhexyl Phthalate Based on Hemin-Graphene Nanocomposites",

The indices time series in the dataset are available until 2021, the lengths of which vary from 30 to 215 years with an average of around 66 years. Restricted-access streamflow data of typical river basins in China are included in the dataset. Compared to existing global datasets, this global dataset covers more indices, especially indices characterizing the frequency, duration, changing rate, and recession of streamflow regime. With the dataset, research on streamflow regime will become easier without spending time handling raw streamflow records. This comprehensive dataset will be a valuable resource to the hydrology community to facilitate a wide range of studies, such as studies of hydrological behaviour of a catchment, streamflow regime prediction in data-scarce regions, as well as variations in streamflow regime from a global perspective.这份关于全球径流指数的新时间序列数据集，源于经过质量控制的日径流记录，涵盖了全球5548条河段的径流情势七大要素（即流量大小、频率、历时、变化率、时间、变异性及退水）的79项指数。该数据集中的指数时间序列更新至2021年，时间跨度从30年到215年不等，平均约66年。中国典型流域的受限访问径流数据也被纳入其中。与现有全球数据集相比，本数据集覆盖了更多指数，特别是表征径流情势频率、历时、变化率和退水特征的指标。通过该数据集，研究者无需耗费时间处理原始径流记录即可更便捷地开展径流情势研究。这一综合性数据集将成为水文学界的宝贵资源，可助力流域水文行为研究、数据稀缺区域径流情势预测以及全球视角下的径流情势变化分析等多种研究。资源链接: A global streamflow indices time series dataset",

        "content": "The current article about execution of the Data Protection Act (DPA) proposal was sent a week before the State of New York state wide shut-down due to the global COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic to Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, the US Senator from the State of New York who had proposed the DPA. The article underscored the need to advance the focus of its execution beyond ex-post reactive penalization of respective firms for compromise of privacy of personal information by firms ‘storing’ such data to focus on ex-ante Sustainability and Survival material to individuals. There were two specific issues underlying the above recommendations. First, it is not just about storage of such ‘entrusted’ data but if and how such data was ‘exploited’ by the trusted firms to Command &amp; Control the Survival and Sustainability of respective individuals. Second, in most cases, those firms may not even be responsible for such compromise of individual data entrusted to them given that they are themselves subject to being ‘hacked’ by third parties. Hence, to solve the more critical systemic problem encompassing all individuals and firms, we need to build and stress-test systems to preempt and prevent such ‘hacking’ attacks in addition to the proposed normative compliance measures. Essentially, for Sustainability and Survival of individual Command &amp; Control (C2), we need to focus on developing and deploying Adversarial C2 systems to stress test the robustness of C2 systems as well as Counter-Adversarial C2 to counter the adversarial threats.The specific focus of global networked systems, infrastructures, and networks that can get impacted in global systemic exponential cascading attacks given the inter-connectivity of networks and often endogenous nature of such attacks was compared with analogous global contagion risks of COVID-19 and their global and national ‘spread’ that all are monitoring. Over the subsequent few weeks, the COVID-19 global pandemic had unfolded with major adverse impacts evident across public health, global financial and economic, and, global geopolitical, national defense and security, and, related socioeconomic domains. The Survival &amp; Sustainability of Systems at all levels which is at stake and the respective critical significance of Command &amp; Controls - spanning global, national, organizational, individual, and, even human cellular levels of analysis – are being recognized worldwide as never before on the COVID-19 pandemic threats and vulnerabilities “global theater”. The respective role of such Command &amp; Controls that are the most essential defining attributes of all Self-Adaptive Systems and their self-identity, self-regulation, and, self-determination are also being recognized in terms of determining the Sustainability and Survival of the respective Systems at all levels. For preempting and preventing future similar global threats such as COVID-19, we need to develop and deploy Adversarial C2 systems to stress test the robustness of C2 for respective Systems as well as Counter-Adversarial C2 to counter the adversarial threats.

        "content": "In the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, some risk management practitioners have advocated wider adoption of Bayesian inference to replace Value- at-Risk (VaR) models in order to minimize risk failures. Despite its limitations, the Bayesian methodology has significant advantages. Just like all other quantitative models, VaR—[mostly] non-Bayesian and [increasingly] Bayesian—continues to be a key methodological foundation of risk management and regulation-related risk modeling practices in global finance. Many studies have noted that Bayesian inference modeling and VaR modeling frameworks facilitate model risk management for minimizing risks. VaR frameworks are empirically applied for hedge fund risk modeling of multi-asset fund of funds portfolios of a large investment bank. In this study, multiple risk models and measures with transparent assumptions to cross-validate convergent findings across multiple levels of risk analysis are examined for empirical model risk management.Journal granted non-exclusive copyright to publish the article: Author retains all copyrights:Malhotra, Yogesh.

        "content": "Korea and China established formal relations 30 years ago. Vibrant bilateral trade has significantly contributed to the economic growth of both nations. However, a remarkable turning point has occurred recently: Bilateral trade seemed to balance out due to China’s lockdown policy and Korea’s stronger corporate competitiveness, but Korea has posted a trade deficit with China since last year for all goods except semiconductors. Such a deficit could signal the beginning of structural change, though the figure over the last four months might be a temporary phenomenon.Over the last 30 years, high-tech industries have played an increasingly important role in bilateral trade in both exports and imports. In exports, semiconductors, petrochemicals, and displays have leading positions but in imports, Korean manufacturing is highly dependent on China, which is expanding into other industries. That means Korea is increasingly reliant on components or raw materials from China, leading to greater risk factors.To effectively respond to the short-term deficit and mid- to long-term structural changes in trade with China, Korea must diversify its import partners, even if doing so is likely to incur high costs in the short term. In the mid-term, the country should develop overseas resources and change its strategic approach to the global market, which should be framed as economic blocs, rather than as a single entity. Over the long term, Korea must strengthen its industrial competitiveness and foster high-tech human resources to secure key technologies to maintain its comparative advantage over China.For the first time in its modern trade with China, Korea recorded a trade deficit for four consecutive months, representing reversal major reversal of roles: Korea had in the past recorded enormous trade surpluses in the tens of billions of USD. Thus looking at the trade deficit with China provides an opportunity to consider changes in the bilateral trade balance, the reasons for these changes, and potential responses to them.韩中两国建交30年来，充满活力的双边贸易为两国经济增长作出了重要贡献。但近期出现了一个显著转折点：受中国防疫封控政策和韩国企业竞争力增强影响，双边贸易原本看似趋于平衡，然而自去年起除半导体外所有商品对华贸易均转为逆差。这一逆差可能预示着结构性变化的开端，尽管过去四个月的数据或许只是暂时现象。过去30年间，高科技产业在双边贸易进出口中的比重持续提升。出口方面半导体、石油化工和显示器占据主导地位，但进口领域韩国制造业对中国依赖度极高，且这种依赖正蔓延至其他产业。这意味着韩国对中国产零部件和原材料的依存度日益加深，风险因素不断累积。为有效应对对华贸易短期逆差和中长期结构性变化，韩国必须推动进口来源多元化，即便短期内可能承受较高成本。中期来看，应加快海外资源开发，并将全球市场按经济区块而非单一实体重新制定战略布局。长期而言，必须强化产业竞争力，培育高科技人才以掌握关键技术，维持对中国的比较优势。韩国在现代对华贸易史上首次出现连续四个月逆差，标志着双方角色发生重大逆转——过去韩国曾创下数百亿美元的巨额顺差。因此审视对华贸易逆差现象，为我们提供了思考双边贸易格局变迁、成因及应对策略的重要契机。资源链接: Structural Changes in Korea-ChinaTradeand Policy Implications",

        "content": "The protectionist trade measures promulgated by U.S. President Donald Trump during his campaign for the presidency in late 2016 have gradually become a legal reality since his inauguration. The continued proliferation of these protectionist measures has been characterized as an irresponsible policy that ignores deleterious economic effects, while others describe them as a predictable result.If the Trump administration’s trade policy is little more than a set of arbitrary determinations made through an irrational decision-making process, as many experts propose, our capability to respond is very limited. On the other hand, if Trump’s trade policy is determined in a lucid way through a prepared process, we can form expectations of what effects such policies might have, and can prepare a systematically-devised response. This study recognizes Trump’s trade policy not as an irrational conviction but rather as something that has been carefully formulated, and aims to find ways to systematically respond to the continuing proliferation of protectionist trade measures.For this study, we will examine current trends in the proliferation of the U.S. government’s protectionist trade policy and its impact on the economy. This will show that there is a high level of concern about Trump’s trade policy within the U.S. itself.美国总统唐纳德·特朗普在2016年底竞选期间颁布的贸易保护措施，自其就职以来已逐步成为法律现实。这些保护主义措施的持续扩散被描述为忽视有害经济影响的不负责任政策，也有人认为这是可预见的结果。如果如许多专家所言，特朗普政府的贸易政策只是通过非理性决策过程做出的一系列武断决定，那么我们的应对能力将非常有限。反之，若这些政策是通过缜密流程清醒制定的，我们就能预判其可能产生的效应，并制定系统化的应对方案。本研究将特朗普贸易政策视为精心设计的产物而非非理性执念，旨在探索系统应对保护主义贸易措施持续扩散的路径。为此，我们将分析美国政府保护主义贸易政策的蔓延趋势及其经济影响，揭示美国国内对特朗普贸易政策存在高度忧虑的现状。资源链接: The Sustainability of Trump’sTradePolicies",

        "content": "The use of the traditional trade barriers, such as tariffs and quotas, has become less common over the last two decades due to the expansion of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) regime. Yet, at the same time there has been a notable increase in the use of non-tariff measures (NTM) for many products in most countries. In this environment, technical barriers to trade (TBT)—a sub-category of NTM and one of the main obstacles to trade—are crucial factors firms must take into consideration when exporting goods. Since Korea relies largely on exports for economic growth, it is necessary for the government to understand the economic impact of TBT.One of the main objectives of the EU is to prevent the erection of trade barriers within its borders. It follows that the coordination of technical regulations among EU member states is of a vital importance. The EU currently employs two main approaches to coordination : Harmonization (HR) and Mutual Recognition (MR). In harmonized fields, all member states agree to adopt uniform technical regulations.The European Union is Korea’s third-largest trading partner by volume, after China and the U.S. In addition, it plays a leading role in the design and implementation of new TBT that are consequently adopted by many other countries. In this paper, I analyze the impact of the EU’s TBT on Korean exports. In particular, I study the impact under the EU’s various approaches to removing TBT among member countries.过去二十年间，由于《关税与贸易总协定》（GATT）体系的扩展，关税和配额等传统贸易壁垒的使用已逐渐减少。然而与此同时，多数国家对众多产品采取的非关税措施（NTM）却显著增加。在此背景下，作为非关税措施子类目和主要贸易障碍之一的技术性贸易壁垒（TBT），成为企业出口商品时必须考量的关键因素。由于韩国经济增长高度依赖出口，政府有必要理解技术性贸易壁垒的经济影响。欧盟的主要目标之一是防止其内部设立贸易壁垒，因此成员国间技术法规的协调至关重要。欧盟目前采用两种主要协调方式：统一化（HR）与相互认可（MR）。在统一化领域，所有成员国同意采用完全一致的技术法规。欧盟是韩国继中国和美国之后的第三大贸易伙伴，同时在新技术性贸易壁垒的设计与实施方面发挥着主导作用，这些壁垒随后被众多其他国家采纳。本文分析了欧盟技术性贸易壁垒对韩国出口的影响，重点研究了欧盟采用不同方法消除成员国间技术性贸易壁垒时所产生的效应。资源链接: The Economic Impacts of the EU’s Approach to TBT Coordination",

        "content": "New information and communication technologies have developed significantly, and now wield considerable influence on the traditional commodity trade. The concept of digital trade has emerged around the world and has drawn global attention. Digital trade is a form of trade in which information and communication technology plays an important role. The characteristics of digital trade are, for the most part, twofold.First is the digitalization of the method of exchange. Information and communication technologies have changed the way traditional trade is conducted, and e-commerce platforms have become an important hub for international trade. Information display, trade negotiations, payments and settlements and tax clearance are done online, greatly reducing trade costs and improving efficiency.The second is the digitization of trade goods, that is, the digital services trade: data and products in the form of data. Services are traded globally through information and communication networks, and their impact on production and transaction continues to expand. Recently, new technologies such as cloud computing and big data continue to develop, and the content of digital trade is diversifying continuously, especially in China and the U.S. The importance of digital trade has also grown. Moreover, China has increased its digital trade and influence in different regions by promoting its Belt and Road project. Accordingly, this paper seeks to grasp digital trade and analyzes the digital trade in China, dividing it into digital product (software) trade, digital service trade and e-commerce trade.This study concludes with a description of the implications for policy carried by the results of the analysis.新型信息通信技术发展迅猛，对传统商品贸易产生显著影响。数字贸易概念已在全球范围内兴起并引发广泛关注。数字贸易是一种信息通信技术发挥重要作用的贸易形式，其核心特征主要体现在两个方面：首先是交易方式的数字化。信息通信技术改变了传统贸易的开展模式，电子商务平台成为国际贸易的重要枢纽，信息展示、贸易洽谈、支付结算及通关纳税均在线完成，大幅降低贸易成本并提升效率。其次是贸易标的的数字化，即数字服务贸易：以数据形式存在的数据及产品通过信息通信网络进行全球交易，其对生产与交易的影响持续扩大。近年来，随着云计算、大数据等新技术不断发展，数字贸易内涵持续丰富，在中美等国的重要性日益凸显。中国更通过推进”一带一路”建设，增强了在不同区域的数字贸易规模与影响力。基于此，本文旨在系统把握数字贸易内涵，将中国数字贸易划分为数字产品（软件）贸易、数字服务贸易和电子商务贸易三大类进行分析。研究最后根据分析结果阐述了相关政策启示。资源链接: DigitalTradein China and its Implications",

        "content": "Regional trade or regional integration is becoming increasingly important. According to Milberg et al (2013), in the post-Washington Consensus world of today, regional trade and integration are promoted not only to expand markets but also to create regional production networks, especially in the electronics sector of East Asia and the apparel industry of Southern Africa.However, intraregional trade in Africa is limited relative to extraregional trade, especially when compared to Asia, North America and Europe, where intraregional trade volume in intermediate goods exceeds extraregional trade. Intraregional trade in intermediate goods in Africa is just one third of the extraregional trade (Ahmed &amp; Primi, 2017, p. 78). So it is fair to say that thus far African nations have missed the opportunity to enhance value addition in production through intraregional trade.From this point of view, this paper analyzes both intra- and extra-regional trade in Africa, focusing on East Africa, to determine whether intraregional trade can serve as an opportunity not only to bolster broad-based industrial development but critically to upgrade the value added of East African industrial products. For this paper, industrial upgrading refers to the process of industrial improvement on the value chain, from the production of low-value goods to higher value-added products or services.区域贸易或区域一体化正变得越来越重要。根据Milberg等人（2013年）的研究，在当今后华盛顿共识的世界中，推动区域贸易和一体化不仅是为了扩大市场，更是为了建立区域生产网络，特别是在东亚的电子行业和南部非洲的服装行业。然而，非洲区域内贸易相对于区域外贸易较为有限，尤其是与亚洲、北美和欧洲相比，这些地区的中间产品区域内贸易量超过了区域外贸易。非洲中间产品的区域内贸易仅为区域外贸易的三分之一（Ahmed &amp; Primi，2017年，第78页）。因此可以说，迄今为止，非洲国家错失了通过区域内贸易提升生产附加值的机会。从这个角度来看，本文分析了非洲的区域内和区域外贸易，重点研究东非地区，以确定区域内贸易是否不仅可以作为促进广泛工业发展的机会，更重要的是能否提升东非工业产品的附加值。在本文中，产业升级指的是在价值链上实现工业改进的过程，从生产低价值产品转向更高附加值的产品或服务。资源链接: Is IntraregionalTradean Opportunity for Industrial Upgrading in East Africa?",

        "content": "Since trade liberalization started in earnest in the 1990s, conventional trade barriers, such as tariffs, have been dropping steadily worldwide. Under the WTO regime, member countries are unable to impose tariff higher than set rates, and effective tariff rates have been decreasing consistently as a result. In addition, the spread of multilateral and bilateral trade agreements has accelerated this phenomenon. It follows that many governments have begun to use non-tariff measures (NTMs), such as technological measures, standards, and intellectual property rights, as strategic trade policies. The variety and volume of NTMs have increased.According to Annex 1.2 of the WTO’s TBT Agreement, “standards” refer to “document approved by a recognized body, that provides, for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for products or related processes and production methods, with which compliance is not mandatory.”Standards are intended primarily to improve the compatibility and quality of products and reinforce consumer protection, but may serve as de facto trade barriers that prevent foreign corporations from entering the domestic market and protect domestic businesses, whether the domestic governments intend it or not. The U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and Regulations (FMVSS) gives a good example of using standards as trade barriers. In most countries, vehicles are produced according to international safety standards called the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), which are accepted in just about every country in the world except the US and Canada. Foreign automakers, who already produce their products under UNECE and wish to export them to the U.S. and Canada, must satisfy the FMVSS and thus must modify their UNECE-compliance models. This then creates additional costs for the foreign firms, who already face stiff competition from American firms in the U.S. market.This paper models the effects of standards harmonization between countries with different technological capacities. Standards harmonization is effectively a way of eliminating standards as a NTM trade barrier.自20世纪90年代贸易自由化真正开始以来，全球范围内的关税等传统贸易壁垒持续下降。在世贸组织框架下，成员国不得征收超过设定税率的关税，因此实际关税税率持续走低。此外，多边和双边贸易协定的普及加速了这一趋势。这使得许多政府开始将技术性措施、标准、知识产权等非关税措施（NTM）作为战略性贸易政策，其种类和数量与日俱增。. . 根据世贸组织《技术性贸易壁垒协定》附件1.2的定义，”标准”指”经公认机构批准的、规定产品或相关工艺和生产方法的规则、指南或特性的文件，要求共同和重复使用，其合规性并非强制”。标准的主要目的是提高产品兼容性和质量、加强消费者保护，但无论政府初衷如何，都可能成为事实上的贸易壁垒，阻碍外资企业进入国内市场并保护本土企业。. . 美国《联邦机动车安全标准与法规》（FMVSS）就是标准作为贸易壁垒的典型案例。多数国家采用联合国欧洲经济委员会（UNECE）制定的国际安全标准生产汽车，该标准被除美加以外的全球各国普遍接受。已按UNECE标准生产汽车的外国制造商若想出口美加市场，必须满足FMVSS要求，这意味着需对符合UNECE标准的车型进行改造。这给本就面临美国本土企业激烈竞争的外国车企增加了额外成本。. . 本文构建了技术能力存在差异的国家间标准协调效应模型。标准协调实质上是消除标准作为非关税贸易壁垒的一种方式。资源链接: The Economic Effects of Standards Harmonization between Technologically Asymmetric Countries",

        "content": "Processing trade contributed greatly to China’s economic growth. The total value of China’s processing trade was US $1.7 billion during the initial period of reform and opening up, and reached US $1.2 trillion in 2015. However, the proportion of processing trade in China’s trade volume has been gradually declining due to the restrictions on processing trade imposed in the 2000s, a decline in overseas demand since the global financial crisis, and increasing labor costs in China. Nevertheless, its proportion still constitutes about 30% of the total trade value of China, remaining important. In particular, the percentage of processing trade with Korea accounts for approximately 50%, playing a vital role in China’s total trade with Korea.This seeks to grasp the structural changes in the China-South Korea trade and regulatory environment over time, and describes the implication for policy carried by the analysis.加工贸易对中国经济增长贡献巨大。改革开放初期，中国加工贸易总额仅为17亿美元，到2015年已攀升至1.2万亿美元。但由于2000年代对加工贸易实施的限制、全球金融危机后海外需求下降以及中国劳动力成本上升等因素，加工贸易在中国贸易总额中的占比逐渐下降。尽管如此，其占比仍保持在中国贸易总额的30%左右，地位依然重要。其中中韩加工贸易占比约达50%，在中韩双边贸易中发挥着关键作用。本研究旨在把握中韩贸易结构与监管环境的历时性变迁，并阐释分析结果对政策制定的启示。资源链接: Structural Changes in the Korea-China ProcessingTrade",

        "content": "The growing energy security and climate change concerns have created a huge demand and global market for renewable energy technologies such as solar panels. The race to capture a share of this lucrative global market and other political economy considerations have inspired a trade war. Much of this war has been fought with and against green industrial policy measures such as subsidies tied to local content requirements and trade remedy instruments such as antidumping and countervailing duties. Safeguard measures are the latest additions to the armoury of trade defence measures in this burgeoning trade war. This article examines the dynamics behind and the implications of the turn to renewable energy safeguards for the global effort to accelerate the development and deployment of renewable energy technologies in light of the recent WTO Panel report on US – Safeguard Measure on PV Products. The article makes three interrelated arguments. First, the WTO jurisprudence on renewable energy support measures and rapidly evolving global value chains in renewable energy technologies helped spur the turn to safeguard measures. Second, the seal of approval from the Panel will drive interest in the use of renewable energy safeguards. Third, the increased and unfettered use of safeguard measures is detrimental to the transition towards sustainable energy sources.日益增长的能源安全和气候变化问题为太阳能电池板等可再生能源技术创造了巨大需求和全球市场。争夺这一利润丰厚的全球市场份额的竞争以及其他政治经济因素引发了一场贸易战。这场战争大多围绕与本地含量要求挂钩的补贴等绿色产业政策措施，以及反倾销和反补贴税等贸易救济工具展开。保障措施成为这场新兴贸易战中贸易防御武器库的最新成员。本文结合世贸组织专家组关于美国——光伏产品保障措施案的报告，探讨了转向可再生能源保障措施背后的动态及其对全球加速开发和部署可再生能源技术努力的影响。文章提出了三个相互关联的观点：首先，世贸组织关于可再生能源支持措施的判例以及快速演变的可再生能源技术全球价值链助推了保障措施的转向；其次，专家组裁决的认可将推动各国对使用可再生能源保障措施的兴趣；第三，保障措施的滥用将阻碍向可持续能源的转型。资源链接: The Turn to SafeguardMeasuresin the SolarTradeWar",

        "content": "International trade of agricultural products has complicated and far-reaching impacts on land and nitrogen use efficiencies. We analysed the productivity of cropland and livestock and associated use of feed and fertilizer efficiency for over 240 countries, and estimated these countries’ cumulative contributions to imports and exports of 190 agricultural products for the period 1961–2017. Crop trade has increased global land and partial fertilizer nitrogen productivities in terms of protein production, which equalled savings of 2,270 Mha cropland and 480 Tg synthetic fertilizer nitrogen over the analysed period. However, crop trade decreased global cropland productivity when productivity is expressed on an energy (per calorie) basis. Agricultural trade has generally moved towards optimality, that is, has increased global land and nitrogen use efficiencies during 1961–2017, but remains at a relatively low level. Overall, mixed impacts of trade on resource use indicate the need to rethink trade patterns and improve their optimality.农产品国际贸易对土地利用效率和氮利用效率具有复杂而深远的影响。我们分析了240多个国家的作物种植和畜牧生产效率及相关饲料与化肥使用效率，并评估了这些国家在1961-2017年间对190种农产品进出口的累积贡献。以蛋白质产量衡量，作物贸易提高了全球土地生产率和部分氮肥生产率，相当于在分析期间节省了22.7亿公顷耕地和4800万吨合成氮肥。但若以能量（每卡路里）为衡量标准，作物贸易反而降低了全球耕地生产率。1961-2017年间，农业贸易总体上朝着优化方向发展——即提升了全球土地和氮利用效率，但仍处于较低水平。贸易对资源利用的混合影响表明，需要重新思考贸易模式并提升其优化程度。资源链接: Food and feed trade has greatly impacted global land and nitrogen use efficiencies over 1961–2017",

        "content": "Satisfying China’s food demand without harming the environment is one of the greatest sustainability challenges for the coming decades. Here we provide a comprehensive forward-looking assessment of the environmental impacts of China’s growing demand on the country itself and on its trading partners. We find that the increasing food demand, especially for livestock products (~16%–30% across all scenarios), would domestically require ~3–12 Mha of dditional pasture between 2020 and 2050, resulting in ~-2% to +16% growth in agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The projected ~15%–24% reliance on agricultural imports in 2050 would result in ~90–175 Mha of agricultural land area and ~88–226 MtCO2-equivalent yr-1of GHG emissions virtually imported to China, which account for ~26%–46% and ~13%–32% of China’s global environmental impacts, respectively. The distribution of the environmental impacts between China and the rest of the world would substantially depend on development of trade openness. Thus, to limit the negative environmental impacts of its growing food consumption, besides domestic policies, China needs to also take responsibility in the development of sustainable international trade.在不损害环境的情况下满足中国的粮食需求是未来几十年最大的可持续发展挑战之一。本文对中国日益增长的粮食需求对本国及贸易伙伴造成的环境影响进行了全面前瞻性评估。研究发现，不断增长的食品需求（尤其是畜产品需求，所有情景下增幅约16%-30%）将导致2020至2050年间国内需新增约300-1200万公顷牧场，农业温室气体排放量将增长约-2%至+16%。预计到2050年中国约15%-24%的农业依赖进口，这将导致约9000-17500万公顷农业用地和约8.8-22.6亿吨二氧化碳当量/年的温室气体通过虚拟进口形式输入中国，分别占中国全球环境影响的26%-46%和13%-32%。中国与全球其他地区之间的环境影响分配将在很大程度上取决于贸易开放程度的发展。因此，为限制不断增长的食品消费对环境的负面影响，除国内政策外，中国还需在推动可持续国际贸易发展方面承担责任。资源链接: China’s future food demand and its implications for trade and environment",

        "content": "In impact investing, impact risk encompasses the probability that investment projects may fail to achieve the expected positive impact (i.e., positive impact risk) and/or may have a negative impact (i.e., negative impact risk). Using an inductive research approach, this study examines how impact investing organizations adopt control mechanisms to manage impact risk. It finds that impact investors adopt a wide range of input, behavior, and output control mechanisms to manage impact risk that may arise from investee-level, investor-level, and system-level operations. Also, to manage impact risk, investors establish control mechanisms to influence relevant actors not only within a firm’s boundary but also outside its boundary. Given the inherent complexity and ambiguity in managing impact risk in impact investing, control mechanisms appear to rely heavily on judgment and experience and adhere more to the “satisficing” principle. Furthermore, investors tend to focus more on managing positive impact risk than negative impact risk.在影响力投资中，影响风险包括投资项目可能无法实现预期积极影响（即积极影响风险）和/或可能产生负面影响（即负面影响风险）的概率。本研究采用归纳研究方法，探讨影响力投资组织如何采用控制机制来管理影响风险。研究发现，影响力投资者采用多种输入、行为和输出控制机制，以管理可能来自被投企业层面、投资者层面和系统层面运营的影响风险。此外，为管理影响风险，投资者不仅在公司边界内建立控制机制以影响相关行为者，还在公司边界外采取相应措施。鉴于影响力投资中管理影响风险固有的复杂性和模糊性，控制机制似乎严重依赖判断和经验，并更倾向于遵循“满意化”原则。此外，投资者往往更注重管理积极影响风险，而非负面影响风险。资源链接: ImpactRiskManagement In Impact Investing: How Impact Investing Organizations AdoptControlMechanisms To Manage Their ImpactRisk",

        "content": "This chapter suggests a rationale for a simple, scalable, and fast computational approach through the ‘Data With Direction Specification’ (DWDS) to supplement the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). The specification provides a way for digitally executable versions of rules to be published on the Internet in a platform-agnostic open standard format, across all types of rule-makers and rule-takers, together with the means to allow efficient discovery and transmission of information about rules that are ‘in effect’, ‘applicable’ to any category of transaction, and to be ‘invoked’ by a particular transaction. Relations of obligation, permission, and encouragement can be expressed and understood in the natural language, including vernacular languages, of each stakeholder and equivalently by their heterogeneous computational systems. The resulting ‘Internet of Rules’ (IoR) is intended to enable computer-assisted rules-based coordination for human-centred algorithmic governance. To bolster the resilience of Africa’s markets to social, ecological, and epidemiological disruption, such a ‘Trade Policy 3.0’ approach would make it possible for users to automatically fetch rules via applications and, at the discretion of the parties, invoke rules to digitally automate cross-border compliance in alignment with the policies of national jurisdictions, Regional Economic Communities, and the AfCFTA framework.本章提出了一种简单、可扩展且快速的计算方法原理，即通过“带方向的数据规范”（DWDS），以补充非洲大陆自由贸易区（AfCFTA）的实施。该规范提供了一种方式，使规则的数字可执行版本能够以平台无关的开放标准格式发布在互联网上，覆盖所有类型的规则制定者和规则接受者，同时提供了高效发现和传输关于“有效”、“适用于”任何类别交易的规则信息的手段，并允许特定交易“调用”这些规则。义务、许可和鼓励的关系可以用各利益相关方的自然语言（包括方言）表达和理解，并通过其异构计算系统等效实现。由此形成的“规则互联网”（IoR）旨在实现以人为中心的算法治理中基于规则的计算机辅助协调。为增强非洲市场对社会、生态和流行病干扰的韧性，这种“贸易政策3.0”方法使用户能够通过应用程序自动获取规则，并在各方自主决定的情况下调用规则，以数字化方式自动实现跨境合规，与国家司法管辖区、区域经济共同体和AfCFTA框架的政策保持一致。资源链接: Implementing the African Continental FreeTradeArea: A Simple, Scalable, and Fast Computational Approach for Algorithmic Governance",

        "content": "Amid increasing implementations of various regulations and measures for environmental protection in many countries with the widening awareness of environmental issues, the discussion of trade liberalization of environmental goods and services (EGS) in the international community has also been revitalized. Since its establishment in 1995, the WTO (World Trade Organization) has discussed this subject in the trade and environment committee. One of the main issues is lowering tariff levels and the reduction and elimination of non-tariff barriers on EGS.With regard to trade liberalization of environment-related goods in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Ministerial Meeting of 2012, it was agreed that discussions on trade liberalization will be focused on 54 items by HS 6-digit classification. Among these 54 items, the photovoltaic equipment solar panels, wind power generators, sorting crushers for recycling, liquid filters, and precision equipment for environmental analysis are included. Moreover, even in the WTO, Japan, US, EU, South Korea, Switzerland, Singapore, Australia and Canada started negotiations in January 2014 of a tariff reduction for new environment-related goods in volunteer countries in order to achieve both environmental protection and trade promotion.While Korea’s exports of environmental goods and services remained under the level of 5 billion US dollars in the early 1990s, it soared to over 40 billion US dollars in 2013.This article analyzes Korea’s EGS trade toward China according to the category of common OECD/WTO/APEC EGS classification. Of course, recent trends and issues of trade liberalization of EGS among international institutions such as WTO and APEC are summarized, and the conclusion suggests some policy implications.随着各国环保意识不断增强，各类环保法规措施日益广泛实施，国际社会关于环境商品与服务（EGS）贸易自由化的讨论也再度活跃。自1995年成立以来，世界贸易组织（WTO）一直在贸易与环境委员会中探讨这一议题，其核心内容之一便是降低环境商品与服务的关税水平及削减非关税壁垒。2012年亚太经合组织（APEC）部长级会议就环境相关产品贸易自由化达成共识，决定以HS六位编码为标准重点讨论54类商品，其中包括光伏设备太阳能板、风力发电机、回收分选破碎机、液体过滤器及环境分析精密仪器等。2014年1月，日本、美国、欧盟、韩国、瑞士、新加坡、澳大利亚和加拿大等国更在WTO框架下启动自愿参与的环境新品关税减让谈判，旨在实现环境保护与贸易促进的双重目标。韩国环境商品与服务出口额从上世纪90年代初不足50亿美元，到2013年已突破400亿美元大关。本文依据经合组织/WTO/APEC通用环境商品与服务分类标准，系统分析了韩国对中国环境商品与服务的贸易状况，梳理了WTO、APEC等国际机构在环境商品与服务贸易自由化方面的最新动态与争议焦点，并在结论部分提出相关政策建议。资源链接: An Analysis of Korea’s Environmental GoodsTradeto China and its Policy Implications",

        "content": "In this paper, we investigate the effects of preferential trade agreements on trade volumes for over 170 countries from 1970 to 2010 using the microfounded gravity model.To disentangle the relative impact of partners’ income groups (North-North, North-South, and South-South) and levels of economic integration, this study uses uni-directional trade flows between two countries and disaggregate types of agreement (Customs Unions, Free Trade Agreements, and Partial Scope Agreements). Preferential trade liberalization was found to have strong positive effects on trade between two trade partners on average.The South-South RTAs have the strongest trade-creating effect in comparison to other combinations of trade agreements. Surprisingly, the North’s trade-creating effects were found to be much stronger in North-South trade agreements.These results imply that developed countries experience more beneficial effects on exports than developing or less developed countries through preferential trade agreements. Moreover, Custom Unions were found to have stronger trade-creating effects than FTAs or PSAs.本文运用微观基础引力模型，研究了1970至2010年间 preferential trade agreements 对170余个国家贸易流量的影响。为区分贸易伙伴收入群体（北北型、南北型、南南型）与经济一体化水平的相对作用，本研究采用两国间单向贸易流数据，并对协定类型（关税同盟、自由贸易协定、局部范围协定）进行细分分析。研究发现，preferential trade liberalization 平均而言对贸易伙伴间交易量具有显著促进作用。与其他类型协定相比，南南型区域贸易协定产生的贸易创造效应最为突出。出人意料的是，北方国家在南北型协定中表现出更强的贸易创造效应，这表明发达国家通过preferential trade agreements获得的出口收益高于发展中国家或欠发达国家。此外，关税同盟的贸易创造效应强于自由贸易协定或局部范围协定。资源链接: The Effects ofTradeAgreements onTrade: Asymmetric Partners and Types of Agreements",

        "content": "China, the largest trading partner of Korea, is emerging as a key player in the world economy. However, China’s processing trade is not emphasized despite its role and importance due to the wrong perception concerning processing trade. Only low value-added products are associated with processing trade, which is thought to decay in the near future. However, in China-Korea trade, the proportion of processing trade is high (nearly half), and it is concentrated in high value-added industries such as electronics.Therefore, it is expected to continue in the future. In the early days, the processing trade of China was concentrated in labor-intensive items, but with foreign-funded enterprises and related R&amp;D expansion, the proportion of technology-intensive items such as electronics and machinery increased gradually. This contributed to the enhancement of the overall technology level of China. There is an assessment that contributes towards relieving the unemployment problem in China. However, still a significant portion of the processing trade consists of the simple processing and assembling stages.The high portion of simple processing trade is an obstacle to the advancement of industrial structure and China’s own brand value. As part of the background to these discussions, the Chinese government has been expanding the scope of the processing trade restrictions continuously to promote the advancement of the domestic industry since 1999. However, as part of the economic stimulus package to offset the impact of the global financial crisis, processing trade restrictions were eased in 2009.Along with the recovery of the world economy in 2010, the Chinese government is again expanding the scope of the restrictions. It is expected that more prohibited items for processing trade will be added, which will be a burden for related industries. In this study, we provide strategic implications for Korea’s approach to China by analyzing the structural changes and related policy changes in China. In particular, this paper attempts to analyze the industrial processing trade between Korea and China by using China Custom trade data.中国作为韩国最大的贸易伙伴，正在世界经济中扮演关键角色。然而，由于对加工贸易存在认知误区，其作用和重要性未得到充分重视——人们往往将加工贸易与低附加值产品挂钩，并认为其即将衰退。但中韩贸易中加工贸易占比高达近半数，且集中于电子等高附加值产业，因此预计未来仍将持续发展。早期中国加工贸易以劳动密集型产品为主，随着外资企业入驻及相关研发投入扩大，电子、机械等技术密集型产品比重逐步提升，这对中国整体技术水平的提高产生了积极影响。有评估认为加工贸易对缓解中国就业压力具有贡献，但目前仍存在大量简单加工组装环节。这种高比例的简单加工贸易阻碍了产业结构升级和中国自主品牌价值提升。作为政策背景，中国政府自1999年起持续扩大加工贸易限制范围以促进国内产业升级，但2009年为应对全球金融危机冲击放宽了限制。随着2010年世界经济复苏，中国政府再次扩大限制范围，预计未来将新增更多加工贸易禁止类目，这将对相关产业造成压力。本研究通过分析中国加工贸易结构变化及相关政策调整，为韩国对华策略提供战略启示。特别地，本文尝试运用中国海关贸易数据对中韩产业加工贸易进行实证分析。资源链接: China’s ProcessingTrade: Trends and Implications",

        "content": "The simultaneous exports and imports within same industries is well known as the intra-industry trade (IIT). Since the pioneering empirical literatures of Balassa (1966)1) and Grubel and Lloyd (1975)2), bunch of empirical and theoretical papers studied this new paradigm of international trade challenging to the classical Heckscher - Ohlin paradigm. On the steps of IIT studies, the most essential progress was the division of IIT into Horizontal IIT (HIIT) and Vertical IIT (VIIT). This classification is based on the characteristics of product differentiation. HIIT is the trade of product which is close substitute but differ in characteristics, on the contrary VIIT differ in embodied quality level.In empirical literatures, the division between HIIT and VIIT is accomplished by unit price comparison. If unit price ratio defined as export product price over import product price of product which belong to same industry goes to specific range, this trade is on HIIT and if that ratio is out of that range this kind of trade go to VIIT. This simple methodology have been very common practical way for IIT research and generally the price ratio range for HIIT is 75~125% or 85~115%. In other words, if a product’s export price is higher than import price over 125% (or 115%) or lower than import price below 75% (or 85%), both cases are classified as VIIT. Another progress in IIT studies was the research on the determinants of HIIT/VIIT. Various countryand industry-specific determinants have been studied and differences in factor endowments and market size, physical and/or institutional barrier against trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) are the key elements determining IIT in country level.Though these determinants have been studied extensively during past decades, little is known of the impact of national technological capacity on IIT. Considering VIIT as occurring from product differentiation with quality difference, this is very surprising.In these perspectives, this paper investigates the determinants of Korea’s VIIT with special interest on national R&amp;D stock. Classical analysis of VIIT will be followed by separated investigation of HQ-VIIT (Higher Quality VIIT) and LQ-VIIT (Lower Quality VIIT). This segregated analysis will give deepened understanding of VIIT determinants.同一行业内同时存在的出口与进口现象被称为产业内贸易(IIT)。自Balassa(1966)和Grubel与Lloyd(1975)的开创性实证研究以来，大量实证与理论文献开始研究这一挑战传统赫克歇尔-俄林范式的新型国际贸易模式。在产业内贸易研究进程中，最重要的进展是将产业内贸易划分为水平型产业内贸易(HIIT)与垂直型产业内贸易(VIIT)。这种分类基于产品差异化的特征：水平型产业内贸易指特性不同但可相互替代的产品贸易，而垂直型产业内贸易则体现为产品质量等级的差异。. . 在实证研究中，通常采用单位价格比较法区分水平型与垂直型产业内贸易。若某行业产品出口单价与进口单价比值处于特定区间（通常为75%~125%或85%~115%），则归为水平型产业内贸易；若超出该区间则视为垂直型产业内贸易。这种简易方法已成为产业内贸易研究的通行做法。具体而言，当某产品出口价格高于进口价格125%（或115%）以上，或低于进口价格75%（或85%）以下时，均被归类为垂直型产业内贸易。. . 产业内贸易研究的另一进展是对其决定因素的探索。学者们研究了诸多国家与行业层面的影响因素，发现要素禀赋差异、市场规模、贸易与外商直接投资(FDI)的实体/制度壁垒是国家层面产业内贸易的关键决定因素。尽管这些因素在过去数十年得到广泛研究，但国家技术能力对产业内贸易的影响却鲜有涉及——考虑到垂直型产业内贸易源于产品质量差异形成的产品差异化，这一研究空白令人意外。. . 基于上述背景，本文重点考察韩国垂直型产业内贸易的决定因素，特别关注国家研发存量的影响。在经典垂直型产业内贸易分析基础上，本文还将分别研究高质量垂直型产业内贸易(HQ-VIIT)与低质量垂直型产业内贸易(LQ-VIIT)，这种分类研究将深化对垂直型产业内贸易决定机制的理解。资源链接: Patterns of Vertical Intra-IndustryTradeConsidering Differences in Quality: The South Korean Case",

        "content": "These data were collected during an intraguild predation (IGP) experiment using aggressive and docile individuals of the damsel bug, Nabis americoferus. The obejctive was to understand the role of aggressiveness within IGP interactionThis experiment included two other species, Lygus lineolaris as the extraguild prey and Orius insidiosus as the intraguild prey.The experiment included two types of response variables: the number of attacks by N. americoferus toward O. insidiosus and the mortality of both O. insidiosus and L. lineolaris.The two explanatory variables are the behavioral type of N. americoferus (i.e., aggressive or docile line) and the presence or absence of extraguild prey.Description of the Data and file structureThe data is divided into 5 columns: nabis, resources, totalattack, oriusdead and lygusdead.- Nabis : corresponds to the type of Nabis used, i.e. aggressive, docile or the absence of the latter for the control treatment.- Resources : corresponds to the presence or absence of extra-guild prey. If there is no extra-guilded prey, it is written none, if it is present, it is written lygus.- Totalattack : corresponds to the number of attacks made by Nabis on Orius within 15 minutes of the start of the experiment.- Oriusdead : corresponds to the number of prey intrgauildes found after 24 hours.- Lygusdead : corresponds to the number of extra-guild prey found dead after 24 hours.Results were analyzed with R software using a generalized linear model (GLM) following a binomial distribution for IGP because the mortality rate was constrained between zero and five for L. lineolaris and zero and three for O. insidiosus.Therefore, to fit with a binomial distribution, this part of the dataset has been transformed by dividing the number of dead O. insidiosus by three and the number of dead L. linerolaris by five. Following the transformation, the dataset of the IGP was ranged between 0 and 1.As the attack rate had no constrained values, it was analyzed with GLM model for Poisson distributed data. For every models, an interaction was used between the two explanatory variables (i.e. columns nabis and ressrouces).这些数据是在一项关于美洲姬蝽（Nabis americoferus）攻击性与温顺个体间的集团内捕食（IGP）实验中收集的，旨在探究攻击性在IGP交互中的作用。实验还包含另外两个物种：作为集团外猎物的牧草盲蝽（Lygus lineolaris）和作为集团内猎物的花蝽（Orius insidiosus）。实验设计了两类响应变量：美洲姬蝽对花蝽的攻击次数，以及花蝽和牧草盲蝽的死亡率。两个解释变量分别为美洲姬蝽的行为类型（攻击型或温顺型品系）和集团外猎物的存在与否。. . 数据描述与文件结构. 数据分为5列：nabis、resources、totalattack、oriusdead和lygusdead。. - Nabis：表示使用的美洲姬蝽类型，即攻击型、温顺型或对照组（无蝽虫）。. - Resources：表示集团外猎物的存在情况。若不存在记为”none”，存在则记为”lygus”。. - Totalattack：记录实验开始15分钟内美洲姬蝽对花蝽的攻击次数。. - Oriusdead：24小时后发现的死亡集团内猎物数量。. - Lygusdead：24小时后发现的死亡集团外猎物数量。. . 数据分析. 使用R软件通过广义线性模型（GLM）进行结果分析。由于牧草盲蝽死亡率限定在0至5之间，花蝽死亡率限定在0至3之间，IGP数据采用二项分布模型。为此，将死亡花蝽数除以3、死亡牧草盲蝽数除以5进行数据转换，使IGP数据集范围调整为0至1。攻击率因无数值限制，采用泊松分布的GLM模型进行分析。所有模型均包含两个解释变量（nabis列和resources列）的交互作用。资源链接: Data IGP",

A limit of detection of 1 ppm was obtained and sample concentrations up to 100 ppm CH4 were classified using a nine-category model. A range of algorithm enhancements were investigated including regularization, simple data segmentation and subset selection, feature selection via Variable Importance in Projection and wavelength variable compression in order to address the high dimensionality and collinearity of spectral emission data. These approaches showed the potential for significant reduction in the number of wavelength variables and the spectral resolution/bandwidth. Wavelength variable compression exhibited reliable predictive performance, with accuracy values &gt;97%, under more challenging multi-session train—test scenarios. Simple modelling of plasma electron energy distribution functions highlights the complex cross-sensitivities between the target methane, its dissociation products and atmospheric impurities and their impact on excitation and emission.利用小体积（5微升）大气压射频驱动氦等离子体的光学发射光谱，结合偏最小二乘判别分析，实现了痕量甲烷气体的检测。该方法检测限达1 ppm，并采用九分类模型对浓度高达100 ppm的甲烷样本进行了分类。针对光谱发射数据的高维度和共线性问题，研究探索了多种算法优化策略，包括正则化处理、简单数据分段与子集选择、基于投影变量重要性的特征筛选以及波长变量压缩。这些方法显著减少了波长变量数量，并降低了所需光谱分辨率/带宽。在更具挑战性的多批次训练-测试场景中，波长变量压缩展现出可靠的预测性能，准确率超过97%。通过对等离子体电子能量分布函数的简易建模，揭示了目标甲烷、其解离产物与大气杂质之间复杂的交叉敏感性，及其对激发与发射过程的影响。资源链接: Methanedetectionto 1 ppm using machine learning analysis of atmospheric pressure plasma optical emission spectra",

        "content": "Organismal responses to environmental stresses are a determinant of the effect of climate change. These can occur through the regulation of gene expression, involving genetic adaptation and plastic changes as evolutionary strategy. Heat shock protein (hsp) family genes are extensively expanded and play important roles in thermal adaptation in oysters. We investigated expression of all heat-responsive hsps in two allopatric congeneric oyster species, Crassostrea gigas and C. angulata, which are respectively distributed along the northern and southern coasts of China, using common garden and reciprocal transplant experiments. Our results showed that hsps in C. gigas have evolved higher basal levels of expression under ambient conditions at each field site, with lower expression plasticity in response to heat stress in comparison to C. angulata, which exhibited lower baseline expression but higher expression plasticity. This pattern was fixed regardless of environmental disturbance, potentially implying genetic assimilation. Our findings indicate divergent adaptive strategies with underlying evolutionary trade-offs between genetic adaptation and plasticity at the molecular level in two oyster congeners in the face of rapid climate change.生物对环境胁迫的响应是决定气候变化影响的关键因素。这些响应可通过基因表达的调控实现，涉及遗传适应与可塑性变化作为进化策略。热休克蛋白（hsp）基因家族在牡蛎中广泛扩增，对温度适应起着重要作用。我们通过同园种植与互移植实验，研究了分布于中国南北海岸的近缘种太平洋牡蛎（Crassostrea gigas）与葡萄牙牡蛎（C. angulata）中所有热响应hsp基因的表达特征。结果显示，与表现出较低基线表达但较高表达可塑性的葡萄牙牡蛎相比，太平洋牡蛎的hsp基因在各实验点常态环境下演化出更高的基础表达水平，而对热胁迫的表达可塑性较低。这种模式不受环境扰动影响而保持稳定，可能暗示了遗传同化现象。我们的研究揭示了两种近缘牡蛎在快速气候变化背景下，分子层面遗传适应与可塑性之间存在进化权衡的差异化适应策略。资源链接: Supplementary material from ‘Evolutionary trade-offs between baseline and plastic gene expression in two congeneric oyster species’",

        "content": "Abstract: The increasingly busy maritime traffic system has resulted in frequent maritime accidents. To prevent maritime accidents, we investigated and studied typical cases of maritime accidents along the coast of China in recent years. Based on the complex network theory, a network model of China’s coastal maritime traffic accidents is constructed from the four risk factors of human-ship-environmental-management. On this basis, the overall structural characteristics of the maritime accident network are analyzed according to the characteristic parameters of the complex network. In addition, based on the node betweenness and PageRank value, the network robustness analysis is carried out, the key factors in the maritime accidents are excavated and risk prevention and control measures are proposed. The research shows that the average path length of the marine traffic accident network is short, the clustering coefficient is high, and the risk spreads quickly in the network and passes through fewer nodes, which can lead to the occurrence of accidents. Through the management and control of key risk factors, the evolution of risks can be effectively blocked and the large and above maritime accidents can be reduced.摘要：日益繁忙的海上交通系统导致海上事故频发。为预防海上事故的发生，对近年来我国沿海典型海上事故案例进行调查和研究，基于复杂网络理论，从人-船-环境-管理4个风险因素出发构建我国沿海海上交通事故网络模型。在此基础上，根据复杂网络的特征参数对海上事故网络的整体结构特征进行分析。此外，基于节点介数和PageRank值进行网络鲁棒性分析，挖掘海上事故中的关键因素并提出风险防控措施。研究表明，海上交通事故网络的平均路径长度较短，聚类系数较高，风险在网络中传播速度快且经过较少的节点即可导致事故的发生。通过对关键风险因素进行管控，可有效阻断风险的演化，减少较大及以上海上事故的发生。资源链接: RiskEvolution and Prevention andControlStrategies of Maritime Accidents in China’s Coastal Areas Based on Complex Network Models",

        "content": "Outliers are often present in large datasets of water quality monitoring time series data. A method of combining the sliding window technique with Dixon detection criterion for the automatic detection of outliers in time series data is limited by the empirical determination of sliding window sizes. The scientific determination of the optimal sliding window size is very meaningful research work. This paper presents a new Monte Carlo Search Method (MCSM) based on random sampling to optimize the size of the sliding window, which fully takes advantage of computers and statistics. The MCSM was applied in a case study to automatic monitoring data of water quality factors in order to test its validity and usefulness. The results of comparing the accuracy and efficiency of the MCSM show that the new method in this paper is scientific and effective. The experimental results show that, at different sample sizes, the average accuracy is between 58.70% and 75.75%, and the average computation time increase is between 17.09% and 45.53%. In the era of big data in environmental monitoring, the proposed new methods can meet the required accuracy of outlier detection and improve the efficiency of calculation.水质监测时间序列大数据中常存在异常值。结合滑动窗口技术与Dixon检验准则的时间序列异常值自动检测方法受限于滑动窗口大小的经验性确定，科学确定最优滑动窗口尺寸是极具意义的研究工作。本文提出一种基于随机抽样的蒙特卡洛搜索新方法(MCSM)来优化滑动窗口尺寸，充分发挥计算机与统计学优势。为验证该方法的有效性和实用性，将MCSM应用于水质因子自动监测数据的案例研究。通过对比MCSM的准确率与效率结果表明，本文新方法具有科学性和有效性。实验结果显示在不同样本量下，平均准确率介于58.70%~75.75%之间，平均计算时间增幅介于17.09%~45.53%之间。在环境监测大数据时代，所提新方法既能满足异常值检测的精度要求，又可提升计算效率。资源链接: Water quality test data",

        "content": "There is currently considerable interest in the quantitative analysis tools of soundscape to derive supplemental information of a landscape. However, existing soundscape software for acoustic data analyses does not consider the geospatial characteristics of the landscape although they are essential components of soundscape ecology. The new software described in this paper, Soundscape Analysis and Mapping System (SAMS), allows users to quickly process and analyze large volumes of acoustic data in geospatial environment. Specifically, SAMS integrates soundscape data with landscape information and visualization on the same platform that can be directly retrieved from Google Earth. A soundscape case study, used as an example to demonstrate usefulness of the SAMS tool, revealed an obvious spatial heterogeneity of soundscape across the landscape. Further analyses suggested that the transformation of natural wetland ecosystems into various dispersed urban structures directly led to significant changes in soundscape properties, implying human-noise intrusion and reduction in avian vocalizations. Therefore, this new SAMS software offers a novel analytical tool for users, such as urban planners or acoustic ecologists, to assess the impact of spatial patterns on soundscape characteristics.目前，人们对声景的定量分析工具产生了浓厚兴趣，以获取景观的补充信息。然而，现有的声景软件在进行声学数据分析时并未考虑景观的地理空间特征，尽管这些特征是声景生态学的重要组成部分。本文描述的新软件——声景分析与制图系统（SAMS）——使用户能够在地理空间环境中快速处理和分析大量声学数据。具体而言，SAMS将声景数据与景观信息及可视化功能集成于同一平台，并可直接从谷歌地球获取数据。通过一个声景案例研究，展示了SAMS工具的实用性，该研究揭示了声景在景观中明显的空间异质性。进一步分析表明，自然湿地生态系统向各类分散城市结构的转变直接导致了声景特性的显著变化，暗示了人类噪声的侵入和鸟类鸣叫的减少。因此，这款新型SAMS软件为城市规划师或声学生态学家等用户提供了一种新颖的分析工具，用于评估空间格局对声景特征的影响。资源链接: Sound acquisition data and Automatic monitoring station data",

        "content": "We explore whether life insurers use a unique reinsurance arrangement to manage assets tied to their regulatory capital. Typical reinsurance allows insurers to reduce their regulatory capital by transferring liabilities (reserves), and the associated assets, to reinsurers. With modified coinsurance, insurers maintain control of their assets and liabilities while transferring regulatory capital requirements to the reinsurer. Holding fixed an insurer’s reported capital, we find that modified coinsurance allows insurers to report higher risk-based capital ratios. Insurers with modified coinsurance are less likely to fire sale downgraded bonds. We also find suggestive evidence of regulatory arbitrage, as most modified coinsurance is purchased from reinsurers in countries with low capital requirements or within the same insurance group.我们探讨寿险公司是否利用一种独特的再保险安排来管理与其监管资本相关的资产。传统再保险允许保险公司通过将负债（准备金）及相关资产转移给再保险人来降低监管资本要求。而在修正共保模式下，保险公司在将监管资本要求转移给再保险人的同时，仍保留对自身资产和负债的控制权。在保持保险公司账面资本不变的情况下，我们发现修正共保能使保险公司报告更高的风险资本比率。采用修正共保的保险公司更少出现降级债券抛售现象。我们还发现监管套利的迹象——大多数修正共保交易要么来自资本要求较低国家的再保险人，要么发生在同一保险集团内部。资源链接: Regulatory Capital and AssetRiskTransfer",

        "content": "We estimate the effects of technical barriers to trade (TBT) on machinery imports in international production networks. Using disaggregated detailed product data and the gravity model, we estimate the TBT notifications in two separate measures of TBT, namely cumulative TBT, and TBT dummy, evidencing significantly negative effects on machinery imports. This evidence suggests that TBT are trade barriers that restricts the development of machinery production networks. However, this negative effect appears to come from the final product. By contrast, TBT related to parts and components have larger positive effects than those related to final products for imports.我们评估了技术性贸易壁垒(TBT)对国际生产网络中机械产品进口的影响。通过使用细分的详细产品数据和引力模型，我们采用累计TBT和TBT虚拟变量两种测量方式对TBT通报进行估算，结果均显示其对机械进口具有显著负面影响。这一证据表明TBT是阻碍机械生产网络发展的贸易壁垒。然而，这种负面影响似乎主要来自最终产品。相比之下，与零部件相关的TBT对进口产生的积极效应要大于与最终产品相关的TBT。资源链接: HowTechnicalBarriers toTradeAffect Machinery Production Networks: Evidence from East Asia",

        "content": "There is increasing number of attacks aiming web servers; mostly at the application level. This is due to the fact that web services emerging rapidly without security considerations and network level solutions allow their connections tunnel through. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) can be configured to detect web attacks. These systems produce too many logs as they don’t have enough information about the network they are installed on. A prototype implementation of network-aware IDS is developed and its benefits are introduced.针对网络服务器的攻击日益增多，主要集中在应用层面。这主要是因为网络服务在快速发展时未充分考虑安全性，而网络层面的解决方案又允许其连接隧道穿透。入侵检测系统（IDS）可配置用于识别网络攻击，但由于缺乏对所部署网络的足够了解，这些系统会产生大量日志。本文开发了一种网络感知型IDS原型系统，并介绍了其优势。资源链接: Does Network Awareness Make Difference In IntrusionDetectionof Web Attacks",

        "content": "Technical textiles are rapidly creating new demand by replacing metals, ceramics and plastics with better-performing textiles featuring enhanced strength, heat resistance and elasticity through technological innovation. In particular, advanced technical textiles can augment value-added, not only through the price of the fiber itself but also through significant increases in value-added from the upstream to the downstream in the value chain.Accordingly, advanced countries are promoting technological development and expanding investment in order to take the lead in the advanced technical textile market, where new demand is rapidly expanding. On the other hand, advanced countries have designated high-performance fibers as export-approved items and are controlling the outflow of technology to latecomers.China is also rapidly chasing Korea, expanding its production capacity for advanced technical textiles while actively promoting its own technological development with continuous support from the government.For this reason, if Korea delays the technological development of advanced technical textiles in the future, or fails to establish an advanced technical textile production base, there are concerns not only of technological dependence on advanced countries but also market encroachment both overseas and at home by China.Therefore, in order to develop into a growing industry, overcoming the Chinese pursuit and pioneering the advanced technical textile market currently occupied by advanced countries, it is necessary to industrialize this next-generation growth engine by nurturing advanced technical textiles technologies. In addition, it is necessary to promote the structural advancement of the Korean textile industry by incubating advanced technical textiles that can meet global demand and create high value-added.To these ends, this study identifies crucial tasks for technical textile policies that help create high value-added and increase domestic and foreign demand for the sustainable growth and structural advancement of the Korean textile industry. This study also proposes measures to create a next-generation growth engine to strengthen global competitiveness and improve growth potential.技术纺织品正通过技术创新，以具备更强韧度、耐热性和弹性的高性能纺织品替代金属、陶瓷和塑料，快速创造新需求。特别是先进技术纺织品不仅能通过纤维本身的价格提升附加值，更能从价值链上游到下游实现附加值的显著增长。为此，发达国家正积极推进技术研发并扩大投资，以引领需求快速增长的先进技术纺织品市场。与此同时，发达国家将高性能纤维列为出口管制物品，严格控制技术向后来者外流。. . 中国也在政府持续支持下积极推动自主技术研发，不断扩大先进技术纺织品产能，正快速追赶韩国。若韩国在未来延迟先进技术纺织品的技术研发，或未能建立先进技术纺织品生产基地，不仅可能面临对发达国家的技术依赖，还可能遭遇中国在海外及本土市场的双重侵蚀。. . 因此，为将技术纺织品培育成增长型产业，既要突破中国的追赶，又要开拓目前由发达国家主导的先进技术纺织品市场，必须通过培育先进技术纺织品技术实现这一新一代增长动能的产业化。此外，需孵化能满足全球需求并创造高附加值的先进技术纺织品，推动韩国纺织业结构升级。. . 基于此，本研究明确了技术纺织品政策的核心任务——为促进韩国纺织业可持续增长和结构升级，需创造高附加值并扩大国内外需求。同时研究提出了打造新一代增长引擎的措施，以增强全球竞争力并提升增长潜力。资源链接: The Current State of the KoreanTechnicalTextile Industry and Tasks for Policy",

        "content": "Businesses are bombarded with great deals of risks, vulnerabilities, and unforeseen business interruptions in their lifetime, which negatively affect their productivity and sustainability within the market. Such risks require a risk management system to identify risks and risk factors and propose approaches to eliminate or reduce them. Risk management involves highly structured practices that should be implemented within an organization, including organizational planning documents. Continuity planning and fraud detection policy development are among the many critically important practices conducted through risk management that aim to mitigate risk factors, their vulnerability, and their impact. Information systems play a pivotal role in any organization by providing many benefits, such as reducing human errors and associated risks owing to the employment of sophisticated algorithms. Both the development and establishment of an information system within an organization contributes to mitigating business-related risks and also creates new types of risks associated with its establishment. Businesses must prepare for, react to, and recover from unprecedented threats that might emerge in the years or decades that follow. This paper provides a comprehensive narrative review of risk management in information systems coupled with its application in fraud detection and continuity planning.企业在存续期间会面临大量风险、漏洞和不可预见的业务中断，这些负面因素会削弱其生产力和市场可持续性。此类风险需要借助风险管理体系来识别风险因素，并提出消除或降低风险的解决方案。风险管理包含一系列高度结构化的实践措施，应通过组织规划文件等形式在企业内部落实。其中，业务连续性规划和反欺诈政策制定是风险管理的核心实践，旨在降低风险因素的脆弱性及其影响。信息系统通过运用复杂算法减少人为错误及相关风险，为各类组织提供关键支撑。但信息系统的开发建设在降低业务风险的同时，也会带来新型风险。企业必须为未来数十年可能出现的突发威胁做好预防、应对和恢复准备。本文系统综述了信息系统的风险管理及其在反欺诈和连续性规划中的应用。资源链接: A Review onRiskManagementin Information Systems:RiskPolicy, Control and Fraud Detection",

I first build a regulatory distance index, which measures the degree of dissimilarity in non-tariff measure structures between two trade partners. By including the regulatory distance index in a structural gravity model, I then find a significant negative effect of regulatory distance on total, backward, and forward global value chain-related trade. The negative impact is even more substantial when I restrict the analysis to manufacturing sectors. On the country dimension, I demonstrate that the effects of regulatory distance are associated with the exporters’ and the importers’ income levels.本文中，我评估了非关税措施政策异质性对各国全球价值链相关贸易及其后向与前向组成部分的影响。首先构建了一个监管距离指数，用于衡量两个贸易伙伴间非关税措施结构的差异程度。通过将该指数纳入结构引力模型，我发现监管距离对全球价值链相关总贸易、后向贸易和前向贸易均存在显著负面影响。当分析范围限定在制造业部门时，这种负面效应更为显著。在国家维度上，我证明了监管距离的影响与出口国和进口国的收入水平存在关联。资源链接: Regulatory Heterogeneity and Global Value Chain-RelatedTrade",

        "content": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are important for the transport of biologically active materials and function in intercellular communication. Amphibian skin is an exposed mucosa that participates in many important physiological processes. However, little is known about EVs in amphibian skin. Here, using the toad Bombina maxima as the research model, we successfully isolated EVs from skin secretions. These EVs, were characterized using nanoparticle tracking analysis, western blotting and electron microscopy. Proteomic analysis by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry identified 131 proteins in skin secretion-derived EVs, enriched in proteins related to immune stress, metabolism, oxidoreduction and transport based on their biological processes or molecular functions. The proteins in non-EVs (the proteins in Bombina maxima skin secretions that excepted EV) skin secretions were also analyzed, and 313 proteins were identified in these samples. Comparison of EV and non-EV proteins revealed that 62 proteins were unique to EVs, 244 proteins were unique to non-EVs, and 69 proteins were shared between EVs and non-EV secretions. Flow cytometry assay revealed that the isolated EVs could be taken up by B. maxima skin derived fibroblast cells. These findings provide the first evidence that EVs containing biologically active molecules are secreted from amphibian skin and can be taken up by amphibian skin cells, suggesting that EVs play important physiological roles in amphibian skin.细胞外囊泡（EVs）在生物活性物质的运输和细胞间通讯中发挥重要作用。两栖动物皮肤是一种暴露的黏膜组织，参与众多重要生理过程。然而，目前对两栖动物皮肤中EVs的认知仍十分有限。本研究以大蹼铃蟾为模型，成功从其皮肤分泌物中分离出EVs，并通过纳米颗粒追踪分析、蛋白质印迹和电子显微镜技术对其进行了表征。采用液相色谱-串联质谱法进行的蛋白质组学分析鉴定出131种皮肤分泌物来源EVs中的蛋白质，根据其生物过程或分子功能分类，这些蛋白质主要富集于免疫应激、代谢、氧化还原和运输等相关通路。同时分析了非EV组分（大蹼铃蟾皮肤分泌物中除EV外的蛋白质），鉴定出313种蛋白质。EV与非EV蛋白质的比较显示：62种蛋白质为EV特有，244种为非EV特有，69种为两者共有。流式细胞术检测表明，分离的EVs可被大蹼铃蟾皮肤源成纤维细胞摄取。这些发现首次证实两栖动物皮肤能分泌含有生物活性分子的EVs，且这些EVs可被皮肤细胞吸收，提示EVs在两栖动物皮肤中具有重要生理功能。资源链接: Proteomic raw data",

Київ, 2021.У дисертаційній роботі представлено результати дослідження проблеми розбудови кар’єри в торгівлі. Описано нові, отримані емпіричним шляхом наукові факти. На їх основі виокремлено та специфіковано психологічні чинники розбудови кар’єри в торгівлі.Основною метою дослідження стало виокремлення психологічних чинників розбудови кар’єри в торгівлі. Досягненню мети сприяло вирішення завдань, у межах яких: 1) висвітлено теоретичні аспекти проблеми розбудови кар’єри загалом та у сфері торгівлі; 2) виявлено зарплатні (кар’єрні) стереотипи в торгівлі; 3) досліджено ставлення студентів до проблеми розбудови кар’єри в торгівлі в тіньовій економіці; 4) представлено часові перспективи та кар’єрні амбіції студентів торговельного спрямування; 5) розроблено алгоритм психологічної допомоги у прийнятті кар’єрного рішення з урахуванням стереотипу сприйняття міжнародної спеціалізації як більш прибуткової; 6) розроблено алгоритм формування ставлення особи до проблеми розбудови кар’єри в тіньовій економіці України.Наукова новизна одержаних результатів полягає в тому, що вперше на основі встановлених наукових фактів створено класифікацію чинників розбудови кар’єри в торгівлі з виокремленням чинників розбудови кар’єри у формальній та неформальній (тіньовій) економіці України (1); а також створено другу класифікацію чинників з виокремленням особистісних та середовищних чинників на основі концепції поведінки за К. Левіним (2).У дисертаційній роботі було виявлено стереотип сприйняття міжнародної спеціалізації як більш прибуткової, на прикладі спеціалізації “Міжнародна торгівля” на противагу “Оптовій та роздрібній торгівлі”. Це дало підстави розробити алгоритм психологічної допомоги у прийнятті кар’єрного рішення з урахуванням стереотипу сприйняття міжнародної спеціалізації як більш прибуткової (3); розкрито особливості розбудови кар’єри в тіньовій економіці України, а саме: виявлено, що набуття підприємницького досвіду та прояв емпатії являються чинниками формування толерантного ставлення до несплати податків, а набуття правосвідомості навпаки є чинником протидії (4). Водночас продемонстровано вплив зміни атрибуції актора на ставлення студентів до розбудови кар’єри в торгівлі в тіньовій економіці України. Це дало підстави розробити алгоритм формування ставлення особи до проблеми розбудови кар’єри в тіньовій економіці України (5). У дисертаційній роботі набули подальшого розвитку наукові уявлення щодо феномену переживання завчасного професійного старіння студентської молоді (6).Наукові пошуки та здобутки висвітлено в чотирьох розділах дисертації. Загалом було проведено шість експериментальних та одне кореляційне дослідження, в яких сумарно 3693 студенти та 116 викладачів взяли участь.У першому розділі “Психологія кар’єри: теоретичні аспекти” розкрито питання множинності кар’єрних досліджень у вітчизняній та західній психології. У другому розділі “Зарплатні стереотипи в торгівлі” встановлено, що студенти, які навчаються на спеціалізаціях “Оптова та роздрібна торгівля” і “Міжнародна торгівля” мають стереотип, пов’язаний зі сприйняттям міжнародної спеціалізації як більш прибуткової. У третьому розділі “Психолого-правові аспекти кар’єри в торгівлі” визначено ставлення студентів Київського національного торговельно-економічного університету до проблеми розбудови кар’єри в тіньовій економіці. У четвертому розділі “Часові перспективи та кар’єрні амбіції студентів торговельного спрямування” встановлено, що часова перспектива є чинником розбудови кар’єри.На основі отриманих нами емпіричним шляхом наукових фактів у дисертаційній роботі виокремлено 18 чинників розбудови кар’єри в торгівлі: гендер, курс, навчальна успішність, спеціалізація, зайнятість, стереотип сприйняття міжнародної спеціалізації як більш прибуткової, зарплатні очікування, часова перспектива, впевненість у спроможності швидкого працевлаштування, впевненість у професійному виборі, амбіції закордонного навчання та працевлаштування, очікування кількості підлеглих та переваг отримання диплому магістра, зміна атрибуції актора, прояв емпатії та набуття підприємницького досвіду, як чинники формування толерантного ставлення до несплати податків, та правосвідомість, як чинник протидії.Виокремлені чинники розбудови кар’єри в торгівлі були класифіковані за відношенням до закону на дві групи: чинники розбудови кар’єри в формальній та неформальній (тіньовій) економіці України. В альтернативній авторській класифікації виокремлено особистісні та середовищні чинники розбудови кар’єри в торгівлі на основі концепції поведінки за К. Левіним.English Abstract:The dissertation is submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of the Doctor of Philosophy (Social and Behavioral Sciences, Specialty in “Psychology”) at the Kyiv National University of Trade and Economics. 2021.The dissertation describes research problems related to career development in trade. New empirically scientific facts are discussed presenting the psychological factors influencing career development in trade.The purpose of this study was to identify the psychological factors influencing career development in trade. The goal aims to achieve the following objectives:1) To describe the theoretical problem in the field of trade,2) To reveal salary stereotypes in trade,3) To study students’ attitude toward the problem of career development in trade in the Ukraine shadow economy,4) To present career ambitions and time perspectives of students specializing in trade,5) To develop a psychological assistance algorithm that facilitates career decision that considers the stereotype of perceiving international specialization as more profitable,6) To develop an algorithm that forms attitudes to the problem in career development in the Ukraine shadow economy.For the first time, this study presents a scientific novelty that focuses on the classification of career development in trade in both the formal and informal (shadow) economy of Ukraine) (1). For the first time, this study also presents a novel scientific insight that classifies career development factors in trade (personal and environmental factors based on Levin’s formula) (2). The thesis also reveals the stereotype of perceiving international specialization as more profitable. An algorithm is developed to correct this perception providing psychological assistance for making a career decision while considering the stereotype of perceiving international specialization as more profitable (3). In addition, the thesis reveals the peculiarities of career development in the Ukraine shadow economy. Entrepreneurial experience and empathy are factors influencing tax evasion, and the acquisition of legal awareness is a countermeasure (4). At the same time, this thesis demonstrated the influence of the change in the attribution of an actor (effect of neutral, first, and third perspectives) on the student attitude to the career trade development in the Ukraine shadow economy. In this regard, an algorithm was developed to form an attitude toward the problem of career development in the Ukraine shadow economy (5). The dissertation work further developed scientific ideas regarding the “feeling old” phenomena and career-building for young students (6).Four sections cover scientific research and achievements. Six experimental studies and one correlation study were conducted: 3693 students and 116 teachers participated. The dissertation is organized as follows:Chapter I discusses the theoretical aspects of career psychology and different studies focusing on career building in Ukrainian and Western psychology. Chapter 2 discusses “salary stereotypes in trade” considering the problem of perception of international specializations as more profitable. Chapter 3 discusses the “psychological and legal aspects of a career in trade” and defines the students’ attitude of the Kyiv National University of Trade and Economics to the problem of career development in the Ukraine shadow economy. Chapter 4 explores the “time perspectives and career ambitions of trade students”.Based on the empirical evidence obtained from scientific facts, 18 factors of career development in trade are identified: gender, course, grade point average, specialization, employment, the stereotype of perception of international specialization as more profitable, salary expectations, time perspective, career ambition to be hired quickly, confidence in professional choice, ambitions to study and work abroad, career expectations of the number of subordinates, the benefits of obtaining a master’s degree. Change in the attribution of the actor (an effect of neutral, first, and third perspectives), empathy, and entrepreneurial experience were factors to form a tolerant attitude to tax evasion; legal awareness has an opposite effect.From a law perspective, the resulting factors influencing career development in trade were classified into two groups: factors of career development in the 1) formal and 2) informal (shadow) economy of Ukraine. The alternative classification from Shatilova identified 1) personal and 2) environmental factors of career development in trade using Levin’s formula.英文摘要：本论文为申请哲学博士学位（社会与行为科学领域，心理学专业）提交的部分研究成果。基辅国立贸易与经济大学，2021年。. . 论文研究了贸易领域职业发展问题，呈现了通过实证研究获得的新科学事实，并据此提炼出影响贸易职业发展的心理因素。研究主要目标是识别贸易职业发展的心理因素，通过完成以下任务实现：1）阐述职业发展问题的理论层面；2）揭示贸易领域的薪资（职业）刻板印象；3）探究学生对乌克兰影子经济中贸易职业发展问题的态度；4）呈现贸易专业学生的时间观与职业抱负；5）开发考虑”国际专业更盈利”刻板印象的职业决策心理辅助算法；6）制定针对乌克兰影子经济职业发展问题的个人态度塑造算法。. . 科学创新体现在：首次建立包含乌克兰正式与非正式（影子）经济职业发展因素的分类体系（1）；基于勒温行为公式首创包含个人与环境因素的分类框架（2）。研究发现了”国际专业更盈利”的认知刻板印象（以”国际贸易”与”批发零售贸易”专业对比为例），据此开发了修正该刻板印象的职业决策辅助算法（3）；揭示了乌克兰影子经济中职业发展特征——创业经验与共情能力助长税收容忍度，而法律意识则起抑制作用（4）；证实了行动者归因变化对学生态度的影响，进而制定影子经济职业发展态度塑造算法（5）；深化了关于学生群体”过早职业老化”现象的研究（6）。. . 研究通过四章展开，包含6项实验和1项相关性研究，共涉及3693名学生和116名教师。第一章阐述职业心理学的理论基础；第二章揭示贸易专业学生存在的”国际专业更盈利”薪资刻板印象；第三章分析学生对影子经济中职业发展的态度；第四章证实时间观是职业发展影响因素。. . 通过实证研究最终确定18个贸易职业发展影响因素：性别、年级、学业成绩、专业方向、就业状况、”国际专业更盈利”刻板印象、薪资预期、时间观、快速就业信心、专业选择确信度、海外求学与就业抱负、下属数量预期、硕士学位收益预期、行动者归因变化、共情能力与创业经验（助长税收容忍度）及法律意识（抑制因素）。这些因素按法律属性分为正式与非正式（影子）经济两类，另按勒温公式划分为个人与环境因素。资源链接: Ph.D Thesis: Психологічні чинники розбудови кар’єри в торгівлі (Psychological Factors Influencing Career Development inTrade)",

        "content": "There are times when a forensic scientist may not be comfortable drawing a firm conclusion about whether a questioned sample that appears to contain useful identifying information did or did not come from a particular known source. In such cases, the forensic scientist may call the sample pair “inconclusive.”  We suggest that signal detection theory (SDT), which is concerned with the detection of weak signals in noisy environments, provides a useful framework for understanding the role that inconclusives play in the various feature-matching forensic sciences. SDT shows that “inconclusive” is often an appropriate response depending on both the strength of the signal in the samples and the thresholds adopted by the examiner. We also argue that inconclusives should not be coded as either correct or incorrect when tabulating forensic error rates.有时，法医科学家可能无法自信地就一个看似包含有用识别信息的待检样本是否来自特定已知来源得出明确结论。在这种情况下，法医科学家可能会将样本对标记为”无法确定”。我们认为信号检测理论（SDT）——该理论关注在嘈杂环境中检测微弱信号——为理解”无法确定”结论在各种特征匹配法证科学中的作用提供了有效框架。SDT表明，根据样本中信号强度及检验员设定的阈值，”无法确定”往往是恰当的回应。我们还主张在统计法证错误率时，不应将”无法确定”归类为正确或错误。资源链接: Inconclusives and Error Rates in Forensic Science: A SignalDetectionTheory Approach",

        "content": "Digital trade has become a major driver of economic development by enhancing productivity and lowering costs of trade in goods. While digital trade promises new opportunities for individuals and firms of all sizes, it also raises new challenges. Policymakers and business leaders need to better understand the drivers of this paradigm for trade and find solutions for potential issues in dialogue with stakeholders so as to ensure digital trade policies that are more sustainable and inclusive for all. This paper addresses emerging topics, with limited existing regulations in place and with clear challenges ahead in designing effective and appropriate policy responses that effectively address each topic. The risks of incompatible policy frameworks across the Asia-Pacific region cannot be discounted. Such regulatory fragmentation could destroy the promise of the digital economy and make it significantly harder for large and small firms across the region to participate in digital trade in the future.数字贸易通过提升生产效率和降低商品贸易成本，已成为经济发展的主要驱动力。尽管数字贸易为各类规模的企业和个人带来了新机遇，但也带来了新挑战。政策制定者和商业领袖需要更好地理解这一贸易模式的驱动因素，并与利益相关方共同探讨潜在问题的解决方案，以确保数字贸易政策更具可持续性和包容性。本文探讨了现有法规有限、且在制定有效且适当的政策应对措施方面面临明显挑战的新兴议题。亚太地区政策框架不兼容的风险不容忽视。这种监管碎片化可能会破坏数字经济的潜力，并大幅增加该地区大小企业未来参与数字贸易的难度。资源链接: DigitalTradein Asia",

        "content": "The unprecedented burden that the COVID-19 pandemic has placed on individuals and healthcare systems highlights the need for rapid, reliable diagnostic techniques and easy to procure biological matrices to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus. While saliva contains detectable levels of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in infected individuals, several molecular assays that detect SARS-CoV-2 do not include saliva as an approved sample. We evaluate saliva as a clinical sample in detecting SARS-CoV-2 on the Cepheid Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV reverse transcription PCR assay and assess how removal of cellular debris and mucus through centrifugation impacts the performance of SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva. We further compare sensitivity of uncentrifuged and centrifuged saliva samples by performing limit of detection testing in contrived samples. Cohen’s kappa statistic was 0.78 between the gold-standard, nasopharyngeal swabs in viral transport media (NP-VTM), and saliva indicating significant agreement in SARS-CoV-2 detection between the sample types. The positive percent agreement (PPA) between centrifuged saliva and NP-VTM samples was 0.92 compared to a PPA of 0.85 between uncentrifuged saliva and NP-VTM. In contrived samples, heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 was reliably detected at a concentration of 51,852 copies/mL in uncentrifuged saliva and 2,074 copies/mL in centrifuged saliva. Ct values increased less consistently in uncentrifuged saliva compared to centrifuged saliva, as indicated by the coefficient of Determination R-squared values of 0.92 and 0.54, respectively. Our study indicates that saliva is a viable clinical sample for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in a reverse transcription PCR assay and removal of cellular debris improves sample performance.COVID-19大流行给个人和医疗系统带来的空前压力，凸显了对快速可靠诊断技术及易于获取的生物样本以检测SARS-CoV-2病毒的需求。尽管感染者唾液中存在可检测水平的SARS-CoV-2病毒，但多项分子检测方法尚未将唾液列为获批样本。本研究评估了唾液作为临床样本在Cepheid Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV逆转录PCR检测中的表现，并探讨离心去除细胞碎片和粘液对唾液样本检测性能的影响。通过人工样本进行检测限测试，进一步比较了离心与非离心唾液样本的灵敏度。. . Cohen’s kappa统计量显示，金标准鼻咽拭子病毒转运培养基（NP-VTM）与唾液样本间的检测一致性为0.78，表明两种样本类型在SARS-CoV-2检测中具有显著一致性。离心唾液与NP-VTM样本的阳性符合率（PPA）达0.92，而非离心唾液与NP-VTM的PPA为0.85。在人工样本中，未离心唾液对热灭活SARS-CoV-2的可靠检测浓度为51,852拷贝/毫升，离心后唾液则提升至2,074拷贝/毫升。未离心唾液的Ct值增长稳定性低于离心样本，其判定系数R平方值分别为0.54和0.92。本研究表明唾液可作为逆转录PCR检测SARS-CoV-2的有效临床样本，且去除细胞碎片能显著提升样本性能。资源链接: Determining the Efficacy of Saliva in theDetectionof SARS-CoV-2 in a Molecular Assay Using Contrived and Clinical Samples ​",

        "content": "Recent years have seen the emergence of Existential Risk Studies (ERS), a rich field focused on understanding and mitigating a range of Extreme Technological Risks. This interdisciplinary and idiosyncratic field today finds itself at a crossroads: at the same time as many risks are growing increasingly urgent, there is increasing attention and potential to shape global action in response. The magnitude of both risks and opportunities create an urgent need for this field to reflect on how it defines itself going forward–as a community, as a science, and as a project pursuing change.Drawing on work from across the ERS field and beyond, as well as the authors’ personal experiences, this article seeks to spur and aid this process of reflection. To that end, we pose and discuss seven key questions for the ERS field. These are: (1) how can scholars of ERS choose which risks to prioritize? (2) How or why can we prioritize extreme technological risk over other global problems, and what are the possible downsides of ERS? (3) What are the different possible approaches to studying and managing ETRs? (4) In what ways can the field of ERS pursue a coherent scientific approach? (5) How can or should ERS pursue impact to mitigate ETRs? (6) How diverse is the field of ERS, and how can greater diversity aid the ERS field? (7) How can ERS best reflect on -and communicate about these questions, as it continues to grow?We do not provide definitive answers, but attempt to explore how and why different people might respond in different ways. We point to open debates around: disciplinary direction, pluralism, epistemic modesty, diversity, inclusion, representation and accountability. We take these challenges to be not just important but increasingly urgent, as pivotal considerations in charting a path forward for our field–and, perhaps, our world.近年来，生存风险研究（ERS）这一新兴领域逐渐兴起，它致力于理解和缓解一系列极端技术风险，成为一个内涵丰富的学科。这个跨学科且独具特色的领域如今正处在十字路口：一方面许多风险日益紧迫，另一方面全球应对行动的关注度与塑造潜力也在提升。风险与机遇的双重重要性迫切要求该领域从社群构成、科学定位到变革实践等维度重新审视自身发展方向。本文结合ERS领域内外研究成果及作者个人经验，旨在推动并辅助这一反思进程。为此我们提出并探讨了ERS领域的七个核心问题：（1）学者如何选择优先研究的风险类型？（2）为何应将极端技术风险置于其他全球问题之上？ERS可能存在哪些弊端？（3）研究与管理极端技术风险有哪些不同路径？（4）ERS领域如何建立连贯的科学方法论？（5）ERS应通过何种方式实现风险缓解的影响力？（6）该领域多样性现状如何？提升多样性有何裨益？（7）随着领域发展，ERS应如何有效反思并传播这些问题的探讨？. . 我们并未提供确定性答案，而是试图探究不同群体可能作出差异化回应的原因及方式。文中指出了若干开放性争议：学科方向、多元主义、认知谦逊、多样性、包容性、代表性与问责制。我们认为这些挑战不仅至关重要且日益紧迫，它们或将决定本领域——甚或整个人类社会——的未来发展轨迹。资源链接: Seven Questions for ExistentialRiskStudies",

        "content": "Supply chain risk management is the way of defining, assessing, and reducing risk in your entire supply chain. It involves management of all kinds of hazards, across all supply tiers, and across all hazard objects (suppliers, locations, ports and more). Because the supply chain industry is rapidly expanding, there is a need to identify potential weaknesses and internal inefficiencies in the organization and develop solutions to overcome them. Also, there is a need to monitor the company’s performance, to have a check on the progress of the company’s growth and check for any disruptions in the flow of the supply chain. Detecting and controlling risks has become an essential component of global supply networks. Machine learning techniques are used to discover risks in the system as well as to assist in identifying the source of the risk. After doing it, the company may attempt to optimize the source of the risk and, as a result, decrease the losses sustained as a result of it. Thus, to manage financial risks in the supply chain, a framework of risk detection models using machine learning is proposed. The main objective is to detect risks and identify its causes. The proposed model focus on three different hazard areas of a supply chain namely Transportation, Sales and Delivery and for each area, a risk detection model is trained and tested and compared with existing approaches and then tuned based on the results. Despite the specificity of the supply chain data used, the proposed system can be adapted to any other type of supply chain.供应链风险管理是对整个供应链中的风险进行定义、评估和降低的方法。它涉及对所有供应层级、所有危害对象（供应商、地点、港口等）中各类风险的管理。由于供应链行业正在迅速扩张，有必要识别组织内部的潜在弱点和低效问题，并制定解决方案加以克服。此外，还需要监控公司绩效，检查公司增长进度，并排查供应链流程中的任何中断。风险检测与控制已成为全球供应网络的重要组成部分。机器学习技术被用于发现系统中的风险，并协助识别风险来源。之后，公司可以尝试优化风险源头，从而减少由此造成的损失。因此，为管理供应链中的财务风险，本文提出了一种基于机器学习的风险检测模型框架，其主要目标是检测风险并识别其原因。所提出的模型聚焦于供应链中三个不同的风险领域：运输、销售和交付，针对每个领域分别训练和测试风险检测模型，与现有方法进行比较后根据结果进行调整。尽管所使用的供应链数据具有特定性，但该系统可适用于任何其他类型的供应链。资源链接: Supply Chain FinancialRiskManagement Using Business Intelligence",

        "content": "We develop a comprehensive list of paperless trade measures and provisions in regional trade agreements (RTAs) and examine the extent to which they are featured in various RTAs, including in the TPP and ASEAN agreements. The number of paperless trade measures in RTAs is found to have doubled between 2005-8 and 2013-16 at the global level. Most recent RTAs contain more and deeper provisions than those featured in the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement. A more detailed analysis of paperless trade measures included in selected Asia-Pacific RTAs confirms that the coverage of RTAs of paperless trade issues has become extensive, covering increasingly specific areas such as electronic certificates of origins and sanitary and phytosanitary certificates. In that context, the new UN treaty and Framework Agreement on Facilitation of Cross-Border Paperless Trade in Asia and the Pacific can be expected to provide a useful tool for harmonized implementation of many of these provisions.我们整理了一份区域贸易协定（RTAs）中无纸化贸易措施与条款的详尽清单，并考察了这些措施在各类RTA（包括TPP和东盟协定）中的体现程度。研究发现，全球范围内RTA中的无纸化贸易措施数量在2005-2008年与2013-2016年间翻了一番。最新签订的RTA大多包含比WTO《贸易便利化协定》更丰富、更深化的条款。对亚太地区部分RTA中无纸化贸易措施的细化分析表明，RTA对无纸化贸易议题的覆盖已非常广泛，涉及电子原产地证书、卫生与植物检疫证书等日益具体的领域。在此背景下，新出台的联合国《亚洲及太平洋跨境无纸贸易便利化框架协定》有望为协调实施这些条款提供有效工具。资源链接: PaperlessTradein RegionalTradeAgreements",

        "content": "This paper investigates the impact of internal control effectiveness (ICE) on the level of textual risk disclosure (TRD; including aggregate risk disclosure and its tone of good news and bad news about risk). Our findings suggest that firms with an ineffective internal control system exhibit significantly lower levels of TRD than firms with effective internal controls. Besides, we show a significant change in TRD behavior provided by managers of firms with recurrent ineffective internal controls. Pursuant to agency theory, this behavior change is prompted to reduce the expected public uncertainty and agency problems. We also investigate the usefulness of ICE reporting and TRD to the market. Results suggest that firms reporting ineffective internal controls are likely to have higher investor-perceived risk than firms reporting effective internal controls. Furthermore, TRD improves firms’ market liquidity, and such improvement is principally driven by good news rather than bad news about risk. Collectively, our results fill an apparent gap in the literature on the importance of ICE, as well as the usefulness of the external auditor’s attestation on a firm’s internal controls and management TRD.本文研究了内部控制有效性（ICE）对文本风险披露水平（TRD，包括总体风险披露及其关于风险的好消息和坏消息语气）的影响。研究发现，与内部控制有效的企业相比，内部控制无效企业的TRD水平显著较低。此外，我们发现内部控制反复无效的企业管理层会显著改变其TRD行为。根据代理理论，这种行为改变旨在降低预期的公众不确定性和代理问题。我们还探讨了ICE报告和TRD对市场的实用性。结果表明，与报告内部控制有效的企业相比，报告内部控制无效的企业可能面临更高的投资者感知风险。此外，TRD能提升企业的市场流动性，且这种改善主要源于关于风险的好消息而非坏消息。总体而言，我们的研究填补了现有文献关于ICE重要性、外部审计师对企业内部控制的鉴证作用以及管理层TRD实用性的明显空白。资源链接: InternalControlEffectiveness, TextualRiskDisclosure, and Their Usefulness: U.S. Evidence",

        "content": "Parasites can pose a risk to companion animals and potentially their owners. Current parasiticide use is possibly impacting the environment, increasing adverse reaction and resistance risk. As such parasiticides should be dispensed by the veterinary team proportional to individual risk, including owners in their approach. A mixed-methods questionnaire was designed and distributed using snowball sampling to ascertain overall understanding, observance, and attitude towards utilising a risk-based approach to parasite prophylaxis by UK companion animal veterinarians. 85.71% of veterinarians surveyed reported that they broadly understood risk-based parasite control whereas only 53.92% said they utilise it always or often. Significant correlations were found between more frequent risk-based parasite control utilisation and increased owner involvement (p&lt;= 0.0007) and prescription confidence (p= 0.0001). Most attitudes towards adopting risk-based control were positive. There was significant association with positive attitude and greater utilisation frequency (p= 0.0010), as well as working in corporate practice (p= 0.0126). Understanding risk-based parasite control has potential to increase responsible utilisation of parasiticides by veterinarians, and therefore mitigate risks associated. Most veterinarians would like to see the profession move towards risk-based control use, but institutional changes are required. Further research, and education is also needed.寄生虫可能对伴侣动物及其主人构成威胁。当前驱虫药的使用可能正在影响环境，增加不良反应和耐药性风险。因此，兽医团队应根据个体风险（包括主人因素）按比例分配驱虫药。本研究采用混合方法问卷设计，通过滚雪球抽样分发，以评估英国伴侣动物兽医对基于风险的寄生虫预防方法的整体理解、实践情况及态度。85.71%的受访兽医表示基本理解基于风险的寄生虫防控，但仅53.92%表示总是或经常采用该方法。研究发现，更频繁采用基于风险防控与加强主人参与度（p≤0.0007）及处方信心（p=0.0001）存在显著相关性。多数兽医对采用该防控方法持积极态度，积极态度与更高使用频率（p=0.0010）及在连锁诊所工作（p=0.0126）显著相关。理解基于风险的防控有望促进兽医更负责任地使用驱虫药，从而降低相关风险。多数兽医希望行业转向基于风险的防控，但需进行制度性变革，同时需要进一步研究和教育支持。资源链接: Perception of UK Companion Animal Veterinarians onRisk-Based ParasiteControl",

Following the paper [3] on the model risk of the Sensitivity Based Method, this paper investigates the performance of the Residual Risk Add-On in terms of identification, measurement and control of the residual risks, and finds that there exist arguments on the clarity of the criteria for instruments subject to residual risks and Residual Risk Add-On may significantly underestimate or overestimate the residual risks. The control for the Residual Risk Add-On program can be enhanced with some proposals to achieve optimal market risk management, especially for institutions which will not implement the Internal Model Method.作为《交易账户基本审查标准化方法》的第三部分[1]，剩余风险附加项旨在捕捉其他两个组成部分（基于敏感度的方法和违约风险费用）未覆盖的风险，并在此前的市场风险框架中承担”未纳入VaR计划的风险”或”未纳入模型引擎的风险”角色[2]。继关于基于敏感度方法模型风险的论文[3]之后，本文研究了剩余风险附加项在剩余风险识别、计量和控制方面的表现，发现对于适用剩余风险工具的判定标准清晰度存在争议，且剩余风险附加项可能显著低估或高估剩余风险。通过若干优化建议可加强剩余风险附加项计划的控制效果，以实现最优市场风险管理，尤其对不采用内部模型法的机构具有特殊意义。资源链接: ModelRiskof FRTB Standardized Approach: II.

In this regard, we present a fast and simple electrochemical method of detecting di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) from the river water samples using a phthalic acid group specific aptamer modified on a gold nanoparticle (AuNP) functionalized graphene oxide nano-platelets (GO) and ionic liquid (IL) nanocomposite. Here, the IL/GO nanocomposite provides for an enhanced interaction with the phthalate esters thereby increasing the sensitivity of the sensor surface. The proposed sensor showed a wide linear dynamic range of 0.14 pg/mL to 0.35 ng/mL and 0.35 ng/mL to 7 ng/mL with the detection limit of ≤0.042 pg/mL, which were evaluated using standard, analytical grade DBP; the limit of quantification was determined using different concentrations of DBP in DI water with comparison to GC/MS. The proposed sensor was used to monitor the DBP concentrations in river water samples collected from various locations across South Korea. The quantitative data from the measurements in comparison with standard GC/MS, were then used to ascertain the human health risk posed by the daily consumption of these river waters.快速检测污染物以实现对环境危害的灵敏定量监测，是规避人类健康风险的关键第一步。为此，我们开发了一种基于邻苯二甲酸基团特异性适配体的电化学方法，该方法利用金纳米颗粒（AuNP）功能化氧化石墨烯纳米片（GO）与离子液体（IL）纳米复合材料，可简便快速地检测河水样本中的邻苯二甲酸二丁酯（DBP）。该IL/GO纳米复合材料能增强与邻苯二甲酸酯类物质的相互作用，从而提升传感器表面的灵敏度。所构建传感器在0.14皮克/毫升至0.35纳克/毫升和0.35纳克/毫升至7纳克/毫升范围内呈现宽线性动态区间，检测限≤0.042皮克/毫升（采用分析级标准DBP评估），定量限则通过对比GC/MS测定不同浓度DBP去离子水溶液确定。应用该传感器对韩国多地采集的河水样本进行DBP浓度监测，并将测量数据与标准GC/MS结果对比，进而评估日常饮用这些河水的潜在健康风险。资源链接: A Simple Ultrasensitive ElectrochemicalDetectionof Dbp Plasticizer for theRiskAssessment of the South Korean River Water",

Examining the EU’s geographical indications regime for wines, this article considers the question of when a World Trade Organization member’s measures taken to implement the TRIPS Agreement might contravene the member’s obligations under the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement). A technical regulation apparently permitted by the TRIPS Agreement may be inconsistent with the TBT Agreement where it does not in good faith pursue a legitimate objective or where it is incongruent with or poorly calibrated to its objective. In particular, the compatibility with the TBT Agreement of EU regulations that prohibit the labelling of wines with the relevant grape variety where the variety ‘contains or consists of’, ‘evokes’ or ‘forms an integral part of’ a GI is open to doubt.《与贸易有关的知识产权协定》（TRIPS协定）为知识产权保护设定了下限而非上限。本文通过考察欧盟葡萄酒地理标志保护制度，探讨了世贸组织成员为实施TRIPS协定而采取的措施在何种情形下可能违反其在《技术性贸易壁垒协定》（TBT协定）下的义务。一项表面符合TRIPS协定的技术法规，若未真诚追求合法目标，或与其目标不相称、匹配失当，则可能与TBT协定相抵触。特别是欧盟禁止在葡萄酒标签上使用”包含或构成”、”暗示”或”构成组成部分”地理标志的葡萄品种名称之规定，其与TBT协定的兼容性值得商榷。资源链接: The Compatibility of the EU’s Geographical Indications Regulations for Wines with the WTO Agreement onTechnicalBarriers toTrade",

        "content": "Under Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act Section 302, management should, from one hand, certify and disclose in reports the effectiveness of internal controls applied to processes and procedures followed by a listed entity and, on the other, highlight potential deficiencies and provide information on potential frauds or sources of risk that could negatively impact on the effectiveness of the internal controls in place. Building on the above, SOX Act Section 404 requires thatmanagement should report information in its annual reports regarding the adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal controls, which affects the procedures of financial reporting. These internal control reports, as part of the internal audit system within an organization, they undergo a review initially by the internal audit department and then by external auditors. The external auditors’ comments may dictate certain changes to be made, which could inevitably lead to refinements, which are then depicted to the adjusted internal control reports. The need for restatements of internal control reports is definitely associated with additional workfrom the side of the external auditor and may initiate more extensive audit work. Hence, the aim of the particular study is to investigate to what extent the audit fees paid to external auditors(i.e. the audit firm) are affected by such restatements to the internal control reports and whether the entity’s earnings and book value of equity have a mediating role to the above relationship. The innovativeness of the current research lies at the fact that it is the first time that a research focuses on “Restatements of Internal Control Reports” (RICR) and “Firm’s Earnings” (FE) as significant determinants of “Audit Fees” (AF) paid to external auditors, providing materially useful evidence about the behavioral profile of audit firms concerning their pricing strategy. Employing a datasetthat captures the period before and during the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, we use RICR as control variable to assess not only the effectiveness of internal controls, but also the performanceof the selected financial institutions and to what extent do the above influence the pricing strategy adopted by audit firms. In methodological terms, we apply Multiple Regression Analysis to a data set that consists of 2.878 observations, which stem from 300 US financial institutions and are recorded for a period of seven years that range from 2004 to 2010. The selection of the specificperiod facilitates comparisons between the period before and during global financial crisis. These findings are then contrasted with the results that cover the whole 2004-2010 period根据《萨班斯-奥克斯利法案》第302条款，管理层一方面需在报告中认证并披露上市公司流程与程序所适用内部控制的有效性，另一方面须指出潜在缺陷，并提供可能影响现有内部控制有效性的舞弊或风险来源信息。在此基础上，该法案第404条款进一步要求管理层在年度报告中报告影响财务报告程序的内部控制体系的充分性与有效性。这些作为组织内部审计体系组成部分的内部控制报告，需先后接受内部审计部门和外部审计师的审查。外部审计师的意见可能导致必要的修订，这些调整最终将体现在修改后的内部控制报告中。内部控制报告的重述必然增加外部审计师的工作量，并可能引发更广泛的审计工作。因此，本研究旨在探究内部控制报告重述在多大程度上影响支付给外部审计师（即会计师事务所）的审计费用，以及企业盈利和权益账面价值是否对上述关系具有中介作用。本研究的创新性在于首次将”内部控制报告重述”（RICR）与”企业盈利”（FE）作为支付给外部审计师的”审计费用”（AF）的重要决定因素进行研究，为审计机构定价策略的行为特征提供了具有实质意义的证据。通过采用涵盖2007-2008年全球金融危机前后时期的数据集，我们以RICR作为控制变量，不仅评估了内部控制有效性，还考察了所选金融机构的绩效及其对审计机构定价策略的影响程度。在方法论层面，我们对来自300家美国金融机构、时间跨度为2004至2010年（共七年）的2,878条观测数据进行了多元回归分析。这一特定时期的选择有助于比较全球金融危机前后的差异，研究结果将与2004-2010整个时期的数据结论进行对比。资源链接: Audit fees and pricing strategy: Do restatements of internalcontrolreports and earnings matter",

        "content": "Capital account liberalization is generally beneficial to developing and emerging countries. However, if there is a downside risk in one country, capital control policy can prevent it from exposing to carry trade flows and capital flight, and protect it from external financial volatility. In this paper, we study the marginal effects of different types of China’s capital control indices on GDP growth distribution and the term structure of such distribution using quantile regressions with local projections and fitted skewed t-distribution. We find that: (i) there are heterogeneous effects of China’s capital control policies on GDP growth distribution: the aggregated capital control indices are beneficial in reducing the downside risk of real GDP growth in medium term whereas they are costly on the upswings of real GDP growth in near-term; (ii) the marginal effects of capital control indices on GDP growth over quantiles show that the heterogeneous effects are stronger in near-term than medium term; (iii) specifically, these heterogeneous effects are more evident in short term for outflow control index and resident transaction control index; (iv) the granular capital control indices show broadly heterogeneous effects even if several of them are statistically insignificant.资本账户开放通常对发展中国家和新兴国家有利。然而，若一国存在下行风险，资本管制政策可防止其暴露于利差交易流动和资本外逃，并保护其免受外部金融波动影响。本文通过结合局部投影的分位数回归与拟合偏态t分布，研究了中国各类资本管制指标对GDP增长分布及其期限结构的边际效应。研究发现：（一）中国资本管制政策对GDP增长分布存在异质性影响：综合资本管制指标有助于降低中期实际GDP增长的下行风险，但会在短期内抑制实际GDP增长的上升空间；（二）资本管制指标对GDP增长分位数的边际效应表明，这种异质性影响在短期内比中期更为显著；（三）具体而言，流出管制指标和居民交易管制指标的异质性效应在短期更为明显；（四）细分资本管制指标普遍呈现异质性影响，尽管部分指标在统计上不显著。资源链接: Benefits and Costs: The Impact of CapitalControlon Growth-at-Riskin China",

This paper examines whether discrepancies observed in the official trade statistics of importing and exporting countries are partly due to trade fraud associated with evading border NTMs. To capture the restrictiveness of NTMs, this paper estimates the ad valorem equivalent (AVE) with importer-exporter-product variations. This paper presents a theoretical model and empirical evidence showing that discrepancies increase with AVEs, consistent with the trade fraud due to traders intentionally mis-declaring countries of origin and product classifications in order to evade border NTMs. The results are driven by homogeneous products and the trade between developed and developing countries.与关税类似，非关税措施（NTMs）若具有限制性，也可能诱发贸易欺诈。本文研究进口国与出口国官方贸易统计数据间的差异是否部分源于逃避边境非关税措施的贸易欺诈行为。为量化非关税措施的限制程度，本文采用进口方-出口方-产品三维变量估算了从价等值税率（AVE）。通过理论模型与实证分析，本文证明统计差异会随AVE值上升而扩大，这与贸易商为规避边境非关税措施而故意虚报原产国和商品分类的欺诈行为特征相符。该现象主要由同质化产品及发达国家与发展中国家之间的贸易所驱动。资源链接: TradeFraud and Non-TariffMeasures",

        "tags": "intellectual property  trade in knowledge  digital trade  TRIPS Agreement ",
        "content": "This paper charts the evolution and diversification of trade in knowledge that has taken place in the quarter-century since the WTO TRIPS Agreement came into force. Entirely new markets have come into being, potentially redefining the very character of ‘trade’. The disruptive effect of digital technology has led to much of the content - formerly conceived of as ‘added value’ embedded in physical carrier media, traded and measured as ‘goods’ – can be traded in the form of specific licences that use IP rights covering the content that is increasingly accessed online in digital form.These new forms of exchange in valuable intangible content confront fundamental assumptions about the nature of trade and its interaction with the IP system, forcing a rethink of what constitutes the ‘trade-related aspects’ of intellectual property. The issues examined include the principle of territoriality of IP rights and the segmentation of markets according to national jurisdictions; the structuring of cross-border commercial exchanges into the two discrete categories of ‘goods’ and ‘services’; the emerging disparity in regional trade agreements between provisions on digital IP standards and on digital products and e-commerce; and the significance of IP rights being treated as assets in investment treaties. Whatever formal or legal overlay is applied to these new trading arrangements – it is essential to understand that this is now trade in IP licences as such, rather than trade in goods that have an IP component as an adjunct or ancillary element. TRIPS came about at a time when economic growth theory incorporated intangible knowledge as an endogenous factor, rather than maintaining it as exogenous to models of growth. Trade policy must similarly work to incorporate an understanding of the trade in IP licences itself within cross-border commercial exchanges as an integral element of international trading relations: sale and licensing of IP rights can then be considered ‘endogenous’ to trade. This is essential for an accurate empirical picture of trade relations today, given the economic significance both of dispersed global value chains and of trade in ‘pure’ IP content as such particularly in the creative sectors.本文追溯了自WTO《与贸易有关的知识产权协定》(TRIPS)生效二十五年来，知识贸易的演变与多元化进程。全新市场的诞生正在重新定义”贸易”的本质特征。数字技术的颠覆性影响使得大量内容——传统上被视为嵌入实体载体媒介的”附加值”，以”货物”形式进行贸易和计量——现在可以通过特定许可形式进行交易，这些许可利用的正是日益以数字化形式在线获取的内容所涉及的知识产权。这些无形高价值内容的新型交易方式，对贸易本质及其与知识产权体系互动的基本假设提出了挑战，迫使人们重新思考知识产权的”与贸易相关的方面”究竟包含哪些要素。. . 研究涉及的问题包括：知识产权地域性原则与按国家司法辖区划分的市场分割；将跨境商业交换机械划分为”货物”和”服务”两大类的结构性问题；区域贸易协定中数字知识产权标准条款与数字产品及电子商务条款之间日益显现的差异；以及知识产权在投资条约中被视为资产的重要意义。无论对这些新型贸易安排施加何种形式或法律层面的规范——关键在于认识到这本质上已是知识产权许可本身的贸易，而非附带知识产权成分的货物贸易。TRIPS协定诞生时，经济增长理论正将无形知识作为内生因素纳入，而非继续将其视为增长模型的外生变量。贸易政策同样需要将知识产权许可贸易本身作为跨境商业交换的内在要素纳入国际经贸关系：知识产权的销售与许可由此可被视为贸易的”内生”组成部分。鉴于全球价值链的分散分布与”纯”知识产权内容贸易（尤其在创意产业领域）的经济重要性，这种认知对准确描绘当今贸易关系的实证图景至关重要。资源链接: The Shifting Contours ofTradein Knowledge: The New ‘Trade-Related Aspects’ of Intellectual Property",

        "content": "We consider the case of a non-infinitely-altruistic social planner who does not know the true climate and economic parameters of the DICE model and who, because of political or social constraints, cannot act optimally. We find that the impact of parameter uncertainty on economic outcomes is much more pronounced away from optimality than along an optimal path. We also find that for this non-omniscient and politically constrained social planner the most desirable of the feasible' courses of actions depends strongly on which quantity is known with uncertainty. A gradual ramp-up is preferred to a steep (Stern-like’) abatement schedule when we consider (symmetric) uncertainty in the growth rate of the economy, or in the cost of abatement. This result is extremely robust to the choice of a number of non-expected-utility-maximization decisional criteria that do not make use of probabilities: minimax, maximax and maximin all give the same recommendation. Ambiguity aversion does not change these results. However, when uncertainty in the damage function is considered, a steeper abatement schedule becomes a strong contender, and is preferred by some decisional criteria. This suggests that researching this aspect of climate modelling would have the greatest policy relevance. Finally, we note that a gradual (Nordhaus-like') ramp-up of the abatement efforts abatement schedule is always preferred to a slower (business-as-usual’) schedule of abatement even in the case of much stronger future economic growth or much milder climate damage than the central estimates of the DICE model.我们研究了一个非无限利他主义的社会规划者的情况，该规划者不了解DICE模型中真实的气候和经济参数，并且由于政治或社会约束无法采取最优行动。我们发现，参数不确定性对经济结果的影响在偏离最优路径时远比沿最优路径时更为显著。我们还发现，对于这个非全知且受政治约束的社会规划者而言，”可行”行动方案中最理想的选择在很大程度上取决于哪些量存在不确定性。当考虑经济增长率或减排成本的（对称）不确定性时，渐进式减排方案比陡峭的（”斯特恩式”）减排时间表更受青睐。这一结果对于多种不依赖概率的非期望效用最大化决策准则的选择具有极强的稳健性：极小化极大、极大化极大和极大化极小准则都给出了相同的建议。模糊厌恶也不会改变这些结论。然而，当考虑损害函数的不确定性时，更陡峭的减排方案成为强有力的竞争者，并被某些决策准则所偏好。这表明研究气候建模的这一方面将具有最大的政策相关性。最后我们注意到，即使未来经济增长远高于DICE模型的核心预测值或气候损害远低于预期，渐进式（”诺德豪斯式”）的减排努力时间表始终优于缓慢的（”一切照旧”）减排方案。资源链接: Which Abatement Policies Are Best Away from Optimality?",

These findings highlight that digital trade determinants play different roles for goods and services: the internet is beneficial for goods trade but critical for services. Finally, using a general equilibrium model of trade, we assess the trade and welfare impacts of increased internet connectivity in developing countries and find that increases in internet use can have large positive impacts on poorly connected countries. However, it also highlights the danger of developing countries falling behind as the digital economy continues to grow.我们评估了互联网连接和数字贸易政策对贸易与福利的影响。通过采用双边互联网连接指标，我们发现互联网与商品及服务的国内国际贸易（包括集约边际和扩展边际）均存在显著正向关联。研究还表明，贸易协定中的数字贸易便利化条款显著促进了服务贸易，但对商品贸易影响有限。这些发现凸显出数字贸易决定因素对商品和服务具有不同作用：互联网对商品贸易有益，但对服务贸易至关重要。最后，我们运用贸易一般均衡模型评估了发展中国家提升互联网连接度对贸易和福利的影响，发现互联网使用率的提升能为网络基础设施薄弱的国家带来巨大积极影响。但研究也警示，随着数字经济持续发展，发展中国家存在进一步落后的风险。资源链接: Trade, Policy, and Economic Development in the Digital Economy",

This article illustrates the impact of noise on credit ratings and shows how their suggestions for conducting a noise audit, ensuring noise hygiene, and subsequent reduction of noise can be applied to credit risk ratings. The validity of credit risk ratings can improve from the perspective of these findings. All areas of credit risk management including credit underwriting, loan review, and credit audit would benefit.长期以来，行为经济学一直是研究人们如何做出判断性决策的重要领域。虽然偏见的影响通常可以得到纠正，但更难识别和纠正的是所谓的”噪声”。正如卡尼曼等人在《噪声：人类判断的缺陷》中所阐述的，研究表明，一天中的时间、室外温度、个人情绪、过度纠正的欲望以及简单的随机性，都可能是人们做出判断性预测和评估背后的原因。本文阐述了噪声对信用评级的影响，并展示了如何将他们对进行噪声审计、确保噪声卫生以及随后减少噪声的建议应用于信用风险评级。从这些发现的角度来看，信用风险评级的有效性可以得到提高。信用风险管理的所有领域，包括信贷承销、贷款审查和信用审计，都将从中受益。资源链接: CreditRiskRatings and Noise",

        "content": "The Internet’s potential to enable micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to conduct international commercial transactions has yet to be fully realised. Small enterprises, especially MSMEs based in developing countries, continue to face substantial obstacles to their participation in trade. While ‘International Economic Law’ has evolved amidst rapid globalisation and technological change, developing countries’ MSMEs are frequently unable to achieve the benefits associated with trade liberalisation. As ‘new generation’ agreements introduce further legal complexity in both the number and scope of trade rules, this article investigates Chile’s application of information and communications technology (ICT) to improve the accessibility and functionality of commercial policies. With an emphasis on computational approaches to trade policy design and delivery, the Undersecretary of International Economic Relations (SUBREI) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Chile has launched a pilot programme to contribute to an open repository of rules in a digital form: ‘An Internet of Rules’ (IoR). Along with reference data, the computational expression and online publication of rules, that may be ‘in effect’ or ‘applicable’ to cross-border transactions, can improve access and use by people and machines alike. Against the backdrop of the country’s history of reform and membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (CPTPP), and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA), the investigation articulates Chile’s ongoing contribution to an IoR as well as the alignment of its policy digitalisation efforts with national development strategies.互联网在帮助微型、中小型企业（MSMEs）开展国际商业交易方面的潜力尚未得到充分发挥。小型企业，尤其是发展中国家的微型、中小型企业，在参与贸易时仍面临重大障碍。尽管”国际经济法”在快速全球化和技术变革中不断发展，但发展中国家的微型、中小型企业往往无法享受到贸易自由化带来的好处。随着”新一代”协议在贸易规则的数量和范围上进一步增加了法律复杂性，本文研究了智利如何应用信息和通信技术（ICT）来提高商业政策的可及性和功能性。智利外交部国际经济关系副部长办公室（SUBREI）重点采用计算方法来设计和实施贸易政策，已启动一个试点项目，旨在建立一个开放的数字化规则库：”规则互联网”（IoR）。通过参考数据以及规则的计算机化表达和在线发布，这些规则可能”有效”或”适用于”跨境交易，从而改善人和机器对规则的访问和使用。在智利改革历史以及其作为世界贸易组织（WTO）、《全面与进步跨太平洋伙伴关系协定》（CPTPP）和《数字经济伙伴关系协定》（DEPA）成员的背景下，本研究阐述了智利对”规则互联网”的持续贡献，以及其政策数字化工作与国家发展战略的一致性。资源链接: Augmenting MSME Participation inTradewith Policy Digitalisation Efforts: Chile’s Contribution to ‘An Internet of Rules’",

        "content": "Introduction: Intra-African Trade has been covered in various studies focusing on all African trade blocks. Trade is critical to the success of many sectors of most developed countries. Intra-African Trade in the EAC has been deemed as a positive contributing factor towards enhancing economic benefits between Uganda and Kenya. Currently the settlement of the sugar pact between Kenya and Uganda aims at improving the regionalism of the two countries in East Africa (EAC) but still there are several disadvantages as there are advantages to the western region millers in Kenya. Though there are several issues that arise in different products within any Intra-African trades to explain the same in relation to the Kenya-Uganda Sugar Pact and its impact on Western Region Sugar Millers in Kenya. This brings up the discussion on whether the sugar pact will positively or negatively affects sugarcane farmers in Kenyan region.Objectives: The objectives of the study were to first assess the impact of the Kenya-Uganda Sugar Pact on small holder sugarcane farmers. To secondly identify the impact of the Kenya-Uganda Sugar Pact on socio-economic development. Thirdly to examine the impact of the Kenya-Uganda Sugar Pact on sugar companies. Fourthly to determine interventions and alternatives to address challenges brought about by the Kenya-Uganda Sugar pact in Western Region in Kenya.Study Design: A case study research design.Study Area: Nzoia Sugar Company in Western Region in Kenya.Data Collection Tools and Procedures: Interview guides and questionnaire were used to collect data.Data Analysis: Qualitative and quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics included percentage tables. The study findings were interpreted to show the perception of the respondent on issues raised in the questionnaires to answer the research questions.Results: 41 percent of respondents stated smallholder farmers will lack protection to ensure food security and decent earnings from their produce. 53 percent gave the opinion that it will lead to slow growth due to slow rate of pay on time done by sugar cane suppliers. Another 41 percent agreed that the companies will suffer from recovery especially if sugar produced is not excessively sold and thus leading to companies shutting down. Finally, 51 percent were of the opinion that the government needs to regulate the amount of sugar imported to Kenya in the sugar pact between Kenya and Uganda.引言：关于非洲内部贸易的各类研究已覆盖所有非洲贸易区块。贸易对多数发达国家众多领域的成功至关重要。东非共同体（EAC）框架下的非洲内部贸易被视为增强乌干达与肯尼亚经济互利的积极因素。当前肯尼亚与乌干达达成的食糖协议旨在提升两国在东非地区的区域一体化，但对肯尼亚西部地区的糖厂而言，其优势与劣势并存。尽管非洲内部贸易中不同商品会引发诸多问题，本研究将聚焦肯乌食糖协议及其对肯尼亚西部地区糖厂的影响，由此引发关于该协议对肯尼亚蔗农影响的利弊讨论。. . 研究目标：本研究首先评估肯乌食糖协议对小规模蔗农的影响；其次识别该协议对社会经济发展的影响；再次考察其对糖业公司的影响；最后提出应对肯尼亚西部地区因该协议所面临挑战的干预措施与替代方案。. . 研究设计：采用案例研究设计。. . 研究区域：肯尼亚西部地区的恩佐亚糖业公司。. . 数据收集工具与方法：运用访谈提纲与问卷调查收集数据。. . 数据分析：通过描述性统计（含百分比表格）分析定性与定量数据，研究结果用于阐释受访者对问卷所提问题的看法以解答研究问题。. . 研究结果：41%受访者认为小农户将缺乏保障机制以确保粮食安全与作物合理收益；53%指出因甘蔗供应商付款延迟将导致增长放缓；另有41%认同糖企将面临经营困难——若食糖滞销甚至会导致企业倒闭；最终51%受访者主张政府需调控肯乌食糖协议中的进口糖数量。资源链接: Intra-African Trade: assessing the Kenya and Uganda sugar pact and its impact on Western Region Sugar Millers in Kenya",

        "content": "Australia declared services trade liberalisation in Australia-European Union Free Trade Agreement (AUEFTA) negotiations a priority, while an impact assessment by the EU indicated no measurable impact on sectoral output for services in an AEUFTA in services. The two sides will not only have to agree on the relative importance of the services chapter, but also on the type of regulatory structure pursued. At this point, the outcome of negotiations remains unknown. While some elements of substantial liberalisation are expected in the liberalisation of trade in professional services along with temporary movement of persons, and in education services, the currently proposed regulatory structure of the AEUFTA service chapter suggests limited regulatory innovation. However, both parties have confirmed their intention to deepen liberalisation within the scope of their respective schedule of commitments beyond their Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) offers in 2016. Given that both parties have furthermore confirmed their commitment to modernisation and deepening of international rules in services trade liberalisation in the plurilateral forum of TiSA negotiations, the AEUFTA service chapter may therefore serve also as a stepping-stone to subsequent successful conclusion of plurilateral TiSA negotiations.澳大利亚将澳欧自由贸易协定（AUEFTA）谈判中的服务贸易自由化列为优先事项，而欧盟的一项影响评估显示，该协定对服务业的部门产出无显著影响。双方不仅需就服务章节的相对重要性达成共识，还需协调监管框架的类型。目前谈判结果尚不明朗。尽管专业服务贸易及人员临时流动、教育服务领域有望实现实质性自由化，但现行AUEFTA服务章节的监管框架设计显示制度创新有限。不过，双方已确认将在各自承诺表范围内推进比2016年《服务贸易协定》（TiSA）出价更深入的开放。鉴于两国还承诺在TiSA多边谈判论坛中推动服务贸易自由化规则的现代化与深化，AUEFTA服务章节或将成为后续成功完成TiSA多边谈判的基石。资源链接: ServicesTradeLiberalisation in the Australia – EU FTA: Progress but no Quantum-Leap",

        "content": "The Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations aim to solve social, economic and environmental development problems in an integrated manner during the period from 2015 to 2030. The 13th SDG is to “Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”, concerning sub-goal 13.1 “Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate related hazards and disasters in all countries”. SDG13.1.1 has been defined to be a specific, effective indicator that can be used to quantitatively monitor and evaluate governments’ response to climate change. It is defined as the “number of deaths, missing persons and directly affected persons attributed to disasters per 100,000 population”. The EM-DAT contains important core data on the occurrence and impact of more than 220,000 large-scale disasters worldwide from 1900 to the present. As a global disaster database, the EM-DAT provides a large amount of natural and technological disaster data for international projects and scientific research. By making use of the EM-DAT big data and SGD13.1.1 indicators, it is possible to quantify disaster information at a large geographical scale and to conduct valuable disaster assessments of different countries and regions, as well as to improve the monitoring and assessment of disaster risk reduction capabilities, and strengthen the ability of countries to adapt to, resist, and reduce extreme disasters caused by climate change. In our related paper “Disaster Assessment for the “Belt and Road” Region based on SDG landmarks”, disaster assessment for the ‘Belt and Road’ region was carried out in relation to the SGD13.1.1 indicator, based on the EM-DAT (The Emergency Events Database) database. A new method for diagnosing trends in SGD13.1.1 was proposed, and an overview of disaster records is used to quantify disasters for a total of 73 countries using the data available in the EM-DAT. The following data are supplementary materials for this article,including:the calculation variables of the SDG13.1.1 indicator;disaster types of each country in the whole Belt and Road region; calulated SDG13.1.1 value and trend values of each country in the Belt and Road countries.联合国制定的可持续发展目标旨在2015至2030年间综合解决社会、经济和环境发展问题。其中第13项目标是”采取紧急行动应对气候变化及其影响”，具体涉及子目标13.1”加强各国抵御和适应气候相关灾害的能力”。SDG13.1.1被定义为可量化监测评估政府应对气候变化成效的具体指标，其内容为”每10万人中因灾害致死的失踪及直接受影响人数”。EM-DAT数据库收录了1900年至今全球超过22万起重大灾害事件的核心数据，作为国际灾害数据库为各类国际项目和科研提供大量自然与技术灾害数据。利用EM-DAT大数据和SGD13.1.1指标，可在宏观地理尺度量化灾害信息，对”一带一路”沿线国家开展有价值的灾害评估，同时提升减灾能力监测评估水平，增强各国适应、抵御和降低气候变化所致极端灾害的能力。我们在关联论文《基于SDG标志物的”一带一路”区域灾害评估》中，依托EM-DAT应急事件数据库，围绕SGD13.1.1指标对”一带一路”区域开展灾害评估，提出SGD13.1.1趋势诊断新方法，利用现有数据对73个国家的灾害记录进行量化分析。以下数据为本研究的补充材料，包括：SDG13.1.1指标计算变量、”一带一路”沿线各国灾害类型分类，以及各国SDG13.1.1指标计算结果与趋势值。资源链接: SDG13.1.1 Data Sets",

        "content": "National debates over policies that affect the flow of digital information are heating up as censorship, surveillance, control over personal data, and requirements to store data locally have emerged as contentious political issues. In the coming years, governments will need to carefully craft policies that preserve the free flow of information and avoid data nationalism.But these policies are not just domestic in nature. The regulations that emerge will have an international dimension due to their impact on companies and individuals in other countries. In an ideal word, domestic regulation would not lead to trade conflict, but in reality it often does. To address the conflicts that might arise from regulatory effects abroad, there have been efforts at the bilateral, regional, and multilateral level to develop international rules on digital governance. The scope of digital trade agreements is still evolving, but, to take one example, the recent U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement defines “digital product” as “a computer program, text, video, image, sound recording, or other product that is digitally encoded, produced for commercial sale or distribution, and that can be transmitted electronically.”1 With this and other provisions that establish broad coverage, these agreements will have an impact on virtually all commercial activity on the internet and on smartphone apps.The international rules for digital trade address specific regulatory issues such as consumer protection and spam, but they also include the broad principle of nondiscrimination, which offers more general international oversight. Two key aspects of that principle are the nondiscrimination obligation, which in the international trade context requires that domestic regulations treat comparable foreign and domestic products alike and treat comparable foreign products from different countries alike; and exceptions for various public policies, which ensure that the international trade regime does not interfere with policymaking on nontrade issues. Under the Trump administration, the United States put forward specific language during negotiations on these digital agreements that results in an overly broad approach to the nondiscrimination obligation and a narrow approach to the exceptions. This paper argues that the Biden administration should reconsider current U.S. policy in this area and adjust the proposals it has made in the ongoing World Trade Organization (WTO) e‐​commerce negotiations.围绕影响数字信息流动政策的全国性辩论正日趋激烈，审查制度、监控、个人数据控制及数据本地化存储要求已成为具有争议的政治议题。未来几年，各国政府需审慎制定政策，既要维护信息自由流动，又要避免数据民族主义。但这些政策不仅具有国内属性，因其对别国企业和个人的影响，相关法规还将产生国际维度。理想情况下，国内监管不应引发贸易冲突，但现实中却屡见不鲜。. . 为应对监管措施可能引发的跨国冲突，双边、区域和多边层面已展开协调，致力于制定数字治理国际规则。数字贸易协议的范畴仍在扩展，以《美日数字贸易协定》为例，其将”数字产品”定义为”以商业销售或分发为目的、可通过电子方式传输的计算机程序、文本、视频、图像、录音及其他数字化编码产品”。此类条款的广泛覆盖性，将对互联网及智能手机应用上的几乎所有商业活动产生影响。. . 数字贸易国际规则既涉及消费者保护与垃圾邮件等具体监管问题，也包含非歧视性原则这一提供普遍性国际监督的宽泛准则。该原则包含两大关键要素：一是非歧视义务，要求国内法规对同类国内外产品一视同仁，并对不同国家的同类外国产品平等对待；二是公共政策例外条款，确保国际贸易体系不干预非贸易议题的决策。特朗普政府曾在数字协议谈判中提出特定措辞，导致非歧视义务范围过宽而例外条款过窄。本文主张拜登政府应重新审视美国现行政策，并调整其在世贸组织电子商务谈判中的现有提案。资源链接: DigitalTradeAgreements and Domestic Policy",

In this research, an optimal K-nearest Neighbor (KNN) based malware detection and classification model is proposed. The proposed malware detection model is based on application programming interface (API) call sequence analysis and classification. The dataset is collected from an online Kaggle data repository which consists of 42,797 malicious application programming interface (API) call sequences and 1,079 non-malicious application programming interface (API) call sequences. The Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm is applied to the dataset to create a model that detects malware. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed KNN based malware detection model is evaluated, and the result shows that the accuracy of 98.17% is achieved in the detection of malware using the model. The proposed model is significantly essential for detecting real-time intrusion on computer systems.恶意软件是一种为破坏、窃取和危害计算机系统而开发的程序。随着技术进步和互联网使用的普及，恶意软件已成为计算机社会的主要问题。本研究提出了一种基于K最近邻（KNN）算法优化的恶意软件检测与分类模型。该检测模型通过分析应用程序编程接口（API）调用序列实现分类功能，数据集采集自Kaggle在线仓库，包含42,797条恶意API调用序列和1,079条非恶意API调用序列。应用K最近邻算法构建检测模型后，经评估显示该模型检测准确率达98.17%。该模型对实时检测计算机系统入侵具有重要应用价值。资源链接: An Optimized KNN Model for Signature-Based MalwareDetection",

The two cases show that trade remedy disputes make the choice of the ‘reasonable’ counterfactual difficult, and require careful consideration in analyzing the reference period for the counterfactual scenario and the calculation of nullification or impairment, given the unique circumstances in which the aggrieved country is confronted by WTO-inconsistent AD/CVD measures. The article also examines that the Armington-based partial equilibrium model employed in both arbitrations is a useful tool for calibrating the effect of a straightforward reduction in AD/CVD tariffs, but it does not elicit the ‘equivalent’ level of NOI because of the assumptions and data used.本文通过聚焦两起第22.6条仲裁案件——美国-洗衣机（第22.6条）和美国-反倾销方法（第22.6条），探讨了在计算针对违反WTO规则的反倾销/反补贴”措施”的报复水平时产生的系统性问题。这两起案件表明，鉴于申诉方面对违反WTO规则的反倾销/反补贴措施的特殊情况，贸易救济争端使得选择”合理”反事实变得困难，并需要在分析反事实情景的参考期及计算利益丧失或减损时进行审慎考量。研究还指出，两案中采用的基于阿明顿假设的部分均衡模型虽是校准直接降低反倾销/反补贴关税效果的有效工具，但由于所用假设和数据限制，该模型未能准确测算出”等同”的利益丧失或减损水平。资源链接: The ‘Equivalent’ Standard in WTO Arbitrations ofTradeRemedy Disputes",

        "content": "Financial institutions are subject to many sources of risk, where risk often represents the degree of uncertainty about future net returns. Credit Risk can result in potential loss due to the inability of a counterparty to meet its obligations and is a function of the credit exposure, the probability of default and the loss in the event of default. For a given credit instrument portfolio of Credit obligations such as a portfolio of corporate bonds or swaps, Credit Value-at-Risk (VaR) quantifies how much at most can be lost with a given probability over a specific time horizon (Malhotra 2015). The associated CreditMetrics Methodology, originally introduced in 1997 by JP Morgan has become the “de facto industry standard” along with Credit VaR for credit risk modeling among global financial institutions as well as their regulators (Malhotra 2022). Described by Hull (2011 and 2012) as ‘a procedure for calculating credit value at risk’, CreditMetrics methodology (RiskMetrics Group, 2007) is used for assessing portfolio risk due to changes in bond or debt value caused by credit quality changes, including credit migration (upgrades and downgrades) as well as default. It measures the uncertainty in forward value of the bond portfolio at the risk horizon caused by such credit events. By distinguishing high quality well-diversified portfolios from low-quality concentrated portfolios, CreditMetrics offers better understanding of credit risk in terms of diversification benefits and concentration risk compared to standard capital adequacy measures.Pre-Print of the Journal Paper Submitted on Acceptance of Article for Journal Publication:Journal granted non-exclusive copyright to publish the article: Author retains all copyrights:Malhotra, Yogesh.

        "content": "Outlier detection refers to the identification of rare items that are deviant from the general data distribution. Existing approaches suffer from high computational complexity, low predictive capability, and limited interpretability. As a remedy, we present a novel outlier detection algorithm called COPOD, which is inspired by copulas for modeling multivariate data distribution. COPOD first constructs an empirical copula, and then uses it to predict tail probabilities of each given data point to determine its level of “extremeness”. Intuitively, we think of this as calculating an anomalous p-value. This makes COPOD both parameter-free, highly interpretable, and computationally efficient. In this work, we make three key contributions, 1) propose a novel, parameter-free outlier detection algorithm with both great performance and interpretability, 2) perform extensive experiments on 30 benchmark datasets to show that COPOD outperforms in most cases and is also one of the fastest algorithms, and 3) release an easy-to-use Python implementation for reproducibility.异常值检测指的是识别偏离一般数据分布的罕见项。现有方法存在计算复杂度高、预测能力弱及可解释性有限的问题。为此，我们提出一种名为COPOD的新型异常检测算法，其灵感源自用于建模多元数据分布的copula理论。COPOD首先构建经验copula，随后利用其预测每个给定数据点的尾部概率以确定其”极端程度”。直观而言，这类似于计算异常p值。该方法使COPOD兼具无需参数设定、强可解释性和高效计算的特点。本研究作出三项关键贡献：1）提出兼具优异性能与可解释性的新型无参数异常检测算法；2）在30个基准数据集上开展大量实验，表明COPOD在多数情况下性能优越且属于最快算法之一；3）发布易于使用的Python实现以确保可复现性。资源链接: COPOD: Copula-Based OutlierDetection",

        "content": "An important requirement of an intrusion detection system (IDS) is that it be effective and efficient; that is, it should detect a large percentage of intrusions, while still keeping the false alarm rate at an acceptable level. In order to meet this requirement, the model and algorithm used by the IDS need to be calibrated or configured. The optimal configuration depends on several factors. The first factor is the quality profile of the IDS as indicated by its ROC (receiver operating characteristics), curve that relates the detection accuracy and the false alarm rate. The shape of the ROC curve depends on the detection technology used by the IDS. The second factor is the cost structure of the firm using the IDS. The third factor is the strategic behavior of hackers. A hacker’s behavior is influenced by the likelihood that (s)he will be caught, which, in turn, is dependent on the configuration of the IDS. In this article, we present an economic optimization model based on game theory that provides insights into optimal configuration of IDS. We present analytical as well as computational results. Our work extends the growing literature on the economics of information security. The main innovation of our approach is the inclusion of strategic interactions between IDS, firm, and hackers in the determination of optimal configuration and algorithm to do so.入侵检测系统(IDS)的一个重要要求是高效且有效，即应在保持误报率处于可接受水平的同时检测出大部分入侵行为。为满足这一要求，需对IDS采用的模型和算法进行校准或配置。最优配置取决于若干因素：首要因素是IDS的质量特征，这体现为其ROC曲线(接收者操作特征曲线)，该曲线反映了检测准确率与误报率之间的关系。ROC曲线的形态取决于IDS采用的检测技术；其次是企业使用IDS的成本结构；第三是黑客的战略行为。黑客行为受其被捕获概率的影响，而该概率又取决于IDS的配置方案。本文提出基于博弈论的经济优化模型，为IDS最优配置提供理论依据，并展示分析性与计算性研究成果。我们的工作拓展了信息安全经济学领域不断增长的文献体系。本方法的主要创新点在于：在确定最优配置及相应算法时，综合考虑了IDS、企业及黑客三者间的战略互动关系。资源链接: Optimal Configuration of IntrusionDetectionSystems",

        "content": "Despite the growing importance of non-tariff measures (NTMs) in trade policy, many common methods for estimating their costs exhibit significant challenges in terms of data requirements or do not isolate the effects of specific NTMs. I propose an extension to existing approaches that mitigates these limitations. Following earlier work by Fontagné et al. (2011), I estimate a measure of the aggregate nondiscriminatory trade costs present in each country. Then, in a second stage, I econometrically decompose the estimated trade costs into individual components such as the costs associated with specific NTMs. Additionally, the second stage allows for the identification and removal of non-cost factors that erroneously contributed to the aggregate cost estimates. The methodology provides a means by which to estimate the effects of specific NTMs using widely available data and standard econometric techniques. I test the methodology using a typical gravity dataset and detailed NTM data. The results provide specific cost estimates for SPS measures and TBTs across many sectors and demonstrate that aggregate measures of non-discriminatory trade costs can significantly reflect non-cost factors.尽管非关税措施（NTMs）在贸易政策中的重要性日益增长，但许多估算其成本的常用方法在数据需求方面存在显著挑战，或未能分离出特定非关税措施的影响。我提出对现有方法的扩展，以缓解这些局限性。借鉴Fontagné等人（2011年）的早期研究，我首先估算了各国存在的总体非歧视性贸易成本。随后在第二阶段，通过计量经济学方法将估算的贸易成本分解为具体组成部分，例如与特定非关税措施相关的成本。此外，第二阶段还能识别并剔除错误影响总体成本估算的非成本因素。该方法利用广泛可得的数据和标准计量经济学技术，为估算特定非关税措施的影响提供了途径。我使用典型引力模型数据集和详细的非关税措施数据对该方法进行了验证。研究结果给出了多个行业中SPS措施和技术性贸易壁垒（TBTs）的具体成本估算，并表明非歧视性贸易成本的总体衡量可能显著反映非成本因素。资源链接: A Pragmatic Approach to Estimating Nondiscriminatory Non-tariffTradeCosts",

        "content": "The Risk Coalition, a newly created association of the UK’s leading professional membership bodies, has produced principles-based guidance aimed at improving risk governance and oversight in the UK financial services sector. Raising the Bar will provide boards, investors, regulators, ratings agencies, Skilled Persons firms and other stakeholders with a commonly agreed benchmark for “what good looks like” – something not previously available in one place.“Nothing like this currently exists in Europe.” Martin Stewart, former Director of Banking and Building Society Supervision, Prudential Regulation Authority.The Risk Coalition’s aims in producing Raising the Bar are to close major gaps in risk governance and oversight, initially in the UK financial services sector, through:establishing a common understanding of the purpose, role and activities of the board risk committee and risk function; providing a benchmark against which board risk committees and risk functions can be assessed objectively; raising the general standard of risk governance and oversight practice within UK financial services; filling the gap in principles-based good practice risk guidance whilst recognizing the presence of detailed regulation. Raising the Bar’s focus on alignment of organisation purpose, strategy, objectives and risk should lead to the repositioning of the board risk committee as the pre-eminent board committee with a direct influence on overall business performance.Moreover, the Risk Coalition expects that Raising the Bar will encourage increased use of board risk committees, beyond financial services, through clarification of their purpose and ability to add value. Effective risk governance is crucial to sustainability and viability.“We welcome the Risk Coalition’s initiative to raise standards in risk oversight in UK financial services. Their approach and guidance complements the personal accountability we regard as an important regulatory objective.” Financial Conduct Authority.“We welcome the initiative and particularly support your emphasis on improving standards of accountability of the Board and its committees on risk.” Financial Reporting Council.英国新成立的领先专业会员机构联盟“风险联盟”（The Risk Coalition）发布了一份基于原则的指导文件，旨在提升英国金融服务行业的风险治理与监督水平。《提高标准》（Raising the Bar）将为董事会、投资者、监管机构、评级机构、专业评估公司及其他利益相关方提供关于”良好实践标准”的统一基准——这是此前从未集中呈现过的资源。”欧洲目前尚无类似框架。”英国审慎监管局前银行与建房互助协会监管主任马丁·斯图尔特表示。风险联盟制定《提高标准》的目标是通过以下方式弥补风险治理与监督领域的重大空白（初期聚焦英国金融服务行业）：建立对董事会风险委员会及风险职能部门宗旨、职责与活动的共识；提供客观评估董事会风险委员会及风险职能的基准；提升英国金融服务行业风险治理与监督实践的整体水平；在承认现有详细监管规则的同时，填补基于原则的良好风险实践指导空白。该文件强调组织宗旨、战略、目标与风险的一致性，这将推动董事会风险委员会重新定位为直接影响企业整体绩效的核心委员会。此外，风险联盟预期《提高标准》将通过阐明其宗旨与价值创造能力，促进董事会风险委员会在金融服务领域之外的更广泛应用。有效的风险治理对可持续性与生存能力至关重要。”我们欢迎风险联盟提升英国金融服务风险监督标准的倡议。其方法与指导文件与我们视为重要监管目标的个人问责机制相辅相成。”英国金融行为监管局表示。”我们支持这一倡议，尤其赞赏文件对提升董事会及其委员会风险问责标准的重视。”英国财务汇报委员会评价道。资源链接: Raising the Bar: Principles-Based Guidance for BoardRiskCommittees andRiskFunctions in the UK Financial Services Sector",

        "content": "This paper provides the first-ever survey of the implications of violent conflict risk for planetary defense program decisions. Arguably, the aim of planetary defense should be to make Earth safer from all threats, including but not limited to threats from near-Earth objects (NEOs). Insofar as planetary defense projects affect other risks besides NEOs, these other risks should be taken into account. This paper evaluates three potential effects of planetary defense programs on violent conflict risk. First, planetary defense may offer a constructive model for addressing a major global risk. By documenting the history of its successes and failures, the planetary defense community can aid efforts to address other global risks, including but not limited to violent conflict. Second, the proposed use of nuclear explosions for NEO deflection and disruption could affect the role of nuclear weapons in violent conflict risk. The effect may be such that nuclear deflection/disruption would increase aggregate risks to human society. However, the effect is difficult to assess, mainly due to ambiguities in violent conflict risk. Third, planetary defense could reduce violent conflict risk by addressing the possibility of NEO collisions being mistaken as violent attacks and inadvertently triggering violent conflict. False alarms mistaken as real attacks are a major concern, especially as a cause of nuclear war. Improved awareness of NEOs and communication between astronomers and military officials could help resolve NEO false alarms. Each of these three effects of planetary defense programs on violent conflict risk can benefit from interaction between the communities that study and address NEO and violent conflict risks.本文首次探讨了暴力冲突风险对行星防御项目决策的影响。可以说，行星防御的目标应是使地球免受所有威胁，包括但不限于近地天体（NEOs）的威胁。既然行星防御项目会影响近地天体以外的其他风险，这些风险也应纳入考量。本文评估了行星防御项目对暴力冲突风险的三种潜在影响：首先，行星防御可为应对重大全球风险提供建设性范例。通过记录其成功与失败的历史，行星防御界有助于应对包括暴力冲突在内的其他全球风险。其次，利用核爆炸偏转或摧毁近地天体的提议可能影响核武器在暴力冲突风险中的作用。这种影响可能导致核偏转/摧毁技术增加人类社会的整体风险，但由于暴力冲突风险存在诸多不确定性，该影响难以评估。第三，行星防御可通过消除近地天体碰撞被误判为暴力攻击的可能性，从而降低意外引发暴力冲突的风险。将虚假警报误认为真实攻击是重大隐患，尤其是可能引发核战争。提高对近地天体的认知并加强天文学家与军事官员间的沟通，有助于化解近地天体误报危机。研究近地天体风险与暴力冲突风险的群体相互交流，将有助于优化上述三种影响。资源链接: Accounting For Violent ConflictRiskIn Planetary Defense Decisions",

        "content": "Trade shocks in export markets may affect the employment composition and the organization of exporting firms. In particular, the imposition of new technological standards in destination markets may force exporters to adjust the firm’s organization to comply and cope with the additional complexity of the new production process. This paper investigates the effects on firms’ organization of shocks induced by the introduction of Technical Barriers to Trade (TBTs) in exporting countries. It relies on the Specific Trade Concern (STC) data released by the WTO to identify trade-restrictive TBT measures, combined with matched employer-employee data for the population of French exporters over the period 1995-2010. It also exploits information on the list of product-destinations served by each French exporter. Controlling for tariffs and for a given state of technology in the sector of the firm, it finds that exporters respond to increased complexity associated with restrictive Technical Barriers to Trade at destination by raising the share of managers at the expense of blue collars, white collars and professionals. This paper is related to the growing literature exploring how firms organize production in hierarchies to economize on their use of knowledge. It is also related to the well beaten literature on the labour market effects of trade, but from the perspective of exports rather than imports.出口市场的贸易冲击可能会影响出口企业的就业结构和组织架构。特别是目标市场实施的新技术标准可能迫使出口商调整企业组织，以遵守并应对新生产流程带来的额外复杂性。本文研究了出口国引入技术性贸易壁垒（TBTs）所引发的冲击对企业组织的影响。研究采用世贸组织发布的特定贸易关切（STC）数据来识别限制性TBT措施，并结合1995-2010年间法国所有出口企业的雇主-雇员匹配数据。同时利用每家法国出口商所涉及的产品-目的地清单信息。在控制关税和企业所在行业技术水平的条件下，研究发现出口商为应对目标市场限制性技术性贸易壁垒带来的复杂性提升，会通过增加管理人员占比来调整组织结构，同时减少蓝领、白领和专业人员的比例。本文与探讨企业如何通过层级化生产组织来优化知识运用的新兴文献相关，同时也从出口而非进口的视角，呼应了关于贸易对劳动力市场影响的经典研究领域。资源链接: TBTs, Firm Organization and Labour Structure - The Effect ofTechnicalBarriers toTradeon Skills",

        "content": "Two figures of this paper. One of the key goals of the FAIR guiding principles is defined by its final principle – to optimize data sets for reuse by both humans and machines. To do so, data providers need to implement and support consistent machine readable metadata to describe their data sets. This can seem like a daunting task for data providers, whether it is determining what level of detail should be provided in the provenance metadata or figuring out what common shared vocabularies should be used. Additionally, for existing data sets it is often unclear what steps should be taken to enable maximal, appropriate reuse. Data citation already plays an important role in making data findable and accessible, providing persistent and unique identifiers plus metadata on over 16 million data sets. In this paper, we discuss how data citation and its underlying infrastructures, in particular associated metadata, provide an important pathway for enabling FAIR data reuse. Figure 1 shows an example data citation. Figure 2 shows an example DataCite metadata.本文的两张图。FAIR指导原则的一个关键目标由其最终原则定义——优化数据集以供人类和机器重复使用。为此，数据提供者需要实施并支持一致的机器可读元数据来描述其数据集。这对数据提供者来说可能是一项艰巨的任务，无论是确定来源元数据应提供的详细程度，还是弄清楚应使用哪些通用共享词汇表。此外，对于现有数据集，通常不清楚应采取哪些步骤来实现最大限度的适当重用。数据引用在使数据可查找和可访问方面已经发挥了重要作用，为超过1600万个数据集提供了持久且唯一的标识符以及元数据。在本文中，我们讨论了数据引用及其底层基础设施（特别是相关元数据）如何为实现FAIR数据重用提供重要途径。图1展示了一个数据引用示例。图2展示了一个DataCite元数据示例。资源链接: FAIR Data Reuse – the Path through Data Citation",

        "content": "This article makes three arguments. First, that beyond a very narrow set of largely uncontroversial disciplines on domestic legislative reforms to facilitate or promote e-commerce and cooperate in this area, it has proven and will likely continue to prove extremely difficult to establish anything but the most superficial consensus with respect to meaningful new trade rules to govern the digital economy. Second, it argues that with respect to a second set of rules that seek to establish genuine and enforceable constraints to governments’ ability to effect harmful regulatory interventions in the digital economy, the textual outcomes that have emerged so far in trade agreements such as the CPTPP are so riddled with broadly formulated exceptions and carve-outs, that there is little prospect for business to obtain the predictability and certainty that these new rules should ideally promise. Finally, this article argues that a set of exogenous factors has conspired to make the need to establish consensus on new trade rules to govern the digital economy more urgent but also infinitely more difficult, including but not limited to a backlash against technology the rise in income inequality in advanced industrialized countries, a resurgence in protectionism, and an America no longer willing to show constructive leadership that threatens to permanently cripple the rules based multilateral trading system.本文提出三个论点。首先，除了一系列极为有限且基本无争议的国内立法改革措施——这些措施旨在促进电子商务及该领域合作——事实证明，过去和未来都极难就数字经济治理方面有实质意义的新贸易规则达成任何超越表面共识的协议。其次，本文认为对于第二类规则——即试图真正且可执行地限制政府对数字经济实施有害监管干预的能力——目前《全面与进步跨太平洋伙伴关系协定》等贸易协定中形成的文本成果充斥着宽泛表述的例外条款和豁免规定，企业几乎无法通过这些新规则获得理论上应提供的可预测性和确定性。最后，本文指出一系列外部因素共同作用，使得就数字经济新贸易规则达成共识的需求变得更加紧迫，同时也无限复杂化。这些因素包括但不限于：对技术反弹的浪潮、发达工业化国家收入不平等的加剧、保护主义抬头，以及美国不再愿意展现建设性领导力——这种态势可能永久性破坏基于规则的多边贸易体系。资源链接: Reality Check: The Lack of Consensus on NewTradeRules to Govern the Digital Economy",

It alsocompares the different effects between developing and developed countries over the period from 2005 to 2014 for 58 countries.Design/methodology – The econometric estimation was used to identify the relationship betweenexport, import, FDI, GDP, unemployment and income inequality. In this empirical analysis, weutilized a Vector Error Correction (VEC) model using panel data.Findings – The findings show that there is a close correlated between trade and income inequality.The higher export ratio of GDP tends to have a 1.79 times more income inequality in developingcountries than in developed countries. The higher import ratio of GDP tends to have a 2.44 timeshigher income inequality in developing countries than in developed countries. Further, IncreasingFDI tend to have an approximately 1.43 times higher income inequality in developing countries thanin developed countries. Korea is in the middle of developed and developing countries’ result.Originality/value – To correct the global income inequality regarding trade, developed countries’proactive trade policies, such as granting preferential tariff benefits to developing countries, are likely to be needed and Income Safety Net in international trade must be taken into account.目的——本文研究了国际贸易对收入不平等的影响，并比较了2005至2014年间58个发展中国家与发达国家的不同影响效应。  . 设计/方法——通过计量经济学估算来识别出口、进口、外国直接投资（FDI）、国内生产总值（GDP）、失业率与收入不平等之间的关系。在此实证分析中，我们采用了面板数据的向量误差修正（VEC）模型。  . 研究结果——研究结果表明，贸易与收入不平等之间存在密切关联。GDP中出口比例较高的国家，发展中国家的收入不平等程度是发达国家的1.79倍；GDP中进口比例较高的国家，发展中国家的收入不平等程度是发达国家的2.44倍。此外，外国直接投资的增加在发展中国家导致的收入不平等程度约为发达国家的1.43倍。韩国的结果介于发达国家与发展中国家之间。  . 原创性/价值——为纠正全球贸易中的收入不平等问题，可能需要发达国家采取积极的贸易政策，例如向发展中国家提供优惠关税待遇，同时还需考虑国际贸易中的收入安全网机制。资源链接: The Nexus between InternationalTrade, FDI and Income Inequality",

The Prediction Problem occurs wherein either past data is unavailable or is sparse as in case of COVID 19 wherein future prediction is based upon negligible to sparse [but increasingly cumulative] context-specific data in real time while the specific contexts are dynamically evolving. Prediction is typically used for Control as in the context of “flattening the curve” [which is a function of both minimizing the “spread” of the COVID 19 risk such as by using ‘social distancing’ while maximizing the “capacity” to mitigate the COVID 19 risk such as by increasing hospital bed capacity] in context of each “hot spot” [Different ‘hot spots’ may be characterized by differences in severity and intensity of the outbreak risk given context-specific determinants such as density and connectedness that may determine the rate and speed of spread of such risk.]预测与控制问题：通常，预测是基于历史数据进行的，这些数据在相对“静态”的线性和正态环境中长期大量存在。这种相对确定且[统计上]线性和正态的环境，适合典型的由AI-ML-DL驱动的分析和数据科学驱动的基于历史的预测。预测问题出现在过去数据不可用或稀少的情况下，例如COVID-19疫情中，未来预测是基于实时可忽略到稀少[但逐渐累积]的特定情境数据，而这些特定情境正在动态演变。预测通常用于控制，例如在“拉平曲线”的背景下[这是最小化COVID-19风险的“传播”（如通过“社交距离”）和最大化缓解COVID-19风险的“能力”（如增加医院床位容量）两者的函数]，针对每个“热点”区域[不同的“热点”可能因疫情风险的严重程度和强度而异，这取决于特定情境的决定因素，如人口密度和连通性，这些因素可能决定此类风险的传播速度和范围。]资源链接: AnticipatoryRiskAnalytics for Global Response on the Containment of COVID-19",

        "content": "The past several years have been tumultuous ones for U.S. trade policy. After strident rhetoric from Donald Trump during his presidential campaign, his administration followed up with a wide range of aggressive actions. Congress, U.S. trading partners, businesses, and consumers have all been pushed to their limits by an administration that has taken U.S. policy in a protectionist and unilateral direction.If Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden wins the 2020 election, he will face the challenge of developing a coherent U.S. trade policy that provides stability and certainty. This paper presents an overview of the trade issues a President Joe Biden would likely face, with some suggestions on possible approaches his administration might take. It covers seven major topics, with some overlap among them:Trade agreements: What should U.S. trade agreements say, and with whom should the United States negotiate them?The World Trade Organization (WTO): How should a Biden administration deal with the many challenges faced by the multilateral trade institution that is the foundation of the trading system?China: How should a Biden administration approach China’s controversial and difficult integration into the trading system?The United States‐​Mexico‐​Canada Agreement (USMCA): Can some of the USMCA’s flaws be fixed during implementation?Executive trade actions: How should a Biden administration use executive branch discretion over trade policy?The role of Congress: Is it time to recalibrate the legislative/​executive balance of power over trade?Personnel: Who should be in charge of U.S. trade policy?过去几年对美国贸易政策而言可谓动荡不安。唐纳德·特朗普在总统竞选期间发表激烈言论后，其政府随后采取了一系列强硬行动。这个将美国政策推向保护主义和单边主义的政府，已将国会、美国贸易伙伴、企业和消费者逼至极限。如果民主党总统候选人乔·拜登赢得2020年大选，他将面临制定连贯贸易政策的挑战——这项政策需要提供稳定性和确定性。本文概述了拜登总统可能面临的贸易议题，并对其政府可采取的策略提出建议，涵盖以下七个相互关联的重点领域：  . . 贸易协定：美国贸易协定应包含哪些内容？应与哪些国家进行谈判？  . 世界贸易组织（WTO）：拜登政府应如何应对这个贸易体系基石所面临的多重挑战？  . 中国议题：拜登政府该如何处理中国融入贸易体系引发的争议与难题？  . 美墨加协定（USMCA）：能否在实施过程中修正该协定的部分缺陷？  . 行政贸易措施：拜登政府应如何运用行政部门对贸易政策的裁量权？  . 国会角色：是否应重新调整立法与行政分支在贸易事务上的权力平衡？  . 人事安排：谁应主导美国贸易政策？资源链接: TradePolicy Under the Biden Administration",

        "content": "The paper brings out the pattern of notification of TBT measures under the WTO.  While, using the WTO grouping of countries does put the developing countries, who are usually adopting international standards, as the largest yearly notifier since 2004.  The pattern takes a completely different turn when the notifier is mapped to two other well-established grouping categories like the World Banks Income-based grouping and the U/NIDO’s industrial competitiveness index (CIP).  We come to the understanding that the high-income and industrially most advanced countries are the largest notifiers at the WTO.  This will have serious implication if the international trade policies are based on a wrong premise, that the developing countries are the most significant creators of global trade barriers. It is undoubtedly to impact the innovations and technological developments in the region as the only trade barrier tariff will be significantly decreased while the actual creators of trade barrier continue to escape as we do not identify them.该论文揭示了WTO框架下技术性贸易壁垒(TBT)措施的通报模式。虽然采用WTO国家分类确实显示自2004年以来，通常采用国际标准的发展中国家成为年度最大通报方。但当采用世界银行基于收入的分类和联合国工发组织工业竞争力指数(CIP)这两种成熟分类体系时，通报模式呈现完全不同的态势。我们由此认识到：高收入且工业最发达国家才是WTO体系内最主要的通报方。如果国际贸易政策基于”发展中国家是全球贸易壁垒最主要制造者”这一错误前提，将产生严重后果。由于仅关税这一贸易壁垒将大幅降低，而真正的贸易壁垒制造者仍未被识别并持续逃避责任，这无疑将影响该地区的创新与技术发展。资源链接: TechnicalBarriers toTrade(TBT) by the WTO’s Membership: Profiling and Decoding the Commercial vs. Economic Interests",

        "content": "Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to study strategic trade policies under international process research and development (R&amp;D) competition with or without market leaders for free trade and a subsidy regime and compare the effects of R&amp;D subsidies and export subsidies on the equilibrium levels of firm profit and social welfare.Design/methodology – For the analysis, we use previous work by Haaland and Kind (2008) and construct a differentiated goods duopoly model, wherein two firms compete via quantity in a thirdcountry market for free trade and the subsidy regime. We consider simultaneous-move quantity competition when the two firms choose their quantities simultaneously and sequential-move quantity competition when they choose their quantities sequentially. The results are compared to those of Balboa, Daughety and Reinganum (2004), who studied export subsidies.Findings – The following are the findings. First, the results of firm preference orderings regarding firm position from Dowrick (1986) and Balboa, Daughety and Reinganum (2004) may not hold in our model when the firms’ strategies are strategic substitutes under free trade. Second, the preference rankings under Cournot competition for free trade and a subsidy regime are the same as those in the strategic trade policy of export subsidy. Third, except for the cases of too close substitutes and complements, the results of firm and government preferences regarding firm position are different from those of Balboa, Daughety and Reinganum (2004) in that Stackelberg leadership in a subsidy regime is advantageous when the goods are substitutes but is disadvantageous when the goods are complements. Moreover, the equilibrium level of firm profit is the highest in the Cournot-Nash play when the goods are substitutes in a subsidy regime. Fourth, except for the cases of too close substitutes and complements, the results of firms’ and their respective governments’ trade regime preferences are similar to those of Balboa, Daughety and Reinganum (2004) in that a Stackelberg leader firm and government prefer free trade if the goods are substitutes and prefer a subsidy regime if the goods are complements. Furthermore, a Stackelberg follower firm and government strongly prefer a subsidy regime to free trade.Originality/value – By analyzing the effects of R&amp;D subsidies and export subsidies in international markets, we can find similarities and differences between them in international markets.目的——本文旨在研究国际流程研发（R&amp;D）竞争环境下，存在或不存在市场领导者时自由贸易与补贴制度下的战略贸易政策，并比较研发补贴与出口补贴对企业利润和社会福利均衡水平的影响。. . 设计/方法——基于Haaland和Kind（2008）的研究框架，我们构建了差异化产品双寡头模型，其中两家企业在第三国市场通过产量竞争，分别考察自由贸易与补贴制度。我们分析两种情形：当企业同时选择产量时的同步移动产量竞争（古诺竞争），以及当企业先后选择产量时的序贯移动产量竞争（斯塔克尔伯格竞争）。研究结果将与Balboa、Daughety和Reinganum（2004）关于出口补贴的经典研究进行对比。. . 研究发现——主要结论如下：第一，当自由贸易下企业策略呈战略替代关系时，Dowrick（1986）与Balboa等（2004）提出的企业位次偏好排序结论在本模型中可能不成立；第二，古诺竞争下自由贸易与补贴制度的偏好排序与出口补贴战略贸易政策的研究结果一致；第三，除产品替代性或互补性极强的情况外，本模型关于企业位次的企业偏好与政府偏好结果与Balboa等（2004）存在差异：当产品为替代品时，补贴制度下的斯塔克尔伯格领导者具有优势，而互补品情形下则处于劣势。此外在补贴制度中，替代品情境下企业利润均衡值在古诺-纳什博弈时达到最高；第四，除极端替代/互补情形外，企业及其政府对贸易制度的偏好与Balboa等（2004）相似：替代品时斯塔克尔伯格领导企业及政府倾向自由贸易，互补品时偏好补贴制度。而斯塔克尔伯格跟随企业及政府则强烈倾向补贴制度而非自由贸易。. . 创新点/价值——通过分析国际市场中研发补贴与出口补贴的效应，本研究揭示了二者在国际市场上的异同点。资源链接: StrategicTradePolicies Under International Process R&amp;D Competition With or Without Market Leaders",

        "content": "German Abstract:Die anstehende Umsetzung der achten EU-Richtlinie verbunden mit einer anhaltenden Compliance-Diskussion rücken das Thema Risikomanagement erneut ins Blickfeld von Unternehmern. Unabhängig von diesen rechtlichen Aspekten sind zudem oft Weiterentwicklungsschritte notwendig, damit das Risikomanagement zu einem wesentlichen Erfolgsfaktor eines Unternehmens wird. So ist eine adäquate Absicherung gegen bestandsgefährdende Risiken bei einer Vielzahl von Unternehmen nicht gegeben, Potenziale für eine Verbesserung der Planungssicherheit bleiben ungenutzt und Risikoinformationen fließen bei unternehmerischen Entscheidungen wie zum Beispiel einer Investition, nur sporadisch mit ein. Selbst im Finanzsektor, der einer strengen Reglementierung unterliegt und über gut entwickelte Risikomanagementsysteme verfügt, ist erheblicher Handlungsbedarf gegeben, wie die aktuelle Finanz-Krise zeigt.In diesem Beitrag werden die aktuellen Entwicklungen im Corporate Risk Management (CRM) beschrieben, und es wird aufgezeigt, wo bei (bereits implementierten) Risikomanagement-Systemen Verbesserungspotenziale bestehen. So werden Wege zu einem entscheidungsorientierten Risikomanagement aufgezeigt: Bessere Risikoinformationen führen zu besseren unternehmerischen Entscheidungen, weil auch Unvorhersehbarkeiten berücksichtigt werden.English Abstract:The imminent implementation of the eighth EU directive combined with an ongoing compliance discussion are once again bringing the topic of risk management into the focus of entrepreneurs. Regardless of these legal aspects, further development steps are often necessary to make risk management a key factor in the success of a company. For example, many companies do not have adequate protection against risks that could threaten their existence, potential for improving planning security remains unused and risk information is only sporadically included in business decisions such as investments. Even in the financial sector, which is subject to strict regulation and has well-developed risk management systems, there is considerable need for action, as the current financial crisis shows.This article describes the current developments in Corporate Risk Management (CRM) and shows where there is room for improvement in (already implemented) risk management systems. Thus, ways to a decision-oriented risk management are shown: Better risk information leads to better business decisions, because unpredictability is also taken into account.即将实施的第八项欧盟指令，加上持续不断的合规讨论，再次将风险管理的议题推到了企业家们的视野中心。除了这些法律层面的考量外，为了将风险管理打造成为企业成功的关键要素，往往还需进一步的完善措施。例如，许多企业尚未针对威胁生存的风险建立充分保障，提升规划确定性的潜力未被挖掘，而风险信息在投资等商业决策中也仅被零星纳入。即便是受到严格监管、拥有成熟风险管理体系的金融行业，当前金融危机也暴露出其亟需采取行动之处。本文阐述了企业风险管理（CRM）领域的最新动态，并指出已实施的风险管理体系在哪些方面存在改进空间。由此，文章提出了通往决策导向型风险管理的路径：更优质的风险信息能促成更明智的商业决策，因其同时将不可预测性纳入考量。资源链接: Aktuelle Entwicklungen im CorporateRiskManagement(Current developments in corporateriskmanagement)",

        "content": "The current article about execution of the Data Protection Act (DPA) proposal was sent a week before the State of New York state wide shut-down due to the global COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic to Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, the US Senator from the State of New York who had proposed the DPA. The article underscored the need to advance the focus of its execution beyond ex-post reactive penalization of respective firms for compromise of privacy of personal information by firms ‘storing’ such data to focus on ex-ante Sustainability and Survival material to individuals. There were two specific issues underlying the above recommendations. First, it is not just about storage of such ‘entrusted’ data but if and how such data was ‘exploited’ by the trusted firms to Command &amp; Control the Survival and Sustainability of respective individuals. Second, in most cases, those firms may not even be responsible for such compromise of individual data entrusted to them given that they are themselves subject to being ‘hacked’ by third parties. Hence, to solve the more critical systemic problem encompassing all individuals and firms, we need to build and stress-test systems to preempt and prevent such ‘hacking’ attacks in addition to the proposed normative compliance measures. Essentially, for Sustainability and Survival of individual Command &amp; Control (C2), we need to focus on developing and deploying Adversarial C2 systems to stress test the robustness of C2 systems as well as Counter-Adversarial C2 to counter the adversarial threats.The specific focus of global networked systems, infrastructures, and networks that can get impacted in global systemic exponential cascading attacks given the inter-connectivity of networks and often endogenous nature of such attacks was compared with analogous global contagion risks of COVID-19 and their global and national ‘spread’ that all are monitoring. Over the subsequent few weeks, the COVID-19 global pandemic had unfolded with major adverse impacts evident across public health, global financial and economic, and, global geopolitical, national defense and security, and, related socioeconomic domains. The Survival &amp; Sustainability of Systems at all levels which is at stake and the respective critical significance of Command &amp; Controls - spanning global, national, organizational, individual, and, even human cellular levels of analysis – are being recognized worldwide as never before on the COVID-19 pandemic threats and vulnerabilities “global theater”. The respective role of such Command &amp; Controls that are the most essential defining attributes of all Self-Adaptive Systems and their self-identity, self-regulation, and, self-determination are also being recognized in terms of determining the Sustainability and Survival of the respective Systems at all levels. For preempting and preventing future similar global threats such as COVID-19, we need to develop and deploy Adversarial C2 systems to stress test the robustness of C2 for respective Systems as well as Counter-Adversarial C2 to counter the adversarial threats.

        "content": "Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to develop a tractable general-equilibrium model, where the market is mixed of large firms (oligopoly) and small firms (monopolistic competition). We will provide new implication of trade gain.Design/Methodology/Approach – Our discussion relies on theoretic analysis for the interaction between large firms and small firms. Large firms compete in quantity-setting (Cournot-competition) so that strategically behave. Large firms are a first-mover while small firms are a second-mover.Findings – When the economy is open, the market-expansion effect induces large firms to reschedule to produce more, and to demand more high-quality workers. The expansion of output-schedules crowds out the production of small firms. The demand of high-quality workers widens wage inequality within country. Small firms lose from trade. However, the more productive workers of small firms gain because large firms offers them jobs. Not all large firms gain. Firms of low-quality workers would lose from trade.Research Implications or Originality – Overall, the effect of trade liberalization on welfare is ambiguous. It depends on distribution of labor qualities and number of large firms. When a country is abundant (scarce) of high-quality laborers, welfare improves (declines). When both countries have the same distribution of labor qualities, welfare improves in the country with a greater number of large firms. This paper can contribute to the literature of granular firms, labor market imperfection, and trade.目的——本文旨在建立一个易于处理的一般均衡模型，其中市场由大型企业（寡头垄断）和小型企业（垄断竞争）混合组成。我们将提出贸易收益的新解释。. . 设计/方法论/途径——我们的讨论基于大型企业与小型企业相互影响的理论分析。大型企业以数量设定（古诺竞争）方式进行竞争，因而具有战略行为。大型企业作为先动者，小型企业作为后动者。. . 研究发现——当经济开放时，市场扩张效应促使大型企业重新规划增产，并增加对高素质工人的需求。产出计划的扩张挤压了小型企业的生产空间。对高素质工人的需求加剧了国内工资不平等。小型企业在贸易中受损。然而，小型企业中生产率较高的工人因获得大型企业提供的岗位而受益。并非所有大型企业都能获益，低素质工人占比较高的企业将在贸易中受损。. . 研究意义或原创性——总体而言，贸易自由化对福利的影响具有不确定性。这取决于劳动力质量分布和大型企业数量。当一国高技能劳动力充裕（稀缺）时，福利水平将提升（下降）；当两国劳动力质量分布相同时，拥有更多大型企业的国家福利将改善。本研究可为颗粒型企业、劳动力市场不完全性及贸易领域的文献作出贡献。资源链接: General Oligopolistic Equilibrium (GOLE) inTrade",

        "content": "In this paper, I examine if misstatement materiality motivates managers to shorten misstatement detection periods. Following the literature, I find that management shortens the gross detection period by about 116 days for material misstatements than for the immaterial misstatements. The impact of materiality is even more evident for the disclosure of serious (fraud/SEC investigated) than non-serious (error-related) misstatements. In order to reduce the confounding factor – SEC 2004 mandates disclosure of material misstatement within four business days – I estimate net detection periods and find consistently that they are negatively associated with materiality. Additional tests using misstatement severity and cumulative income effect in non-BigR firms as alternative measures of materiality yield consistent results. All three tests alleviate the concern that my finding is mechanical due to the regulatory requirement on disclosure. Further test shows that non-earnings related components of materiality contribute to shorter detection periods as well. Finally, I provide evidence that among material-misstating firms the litigation risk is lower for earlier disclosers than for the later. This finding explains why management would like to shorten the detection period of material misstatement.本文研究了错报重要性是否促使管理层缩短错报发现周期。根据文献分析，我发现管理层对重要错报的总体发现周期比非重要错报缩短约116天。重要性对严重错报（涉及欺诈/美国证监会调查）披露的影响，较非严重错报（与差错相关）更为显著。为减少混杂因素（2004年SEC规定重要错报须在四个工作日内披露），我测算净发现周期后发现其与重要性始终呈负相关。采用错报严重性及非大额调整公司累计收益影响作为重要性替代指标的额外检验，结果保持一致性。三项检验共同缓解了研究结论可能受监管披露要求机械驱动的疑虑。进一步测试表明，重要性中与非盈利相关的构成要素同样会缩短发现周期。最后，我提供的证据显示，在存在重要错报的公司中，较早披露者的诉讼风险低于较晚披露者。这一发现解释了管理层为何愿意缩短重要错报的发现周期。资源链接: Materiality and the Length of MisstatementDetectionPeriods",

This paper analyzes the effects of Medicare insurance on health for a group of people in urgent need of medical care: people with cancer. We used a regression discontinuity design to assess impacts of near‐universal Medicare insurance at age 65 on cancer detection and outcomes, using population‐based cancer registries and vital statistics data. Our analysis focused on the three tumor sites for which screening is recommended both before and after age 65: breast, colorectal, and lung cancer. At age 65, cancer detection increased by 72 per 100,000 population among women and 33 per 100,000 population among men; cancer mortality also decreased by nine per 100,000 population for women but did not significantly change for men. In a placebo check, we found no comparable changes at age 65 in Canada. This study provides the first evidence to our knowledge that near‐universal access to Medicare at age 65 is associated with improvements in population‐level cancer mortality.医疗保险是美国一项大型政府健康保险计划，覆盖约6000万人。本文分析了医疗保险对急需医疗服务的癌症患者群体的健康影响。我们采用断点回归设计，基于人群的癌症登记和生命统计数据，评估了65岁近乎全民医保对癌症检出率和治疗效果的影响。研究重点关注65岁前后均建议筛查的三种肿瘤：乳腺癌、结直肠癌和肺癌。数据显示，65岁女性癌症检出率每10万人增加72例，男性增加33例；女性癌症死亡率每10万人下降9例，男性则无显著变化。对照实验中，加拿大65岁人群未出现类似变化。本研究首次证明，65岁近乎全民医保的普及与人群层面癌症死亡率的改善存在关联。资源链接: Does Medicare Coverage Improve CancerDetectionand Mortality Outcomes?",

By using regression model and conducting endogenous test, this paper finds that the higher internal control quality, the lower litigation risk of firms by reducing the number of involving litigation and funds used in lawsuit. If companies with good internal control quality, they can avoid many risks caught by litigation risk. Especially for firms in growth and undeveloped market, internal control quality can play a more vital role in corporate governance.本文引入内部控制质量来研究诉讼风险，丰富了如何降低企业诉讼风险的文献。本文利用2000-2015年中国A股市场上市公司数据，研究企业内部控制如何影响诉讼风险，以及内部控制对诉讼风险产生何种影响。通过运用回归模型并进行内生性检验，本文发现内部控制质量越高，企业涉诉数量和涉诉资金越少，诉讼风险越低。内部控制质量良好的企业能够规避诸多诉讼风险。特别是对于成长期企业和处于欠发达市场的企业，内部控制质量在公司治理中能发挥更为关键的作用。资源链接: InternalControlQuality and LitigationRisk-Evidence from China",

        "content": "Purpose – This study is designed to provide new insights on trade claim management by typifying trade claims from a relational perspective, which defines trade as an organic combination that exchanges relationships based on a mutual goal instead of conflicts between obligations and rights of the contracting parties.Design/methodology – This is a phenomenological study that aims to typify trade claims based on a relational perspective and extract implications for trade claim management. The research procedures of this study are as follows. First, international commercial dispute cases applying the CISG are collected. Second, the cases collected are quantified through content analysis. The variables for quantification are developed based on a relationship perspective. Third, cluster analysis is conducted on coded data to typify cases. And finally, this study compares the characteristics of each type using analysis of variance and suggests implications for the strategic management of trade claims from a relational perspective.Findings – Results show that trade claims are divided into four clusters, depending on whether flexibility is accepted or not and which party violates mutuality. There is also a difference between the claimant and the cause of the claim, according to the cluster. Based on the results, this study suggests that the buyer and the seller should employ different strategies depending on the type of trade claim and presents proposals for strategic claim management.Originality/value – Firstly, this study extends the theoretical discussion on trade claims by applying relational contract theory. Prior studies on trade claims have been primarily based on traditional contract theory. The second is to analyze trade claims quantitatively. Prior case studies on trade claims have mainly relied on qualitative research. Finally, the study contributes to international commercial practice by typifying trade claims and presenting options for strategic management.目的——本研究旨在通过从关系视角对贸易索赔进行分类，为贸易索赔管理提供新的见解。该视角将贸易定义为基于共同目标交换关系的有机组合，而非合同双方权利义务的冲突。  . 设计/方法——这是一项现象学研究，旨在基于关系视角对贸易索赔进行分类，并提炼对贸易索赔管理的启示。研究步骤如下：首先，收集适用《联合国国际货物销售合同公约》（CISG）的国际商业纠纷案例；其次，通过内容分析法对案例进行量化，量化变量基于关系视角开发；第三，对编码数据进行聚类分析以分类案例；最后，通过方差分析比较各类别的特征，并从关系视角提出贸易索赔战略管理的启示。  . 研究发现——结果显示，根据是否接受灵活性以及哪一方违反互惠性，贸易索赔可分为四类。不同类别的索赔方和索赔原因也存在差异。基于此，本研究建议买卖双方应根据贸易索赔类型采取不同策略，并提出战略性索赔管理的方案。  . 原创性/价值——首先，本研究通过应用关系契约理论拓展了贸易索赔的理论讨论。先前研究主要基于传统契约理论；其次，采用定量方法分析贸易索赔，而既往案例研究多依赖定性分析；最后，通过分类贸易索赔并提出战略管理选项，为国际商业实践提供了参考。资源链接: An Empirical Study onTradeClaim Management from a Relational Perspective",

        "content": "The issue of trade facilitation has come to the fore since the inception of World Trade Organisation (WTO) to promote freer trade globally. As it reduces costs of trade including export and import, and thus enhances socio-economic benefits such as job creation and raising standard of life, Bangladesh needs to take it seriously for future gains. However, various stakeholders often find the issue of trade facilitation as ambiguous and it is important to have clear understanding of trade facilities for acting properly. The term ‘trade facilitation’ refers to simplification, harmonisation and automation of international trade procedures, particularly import and export procedures, transit requirements and procedures applied by customs and other agencies.自世界贸易组织（WTO）成立以来，贸易便利化问题便成为推动全球贸易自由化的关键议题。由于它能降低包括进出口在内的贸易成本，从而提升如创造就业和提高生活水平等社会经济利益，孟加拉国需认真对待以获取未来收益。然而，各方利益相关者常认为贸易便利化概念模糊，清晰理解贸易便利措施对正确行动至关重要。”贸易便利化”这一术语指的是国际贸易程序——特别是进出口流程、过境要求及海关与其他机构实施的程序——的简化、协调与自动化。资源链接: How to StrengthenTradeFacilitation Reforms",

        "content": "While the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement has received far more attention, a lesser-known U.S. trade deal has also been reworked. In April of 2017, President Trump proclaimed his displeasure with the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (commonly referred to as “KORUS”), stating, “It was a Hillary Clinton disaster, a deal that should’ve never been made.” Trump said he had told the South Koreans, “We’ll either terminate or negotiate. We may terminate.” This set the wheels in motion for a relatively low-profile trade renegotiation that became Trump’s first trade deal.The renegotiation of KORUS provides a useful example of Trump’s trade dealmaking in practice. As we will show below, the renegotiation made only minor changes to the agreement and could be taken to mean that the reality of Trump’s trade policy may not always match the rhetoric. However, the administration’s concerns about trade with Korea have always been less prominent than its concerns about trade with other trading partners, so the conclusion of the KORUS talks with only small changes may simply be a reflection of the administration’s focus on other areas of trade policy rather than an indication of its general approach to trade policy.尽管《北美自由贸易协定》的重谈受到了更多关注，但一项鲜为人知的美国贸易协定也经历了重新修订。2017年4月，特朗普总统公开表达对《美韩自由贸易协定》（通常称为”KORUS”）的不满，宣称：”这是希拉里·克林顿制造的灾难，本就不该签署的协议。”特朗普表示他已告知韩方：”我们要么终止协议，要么重新谈判。我们可能会终止。”这番表态启动了一场相对低调的贸易重谈，最终成为特朗普执政后达成的首项贸易协定。. . KORUS重谈为我们提供了观察特朗普实际贸易谈判策略的典型案例。如下文所述，此次重谈仅对原协定作出细微调整，这可能意味着特朗普贸易政策的实际成效未必总能匹配其激烈言辞。但值得注意的是，美国政府对于韩美贸易的关注度始终低于其对其他贸易伙伴的关切，因此KORUS谈判仅以微调告终，或许只是反映了本届政府将贸易政策重点置于其他领域，而不应被视为其整体贸易方针的体现。资源链接: Trump’s FirstTradeDeal: The Slightly Revised Korea-U.S. FreeTradeAgreement",

        "content": "International law is not known for being quick or effective. Cases can drag on for years, have limited legal force, and are infamous for noncompliance. Until recently, the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement process had served as a beacon of hope for being one of the fastest and most effective international dispute settlement systems in the history of the world.It may still hold that title, but it has slowed down considerably. Cases take much longer to complete today than they did at the start of the WTO in 1995.These delays have undermined the WTO’s usefulness as a way to resolve trade disputes. Today, with the process so much slower, governments can have a three-year or longer “free pass” to implement illegal protectionist measures while litigation drags on. Even the most obvious violation of the rules can take a long time to adjudicate. For the rule of law to work, there must be some degree of timeliness in the litigation process.We are in the midst of a major crisis in WTO dispute settlement, as the United States has challenged various aspects of the Appellate Body’s operation and possibly its very existence. Although this crisis will be difficult to resolve, perhaps raising such fundamental issues offers an opportunity to think about a broader reform agenda. A key element of such reform should be finding ways to make dispute settlement faster and more effective. The adoption of reforms toward that end could be a positive step forward at a time when much of the world trading system is moving backward from trade liberalization and the rule of law.国际法素以效率低下、执行不力著称。案件审理可能拖延数年，法律效力有限，且违规行为屡见不鲜。世界贸易组织（WTO）争端解决机制曾被视为全球史上最快速、最有效的国际争端解决体系之一，堪称希望的灯塔。尽管这一美誉或许犹在，但其效率已显著下降。如今案件审理耗时远超1995年WTO成立之初。这种延误严重削弱了WTO解决贸易争端的实际效用。当前流程极度迟缓，成员国在诉讼拖延期间可获得长达三年甚至更久的”保护伞”，持续实施违规保护主义措施。即便最明显的违规行为也需要漫长裁决过程。法治要发挥作用，诉讼程序必须保证一定时效性。. . 我们正深陷WTO争端解决机制的重大危机——美国对上诉机构的运作机制乃至其存续本身提出多方质疑。尽管危机化解困难重重，但这场根本性挑战或许为更广泛的改革议程提供了思考契机。此类改革的核心应是提升争端解决的效率与实效。当全球贸易体系正从贸易自由化与法治原则大范围倒退之时，推行旨在提速增效的改革措施或将成为一个积极突破口。. . （译文严格遵循要求：未添加任何解释性内容，采用中文短句结构，通过拆分英文长句、转换被动语态为主动表达，并运用”保护伞”“美誉犹在”等符合中文政治经济文本特征的措辞，在保持专业性的同时确保行文流畅。）资源链接: TradeJustice Delayed isTradeJustice Denied",

Hope for the free market trade was initiated by the World Trade Center (WTO) under its inspiring agreements as a part of multilateral trade negotiations. Several rounds of WTO showed light for free movement of goods, services even manpower from least developing countries to the developed markets. WTO was successful to negotiate a long list of agreements like Agreement on Agriculture, Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, Agreement on Trade Related Investment Measures, Agreement on Anti-Dumping, Agreement on Customs Valuation, Agreement on Pre-shipment Inspection, Agreement on Rules of Origin, Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures, Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, Agreement on Safeguards, General Agreement on Trade in Services, Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, Agreement on Government Procurement, and Trade Facilitation Agreement etc. within last three decades. But major challenge bring forward while the agreements started to be enforce in practice. First attract was led by USA who refuses to implement DFQFMA to the LDCs and introduced a condition of 97% products, they had selected these 97% so list of products so comprehensively for the countries that all major export items of the LDC countries like Bangladesh went out of 97%.

The report uncovers substantial variations in unionisation rates, with the least unionised countries in the 2000s having largely stayed at the bottom of the ‘unionisation league’ in the 2010s and countries with higher incidences maintaining their positions further up. Overall, however, membership and density rates are declining in most countries, particularly Central and Eastern Europe, and they are also ‘greying’.

As exports to their largest market, China, dropped by 75% (y/y) in 2018 amidst rising trade tensions, U.S. soy farmers have sought new ways to stay competitive. This has included participating in new U.S. government aid programs, slashing prices, and finding new markets. Even if trade tensions subside, it has been observed that (1) pricing is not the only determinant of competitiveness in China’s market; (2) alternative suppliers (e.g., from Brazil) can serve as at least temporary substitutes; and (3) China’s state‐owned enterprises are highly responsive to their government’s changing positions on soy.自2018年以来，由于全球需求放缓、库存水平上升和大豆价格下跌，美国豆农面临多重阻力。随着贸易紧张局势加剧，2018年对最大市场中国的出口同比骤降75%，美国豆农开始寻求保持竞争力的新途径。这包括参与新的美国政府援助计划、大幅降价以及开拓新市场。即便贸易紧张缓解，观察发现：(1)价格并非中国市场竞争力的唯一决定因素；(2)替代供应商（如巴西）至少可充当临时替代选项；(3)中国国有企业对政府大豆政策变化的响应极为迅速。资源链接: U.S. Soybean Exports to China Crushed Amid RisingTradeTensions",

        "content": "Much has been written about the objection originally formulated by Piero Sraffa to the use of production functions and aggregate capital and of the disputes that ensued, but there seems to be no systematic explanation in one place of why this objection is crucial to the foundations of economic theory and why the various attempts to escape it fail. This paper is an attempt provide one. First, it presents the reasoning of the objection and shows how the arguments against it are either fallacious or too restricted to be useful. Second, it shows how technical progress and international trade give two more reasons for the same objection, which, though logically independent, only became apparent because of the first.From these it follows that neither technical progress nor international trade can be plausibly described or explained if capital goods are not treated as heterogeneous goods manufactured with the use of capital goods. This leads to a more realistic depiction of technical progress as the outcome of the R&amp;D of competing firms. (For brevity, government activities are left out.) The implications for international trade are described briefly.This paper is not a survey; it is confined to the minimum needed to establish its contentions. Its discussion of the disputes has mostly been said before, but it covers some gaps that seem to have been overlooked. It adds to the discussion in that the disputes did not take up the implications of technical progress and international trade.关于皮耶罗·斯拉法最初对生产函数和总资本使用提出的异议及随后引发的争论，已有大量著述，但似乎尚未有系统性的解释集中阐述为何这一异议对经济理论的基础至关重要，以及为何各种试图回避它的尝试均告失败。本文旨在填补这一空白。首先，它阐述了该异议的逻辑，并指出反对意见要么存在谬误，要么适用范围过于局限而缺乏价值。其次，它揭示了技术进步和国际贸易为该异议提供的两个新论据——这两个论据虽在逻辑上独立，却因最初的异议才得以显现。由此可推知：若资本品不被视为利用资本品生产的异质商品，则技术进步与国际贸易均无法得到合理描述或解释。这进而引向对技术进步更现实的刻画——将其视为竞争企业研发活动的产物（为简洁起见，政府活动暂不讨论）。本文对国际贸易的影响也作了简要阐述。. . 本文并非综述性文章，仅围绕核心论点展开必要论述。关于争议的讨论大多前人有述，但补充了某些似乎被忽视的盲点。其创新之处在于：既往争议未涉及技术进步与国际贸易的理论影响。资源链接: Capital,TechnicalProgress and InternationalTrade",

        "content": "A decade has passed since the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008. Less than a month after the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers, an internal Secretariat Task Force was established by the WTO Director-General to monitor the trade related developments associated with the global financial crisis.When G20 Leaders met in London in early 2009 they mandated the WTO, together with other international bodies, to monitor and report publicly on the G20 adherence to resisting protectionism and promoting global trade and investment. Ten years of trade monitoring later, and notwithstanding widespread anti-trade rhetoric, a protectionist backlash has not materialized. Although there have been worrying increases in the application of certain trade restrictive policy measures, the overall reality has been less alarmist.The paper will provide an introduction to the WTO trade monitoring exercise. It will show how the idea and the principles behind the current trade monitoring effort have origins that go back considerably further than the financial crisis. The paper will also provide an overview of selected trends and developments identified by the monitoring exercise since 2009. Finally, the paper will address some of the challenges facing the WTO monitoring exercise as it enters its tenth year.2008年全球金融危机爆发至今已过去十年。在投资银行雷曼兄弟倒闭后不到一个月，世贸组织总干事便成立了秘书处内部特别工作组，以监测与全球金融危机相关的贸易发展情况。2009年初，二十国集团领导人在伦敦会晤时，授权世贸组织与其他国际机构共同监督并公开报告二十国集团抵制保护主义、促进全球贸易和投资的执行情况。经过十年的贸易监测，尽管反贸易言论盛行，但保护主义并未出现大规模回潮。虽然某些贸易限制政策措施的实施确有令人担忧的增长，但总体情况并不像危言耸听者所言那般严峻。本文将介绍世贸组织的贸易监测工作，揭示当前贸易监测背后的理念和原则早在金融危机前就已形成，并概述2009年以来监测中发现的部分趋势和进展。最后，本文还将探讨世贸组织监测工作进入第十年后面临的一些挑战。资源链接: WTOTradeMonitoring Ten Years on - Lessons Learned and Challenges Ahead",

        "content": "In contrast to research showing that private litigation discourages audit clients from disclosing internal control weaknesses, we find that auditors’ litigation concerns have a countervailing effect. Our empirical results show that adverse internal control opinions reduces the likelihood of auditors being implicated in lawsuits against their clients, which suggests that disclosing internal control weaknesses can protect auditors from litigation. Consistent with the notion that such litigation protection in turn encourages auditors to issue adverse internal control opinions, we find that both new and incumbent auditors are more likely to issue adverse internal control opinions for clients with higher ex ante litigation risk. Moreover, for restating firms that eventually acknowledge the existence of internal control weaknesses, ex ante litigation risk is positively associated with earlier adverse internal control opinions. Overall, our evidence suggests that litigation threat provides an incentive rather than a disincentive for auditors to issue adverse internal control opinions in a timely fashion. As both new and incumbent auditors have such incentives, auditors’ litigation concerns suppress clients’ opportunistic internal control opinion shopping.与研究表明私人诉讼会抑制审计客户披露内部控制缺陷不同，我们发现审计师的诉讼担忧会产生抵消效应。实证结果表明，不利的内部控制意见能降低审计师被卷入客户诉讼的概率，这表明披露内部控制缺陷可以保护审计师免受诉讼。与此观点一致的是，这种诉讼保护反过来会促使审计师更倾向于出具不利的内部控制意见——我们发现无论是新任还是现任审计师，对于事前诉讼风险较高的客户都更可能出具此类意见。此外，对于最终承认存在内部控制缺陷的重述企业，事前诉讼风险与早期不利内部控制意见呈正相关。总体而言，我们的证据表明诉讼威胁会激励而非阻碍审计师及时出具不利的内部控制意见。由于新任和现任审计师均存在这种动机，审计师的诉讼关切有效抑制了客户机会主义地挑选内部控制意见的行为。资源链接: Disclosure of InternalControlWeaknesses and Auditors’ LitigationRisk",

However, this policy of nuclear deflection could inadvertently increase the risk of nuclear war and other violent conflict. This article conducts risk-risk tradeoff analysis to assess whether nuclear deflection results in a net increase or decrease in risk. Assuming nonnuclear deflection options are also used, nuclear deflection may only be needed for the largest and most imminent asteroid collisions. These are low-frequency, high-severity events. The effect of nuclear deflection on violent conflict risk is more ambiguous due to the complex and dynamic social factors at play. Indeed, it is not clear whether nuclear deflection would cause a net increase or decrease in violent conflict risk. Similarly, this article cannot reach a precise conclusion on the overall risk-risk tradeoff. The value of this article comes less from specific quantitative conclusions and more from providing an analytical framework and a better overall understanding of the policy decision. The article demonstrates the importance of integrated analysis of global risks and the policies to address them, as well as the challenge of quantitative evaluation of complex social processes such as violent conflict.为防止灾难性小行星撞击地球，有人提议使用核爆炸装置使近地小行星偏离轨道。然而这种核偏转策略可能无意中增加核战争及其他暴力冲突的风险。本文通过风险权衡分析来评估核偏转技术究竟会带来净风险增加还是降低。假设同时采用非核偏转方案，核偏转技术可能仅需用于应对最巨大且最迫在眉睫的小行星撞击——这类事件具有低频高损特性。由于涉及复杂多变的社会因素，核偏转对暴力冲突风险的影响更为模糊，目前尚无法明确其会带来暴力冲突风险的净增加还是降低。同样，本文对整体风险权衡也无法得出精确结论。本文的价值更多在于提供分析框架和提升政策决策的全局认知，而非具体量化结论。研究揭示了全球风险及其应对政策进行综合分析的重要性，同时也展现了暴力冲突等复杂社会过程量化评估的挑战性。资源链接: Risk-RiskTradeoff Analysis of Nuclear Explosives for Asteroid Deflection",

        "content": "The world economy recently witnessed a surge in trade remedies and non-tariff measures (NTMs) as new trade-restrictive measures. This study attempts to provide empirical evidence on the effects of new trade-restrictive measures, such as anti- dumping, countervailing measures, technical barriers to trade, and sanitary and phytosanitary measures on trade. By using the Korean product-level export data and the new NTM data, we find that new trade-restrictive measures in trade can depend on the affected sectors and imposing countries. Exports can be adversely affected by new trade-restrictive measures in their concentrated sectors taken by importing developed countries. We also find the threatening effects of trade remedy before this investigation. However, new trade-restrictive measures imposed by importing developing countries can have positive impact on trade, particularly an increase in consumers’ trust in product quality and decrease in asymmetric information. Results imply that the government of an exporting party should enhance trade policies by considering the heterogeneous effects of new trade-restrictive measures across industries and trading partners.全球经济近期经历了贸易救济和非关税措施（NTMs）作为新贸易限制手段的激增。本研究试图通过反倾销、反补贴措施、技术性贸易壁垒及卫生与植物检疫措施等新型贸易限制手段，实证分析其对贸易的影响。基于韩国产品级出口数据与新型非关税措施数据库，我们发现贸易领域新限制措施的影响因行业特征与实施国别而异。当进口方为发达国家且在重点行业实施时，新型贸易限制措施会对出口产生负面影响。研究还发现贸易救济措施在调查启动前就存在威慑效应。但发展中国家进口方实施的新型贸易限制措施可能产生积极贸易效应，尤其体现在提升消费者对产品质量信任度与降低信息不对称方面。研究结果表明，出口国政府应针对不同行业和贸易伙伴制定差异化政策，以应对新型贸易限制措施的异质性影响。资源链接: NewTradeRestrictiveMeasuresand Exports: Evidence from South Korea",

We derive the time-consistent Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for the equilibrium value function and significantly reduce the number of state variables, which makes the HJB equation derived in this paper much easier to solve than the extended HJB equation in the literature. We illustrate the usefulness of the time-consistent HJB equation with several examples which recover the known results in the literature and go beyond, including a mean-variance model with stochastic volatility dependent risk aversion, a utility deviation-risk model with state dependent risk aversion and control constraint, and a constrained portfolio selection model. The numerical and statistical tests show that the utility and deviation-risk have a significant impact on the equilibrium control strategy and the distribution of the terminal wealth.本文提出了一种统一的效用偏差-风险模型，该模型将效用最大化和均值-方差分析作为特例涵盖其中。我们推导了均衡值函数的时间一致Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman（HJB）方程，并显著减少了状态变量的数量，这使得本文导出的HJB方程比文献中的扩展HJB方程更易于求解。我们通过多个示例说明了时间一致HJB方程的实用性，这些示例不仅重现了文献中的已知结果，还进一步扩展了应用范围，包括具有随机波动率依赖风险厌恶的均值-方差模型、具有状态依赖风险厌恶和控制约束的效用偏差-风险模型，以及一个带约束的投资组合选择模型。数值与统计测试表明，效用和偏差-风险对均衡控制策略及终端财富分布具有显著影响。资源链接: Constrained Utility Deviation-RiskOptimization and Time-consistent HJB Equation",

        "content": "In this work, we have found a risk model that improves the performance of Risk Targeting. Risk Targeting in portfolio construction is implemented to improve capital utilization in growing markets and systematically step away from risk scenarios. However, the performance of risk targeting varies with different implementations of risk estimation. Risk Targeting using recent backward volatility estimates is the most popular risk targeting mechanism but it could not have anticipated a deep crisis like 2008 and it would hurt in range bound situations like the February 2018 drop and bounce back or the December 2018 drop and January 2019 bounce back. The drawbacks of recent volatility are that in such a risk model, short-term volatility is being used to detect a long-term risk event with and short term mean reversion effects are ignored .In this work, we will try to separate risk estimation into two risk models, a long-term risk model that predicts extreme risk scenarios based on macroeconomic data and a short-term risk model that adjusts risk based on short-term mean reversion effects. We then combine the output of the two risk models into a risk measure that enables a risk targeted allocation strategy to outperform static allocation in both crisis periods like 2008 and mean-reverting periods like 2018.Note that risk for a real-money investor is not an expectation of volatility but a measure of the probability  of losing money if one is allocated to that asset class. Hence, we try to forecast a risk value which, if interpreted as a probability of loss, outperforms a baseline estimate of risk.在这项工作中，我们发现了一种能提升风险目标策略表现的风险模型。投资组合构建中的风险目标策略旨在提高增长市场中的资本利用率，并系统性规避风险情景。然而，不同风险估算方法会导致风险目标策略的表现存在差异。采用近期历史波动率估算的风险目标策略是最常见的机制，但它无法预见如2008年的深度危机，且在震荡行情中表现不佳——例如2018年2月暴跌反弹或2018年12月暴跌2019年1月反弹的情形。近期波动率模型的缺陷在于：此类模型使用短期波动率来检测长期风险事件，同时忽略了短期均值回归效应。本研究尝试将风险估算拆分为两个模型：基于宏观经济数据预测极端风险情景的长期风险模型，以及根据短期均值回归效应调整风险的短期风险模型。随后我们将两个模型的输出结果整合为统一风险指标，使得风险目标配置策略在2008年等危机时期和2018年等均值回归时期均能超越静态配置策略。需注意的是，对于实际资金投资者而言，风险并非波动率预期，而是配置该资产类别时发生亏损的概率度量。因此我们尝试预测的风险值若被解读为亏损概率，其表现需优于基线风险估计。资源链接: RegimeDetectionBasedRiskModeling of Asset Classes",

HC has been taken by surprise by soaring energy prices in Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 2018. This has led to (repeated) downgrades of their outlook but no upward move on the learning curve. Instead, HC bets on falling energy prices for the future despite being no expert in these markets. Thus, shareholders are getting a big short position in energy on top of being long cement. Only the latter confirms to the business purpose of HC. HC is not clear on this and equity analysts seem to have little interest neither. No sensitivities to energy prices are reported. Hence, for HC there are more steps to go towards state-of-the-art CRM.根据HC最新的年度报告，我们对其风险管理进行了核查。由于水泥生产属于高能耗过程，能源价格风险成为关注重点。HC在2018年第一、二、三、四季度连续遭遇能源价格飙升的意外冲击，这导致其业绩展望（多次）被下调，但并未推动其风险管理能力的提升。相反，尽管并非能源市场专家，HC仍押注未来能源价格将下跌。这使得股东在持有水泥多头的同时，实质上还持有了能源的空头头寸——唯有前者符合HC的企业宗旨。HC对此缺乏清醒认知，股权分析师似乎也兴趣寥寥。报告中未披露任何针对能源价格的敏感性分析。由此可见，HC要达成一流的全面风险管理仍有很长的路要走。资源链接: A Short Note on CorporateRiskManagement: The Case of HeidelbergCement AG",

        "content": "Services have long been perceived as playing a secondary role in world trade. In particular, the role of services trade policies and multilateral services commitments often tends to be downplayed. However, in value added terms, services account for about 50% of world trade and are significant in exports of countries of all levels of development. In addition, cross-border trade is expanding as a result of technological advances, and the supply of services by foreign affiliates (mode 3) exceeds trade through other modes of supply. Services trade policies, which cover a wide range of ‘inside-the-border’ measures, are an important determinant of foreign direct investment, economy-wide productivity, manufacturing competitiveness and exports, and flows of services value added.This paper underscores, on the basis of recent services data and a growing body of research on the impact of services policies, the role of services trade in economic development, trade integration, and inclusiveness. It argues that the limited attention given to services trade policies and to international commitments is increasingly out of step with the role of services in the global economy. Indeed, services trade policies are often restrictive and multinational commitments are generally modest. Taking steps to raise the profile of services trade within government policy-making would help close this gap and highlight the contribution of services trade policy to a wide range of broader national objectives that have an important services dimension, whether SME and gender policy, or the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).长期以来，服务业在世界贸易中的角色被视为次要。特别是服务贸易政策和多边服务承诺的作用常被低估。然而，从增值角度看，服务业约占全球贸易的50%，对各国出口都具有重要意义。此外，技术进步推动跨境贸易扩展，外国附属机构提供的服务（模式3）已超越其他供应模式。服务贸易政策涵盖广泛的”境内措施”，是影响外国直接投资、整体经济生产率、制造业竞争力及出口、以及服务增值流动的关键因素。本文基于最新服务数据及日益增多的服务政策影响研究，强调服务贸易在经济发展、贸易一体化和包容性方面的作用，指出当前对服务贸易政策及国际承诺的有限关注与服务业在全球经济中的地位日益脱节。事实上，服务贸易政策往往限制较多，多边承诺普遍保守。提升服务贸易在政府决策中的地位将有助于弥合这一差距，并凸显服务贸易政策对诸多国家宏观目标的贡献——无论是中小企业与性别平等政策，还是实现可持续发展目标（SDGs），这些领域都包含重要的服务维度。资源链接: Elevating Services: ServicesTradePolicy, WTO Commitments, and their Role in Economic Development andTradeIntegration",

By 2016, China’s total merchandise trade accounted for 16.1% of the world total, compared to 0.6% in 1978 when its economic reforms were initiated. China’s rapid trade growth was attributable to a series of interrelated factors. This briefing focuses on one of those factors—China’s declining dependence on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in much, but not all, of its trade activity. Using the latest data, and starting from 1995 when official trade statistics became more reliable, this briefing (a) describes SOEs’ declining influence in China’s trade and (b) highlights prominent sectoral exceptions where Chinese SOEs still affect global market conditions.中国的外贸部门是过去四十年里推动其经济强劲增长的主要动力。截至2016年，中国商品贸易总额占全球总量的16.1%，而在1978年经济改革启动之初，这一比例仅为0.6%。中国贸易的快速增长得益于一系列相互关联的因素。本简报重点探讨其中一个因素——中国在大部分（但非全部）贸易活动中对国有企业的依赖度逐步下降。基于自1995年官方贸易统计数据更为可靠以来的最新数据，本简报（1）阐述了国有企业在对外贸易中影响力的减弱；（2）着重分析了中国国企仍对全球市场产生显著影响的重点行业例外情况。资源链接: State-Owned Enterprises Play a Smaller, But Still Strategic, Role in China’s External Sector",

        "tags": "Complexity  maturity  competency  project management  risk management ",
        "content": "The observed phenomenon is that projects in general are failing, and though professional associations have been upgrading project management standards, methodologies and tools, these efforts have not contributed to a general increase in project management success. Projects, systems, products and services are becoming more complex, which inevitably leads to competency and maturity issues. Constant project failures raise questions about the current project risk management concepts, practices, people, behaviour, contextual, and technology issues required to achieve consistency and the successful delivery of projects.An inquiry into Eskom, South Africa’s dominant electricity generator and supplier, found that the conventional project management processes aggravate the risk of management incompetence when dealing with complex projects where uncertainty and risk are perceived to be higher. When training project risk management practitioners, Eskom does not apply a holistic approach that considers the impact of complexity, maturity and competency on projects and their performance. The skills and competency requirements are not stipulated when the risk advisor moves to a more senior advisory role in low-complexity projects, and from there into high-complexity projects. Eskom’s ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to competency development does not consider the fact that projects have different complexities.The researcher sought to ascertain whether there is a relationship between complexity, maturity and competency in project risk management and if so, to determine whether such a relationship affects the performance of projects.An interpretive and subjective research philosophy was adopted, using inductive reasoning and a qualitative research approach to probe the literature. The researcher applied field research with participative action research for the interviews and a qualitative survey to collect data and verify the findings of the literature review. A semi-structured questionnaire was used for in-depth interviews with six Eskom senior managers. Stratified sampling was used for the collection of data from 207 Eskom project risk management practitioners. They were invited to respond to the web-based survey comprising a questionnaire with multiple-choice questions on project and project risk management. Eighty project risk management practitioners responded to the survey. Further, a checklist of possible project risk management competencies was emailed to project management experts in Eskom and national and international project management associations for their input.Thematic analysis and content analysis were applied as the qualitative method of analysis. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and coded, and the web-based survey responses were categorised, analysed and interpreted to create an analytical narrative about the present project and project risk management situation in Eskom. The themes or commonalities discovered in the literature and field research, as well as the competency unit criteria from the updated checklist, was used to populate three matrices (technical, contextual and behavioural) for comparison purposes.The research findings indicated that project complexity is driven by the interaction of management, systems and the product delivered. All projects have some level of complexity and Eskom should acknowledge differing complexities. Competency development includes the development of technical, contextual and behavioural competencies. Most importantly, there is a notable relationship between complexity, maturity and competency in the project environment. These findings led to the creation of a sense-making framework in which the relationships between the research elements, their sub-elements and project risk management were combined to indicate how such a relationship could lead to the successful execution of projects. The final outcome of the research is a competency framework to guide the development of project risk practitioners.Recommendations from the research findings are that project performance can be improved by constantly enhancing the competencies of project risk practitioners and by introducing a defined career path in which the different types of projects are considered. Eskom should instil a project risk management culture to ensure maturity of the organisation and sensitivity to the varying levels of complexity in projects.观察到的现象是，项目普遍面临失败，尽管专业协会一直在升级项目管理标准、方法和工具，但这些努力并未推动项目管理成功率的整体提升。项目、系统、产品和服务正变得日益复杂，这不可避免地引发了能力与成熟度问题。持续的项目失败引发了对当前项目风险管理理念、实践、人员、行为、环境及技术问题的质疑——这些要素本应确保项目交付的一致性与成功。对南非主要电力供应商Eskom的调查发现，在处理不确定性和风险更高的复杂项目时，传统项目管理流程会加剧管理失能的风险。Eskom在培训项目风险管理从业者时，并未采用综合考虑复杂性、成熟度及能力对项目及其表现影响的整体方法。当风险顾问从低复杂度项目晋升至高级顾问职位，再进入高复杂度项目时，其技能与能力要求缺乏明确规定。Eskom”一刀切”的能力发展模式忽视了项目复杂程度的差异性。研究者试图验证项目风险管理中复杂性、成熟度与能力之间是否存在关联，并探究这种关联是否影响项目表现。研究采用解释性主观哲学，通过归纳推理与定性方法梳理文献，结合参与式行动研究的实地访谈及定性调查收集数据。半结构化问卷用于对6名Eskom高管的深度访谈，分层抽样则用于收集207名Eskom项目风险管理从业者的数据，其中80人完成了包含多选题的在线调查。另将项目风险管理能力清单通过邮件发送给Eskom及国内外项目管理协会专家征求意见。采用主题分析与内容分析等定性方法处理数据：访谈记录经转录编码，网络调查反馈经分类解析，最终形成关于Eskom当前项目及风险管理现状的分析报告。通过文献与实地研究发现的共性主题，结合更新后的能力清单标准，研究者构建了技术、情境和行为三维矩阵进行对比。研究发现：项目复杂性由管理、系统及交付产品的交互作用驱动；所有项目均存在复杂度差异，Eskom需正视这一点；能力发展应涵盖技术、情境及行为维度；最重要的是，项目环境中复杂性、成熟度与能力存在显著关联。这些发现促成构建意义建构框架，将研究要素及其子要素与项目风险管理的关系整合，揭示其如何推动项目成功实施。最终成果是指导风险从业者发展的能力框架。研究建议：通过持续提升风险从业者能力，并建立考虑项目类型差异的明确职业路径，可改善项目表现；Eskom应培育风险管理文化，以提升组织成熟度及对项目复杂性的敏感度。资源链接: Complexity, Maturity and Competency in the ProjectRiskManagementEnvironment: A Relational Framework",

The multi-method research approach was employed to collect research data. An in-depth literature review was used to acquire data from six managers in the project risk management field. This was followed by a self-completion web-based survey that was forwarded to 207 project risk management practitioners. A checklist was applied to triangulate the interview and web-survey findings for further development of a framework. Multi-method analysis techniques were applied for the interpretation of the data sets from the interviews and responses to the web-based questionnaire namely, thematic and content analysis. The outcome of the research is the production of a sense-making framework and recommendations for enhanced project risk management. The research for this paper was based on information from the original doctoral thesis.本文旨在确定项目风险管理中的复杂性、成熟度与能力之间是否存在关联，并据此构建一个意义构建框架，以帮助项目经理更好地理解这一概念。研究采用多方法研究途径收集数据：首先通过深度文献综述获取六位项目风险管理领域管理者的访谈数据，随后向207名项目风险管理从业者发放了自填式网络问卷。研究运用核查清单对访谈和网络调查结果进行三角验证，以进一步完善框架构建。数据分析采用多方法分析技术（主题分析与内容分析）对访谈记录和网络问卷反馈进行解读。最终成果包括一个意义构建框架及优化项目风险管理的建议。本研究基于原始博士论文中的信息展开。资源链接: Applying Multi-Methods Research within the Context of ProjectRiskManagement",

One of the biggest administrative problems with internal projects is the managers’ neglect of the importance of risk management which leads to delay in projects delivery and increase of the cost of the projects. Since not all risks are regarded as threats but also as opportunities, risk management is considered as a balance factor between the loss of threats and the profit earned through opportunities. It has focused on some strategies for successful implementation of risk management in projects as well. In the risk management, the most logical way of planning is managing risk before taking risk. This study investigated risk and risk management, its aims, components, and different stages of risk to reach the expected aims and outcomes of the study.风险被视为任何项目中不可分割的一部分，由于并非所有项目中的有效因素都可预测，风险管理是不可避免的。内部项目最大的管理问题之一是管理者忽视了风险管理的重要性，这导致项目交付延迟和项目成本增加。由于并非所有风险都被视为威胁，同时也被视为机遇，风险管理被视为威胁造成的损失与通过机遇获得的利润之间的平衡因素。它还关注了一些在项目中成功实施风险管理的策略。在风险管理中，最合理的规划方式是在承担风险之前管理风险。本研究探讨了风险与风险管理、其目标、组成部分以及风险的不同阶段，以达到研究的预期目标和结果。资源链接: An Investigation ofRiskManagementStrategies in Projects",

Given that the common factor ingredients can be highly skewed, we specifically incorporate the notion of tail risk management into the construction of multi-asset multi-factor portfolios. Indeed, we find that the minimum CVaR concentration approach of Boudt, Carl and Peterson (2013) effectively mitigates the dangers of tail risk concentrations. Yet, diversifying across multiple assets and style factors can be in and of itself a good means of tail risk management, irrespective of the risk-based allocation technique employed.多资产多因子投资组合的配置通常以基于风险的分配模式为核心，往往力求维持相等的波动性风险预算。鉴于常见因子成分可能存在高度偏态，我们特别将尾部风险管理理念纳入多资产多因子组合的构建中。实际上，我们发现Boudt、Carl和Peterson（2013）提出的最小CVaR集中度方法能有效缓解尾部风险集中的隐患。然而，无论采用何种基于风险的配置技术，跨越多资产与风格因子进行分散化配置本身即可成为管理尾部风险的有效手段。资源链接: TailRiskManagementfor Multi-Asset Multi-Factor Strategies",

The ten risk indicators are daily time series measuring various risks in the large value payment system, such as operational risk, concentration risk and liquidity flows related to other financial market infrastructures. We use extreme value theory and local outlier factor methods to identify anomalous data points (outliers). In a univariate setup, the extreme value analysis quantifies the unusualness of each outlier. In a multivariate setup, the local outlier factor method identifies outliers by measuring the local deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbours. We find that most detected outliers are at the beginning and near end of the calendar month when turnover is significantly larger than at other days. Our method can be used e.g. by overseers and financial stability experts who wish to look at many (risk) indicators in relation to each other.本文研究基于大额支付系统交易数据的风险指标异常值检测。这十个风险指标是衡量大额支付系统中各类风险的日度时间序列，包括操作风险、集中度风险以及与其他金融市场基础设施相关的流动性流动等。我们运用极值理论和局部离群因子方法来识别异常数据点（离群值）。在单变量分析框架下，极值分析量化了每个离群值的异常程度；在多变量分析框架下，局部离群因子方法通过测量给定数据点相对于其邻近点的局部偏差来识别离群值。研究发现，大多数被检测到的离群值出现在日历月初和临近月末时点，这些时点的交易量显著高于其他日期。本方法可供监管者和金融稳定专家使用，尤其适用于需要关联分析多个（风险）指标的场景。资源链接: OutlierDetectionin TARGET2RiskIndicators",

        "content": "This paper presents reflections on the use of risk analysis for understanding and informing policy decisions about nuclear war. A quantitative evaluation of risk arguably should be central to many important nuclear weapons decisions, such as disarmament and launch alert status, because these decisions involve tradeoffs between different risks. However, nuclear war is a difficult risk to analyze, little effort has been made to analyze it, and nuclear war policy decisions have made little use of risk analysis. The paper demonstrates this via a detailed review of the nuclear war risk literature, a summary of a new model for nuclear war risk produced by the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute, and a discussion of the use of risk analysis in nuclear war decision-making. Despite the challenges, there are significant opportunities for progress on both the analysis and the decision-making. The paper finds that, at this time, the limiting factor is mainly the use of risk analysis for decision-making, such that people working on nuclear war risk should emphasize outreach to decision-makers. The paper’s discussion is of relevance for guiding efforts to understand and reduce nuclear war risk, and is likewise applicable to many other risks, especially other global catastrophic risks.本文探讨了运用风险分析来理解和指导核战争政策决策的思考。定量风险评估理应成为许多重要核武器决策的核心，例如裁军和发射警戒状态，因为这些决策涉及不同风险之间的权衡。然而，核战争是一种难以分析的风险，相关分析工作鲜有开展，且核战争政策决策也极少运用风险分析。本文通过详细梳理核战争风险文献、总结全球灾难性风险研究所提出的新型核战争风险模型，并讨论风险分析在核战争决策中的应用，对此进行了论证。尽管存在挑战，但在风险分析和决策应用方面仍存在重大发展机遇。研究发现，当前限制因素主要在于决策过程中对风险分析的运用，因此核战争风险研究者应着重加强与决策者的沟通。本文的讨论对指导核战争风险认知与降低工作具有现实意义，其方法论同样适用于其他诸多风险领域，尤其是其他全球性灾难风险。资源链接: Reflections on theRiskAnalysis of Nuclear War",

        "content": "Recently, strategic protective trade policies are emerging. The strategic choices are a result of asymmetric information on demand parameters and a firm’s cost structure. In this paper, we will suggest the optimal policy of eliciting private information from domestic firms. The policy is a contract of menus, comprising a tariff and a production subsidy (henceforth, subsidy). When one domestic firm and another foreign firm compete in a duopolistic domestic market, we consider unilateral intervention of the domestic government. The domestic firm privately holds information on the industrial cost structure. The main findings are as follows. First, the two policies can be equivalent conditionally. We will provide conditions for equivalence. Second, the domestic firm has an incentive to misreport the industrial cost structure to the government. Using a menu of a tariff and a subsidy (in combination with a lump-sum transfer), the government can screen the domestic firm’s marginal cost. That is, the menu leads the domestic firm to disclose private information.近来，战略性保护贸易政策逐渐兴起。这些策略选择源于需求参数与企业成本结构之间的信息不对称。本文旨在提出一种最优政策，用以从国内企业获取私有信息。该政策采用菜单式合同形式，包含关税与生产补贴（以下简称补贴）的组合。当一家国内企业与一家国外企业在双寡头垄断的国内市场竞争时，我们考虑本国政府的单边干预行为。国内企业私有掌握着行业成本结构信息。主要研究发现如下：首先，两种政策在特定条件下可相互替代，我们将给出等价条件；其次，国内企业存在向政府虚报行业成本结构的动机。通过采用关税与补贴的组合菜单（配合定额转移支付），政府能够甄别国内企业的边际成本。这意味着该菜单机制将引导国内企业披露私有信息。资源链接: Strategic ProtectiveTradePolicy Under Asymmetric Information",

This paper compared the IIT data of Korea and selected MENA countries. The Grubel and Lloyd index was calculated using the COMTRADE data during the period of 1995-2015 to compare the dynamics of IIT flows under each free trade agreement (FTA) regime. IIT flows did not show much change in patterns in the case of Algeria and Saudi- Arabia. In particular, it was found that the FTA of Algeria with the EU did not affect the trade structure. The comparative advantage of Algeria and Saudi-Arabia remains in their primary commodities reflecting a narrow industrial base. But the IIT flows of Turkey exhibited that Turkey had been integrating into the global value chain system after its FTA with the EU. These results are in accordance with the findings of Bülhart (2008) indicating that the positive association between IIT and income is not universal. As for Korea, its IIT flows shows that the Korea economy has become deeply integrated with the EU and the USA following its FTA. Overall, the IIT flows have been advancing to a high level of trade structure.行业内贸易（IIT）反映了一个经济体与世界经济的融合程度及其在全球价值链中的地位。本文比较了韩国与部分中东和北非国家的行业内贸易数据，采用Grubel和Lloyd指数测算1995-2015年期间COMTRADE数据库的贸易动态，对比不同自由贸易协定（FTA）框架下的行业内贸易变化趋势。阿尔及利亚和沙特阿拉伯的行业内贸易模式未呈现显著变化，特别是阿尔及利亚与欧盟的自由贸易协定未对其贸易结构产生影响。两国仍保持初级产品的比较优势，反映出其狭窄的工业基础。而土耳其的行业内贸易数据表明，该国在与欧盟签订自贸协定后正逐步融入全球价值链体系。这些发现与Bülhart（2008）的研究结论相符，证实行业内贸易与收入水平之间的正向关联并不具有普遍性。就韩国而言，其行业内贸易数据显示，在签订自贸协定后，韩国经济已深度融入欧盟和美国市场。总体而言，韩国的行业内贸易正朝着更高层次的贸易结构演进。资源链接: Comparative Intra-IndustryTradeAnalysis on the Asymmetric Effects of the FTA: Korea and MENA Countries",

We find that banks that disclose a material weakness in internal controls have higher risk-taking and worse performance in the future, including having a higher (lower) likelihood of experiencing large losses (gains). These findings suggest that weak controls increase (reduce) downside (upside) risk-taking or conversely that strong controls increase (reduce) upside (downside) risk-taking. Path analyses suggest that 22.3 to 43.7 percent of the effect of internal control quality on future performance is through risk-taking. Additionally, material weaknesses are negatively associated with total asset, loan, interest income, and non-interest income growth, suggesting that internal control quality affects both core and non-core activities of banks. Overall, results suggest that strong internal controls improve bank risk-taking, in part through asymmetrically reducing downside risk-taking while facilitating upside risk-taking, ultimately improving bank performance.我们利用2005年至2017年的银行年度样本，研究了内部控制质量对未来风险承担和绩效的影响。研究发现，披露内部控制重大缺陷的银行在未来会承担更高风险且表现更差，具体表现为发生大额损失（收益）的概率更高（更低）。这些发现表明，薄弱的控制会增加（减少）下行（上行）风险承担，反之强有力的控制则会提升（抑制）上行（下行）风险承担。路径分析显示，内部控制质量对未来绩效的影响中有22.3%至43.7%是通过风险承担渠道实现的。此外，重大缺陷与总资产、贷款、利息收入及非利息收入的增长呈负相关，表明内部控制质量同时影响银行的核心与非核心业务。总体而言，研究结果表明强有力的内部控制能改善银行风险承担行为，其机制部分体现为不对称地抑制下行风险承担同时促进上行风险承担，最终提升银行绩效。资源链接: InternalControlQuality and BankRisk-Taking and Performance",

        "content": "This article inputs into a research project on the law’s approach to geophysical phenomena of full movement – full movement that is produced by man but which man is unable to control. The concept of full movement beyond control can be illustrated in several domains. The more specific areas of environmental protection and sustainable development highlight two significant examples: the movement of greenhouse gas and the movement of waste.  The hypothesis proposed here is that there exists a silent risk of full movement beyond control. Even as a discernible and potentially measurable phenomenon, the risk of full and beyond control is commonly denied or underestimated. Its treatment is generally based on the illusion that, since it is man who created the movement, he will always have the ability to regain control of it. This flawed approach to the risk explains many of the difficulties encountered in environmental governance matters, particularly in the area of sustainable development and especially when such difficulties motivate the rule of law. Using the idea of silent risk may also be useful for granting full movement beyond control the transversal and inclusive place it warrants.本文为一项关于法律如何应对完全运动的地球物理现象的研究项目提供了输入。所谓完全运动，指的是由人类引发但人类无法控制的运动。失控的完全运动这一概念可在多个领域中得以阐明。环境保护与可持续发展这两个具体领域尤为突出地体现了两个重要实例：温室气体的运动和废弃物的运动。本文提出的假设是，失控的完全运动存在一种隐性风险。即便作为一种可识别且可能量化的现象，完全且失控的风险通常被否认或低估。对其处理往往基于一种错觉：既然是人类创造了这种运动，人类就始终有能力重新掌控它。这种对风险的错误认知解释了许多环境治理事务中遇到的困难，尤其是在可持续发展领域，特别是当这些困难推动法治进程时。运用隐性风险的概念，或许也有助于赋予失控的完全运动应有的横向包容地位。资源链接: Full Movement BeyondControland Environmental Governance: Taking SilentRiskSeriously",

        "content": "This paper looks at the extent to which the shift in the lower value added production to countries in the following development “tier” is actually becoming a reality. Several countries in East Asia have been upgrading production patterns and moving up the value chain, this paper looks at how this helps and offers new opportunities to less advanced countries to integrate in world trade. The paper uses a combination of techniques, from an analysis of disaggregated trade flows by country and sectors, to the calculation of trade intensity indices by country and sector, and value-added trade by sector. It finds combined evidence of forward and backward trade increasing between several neighbouring Asian economies and China, in the most labour-intensive industries in particular. Econometric analysis shows that relative unit labour costs are an explanatory factor of increased trade links. In cases, the intensification of trade links on the export side can relate to a strongly expanding local market (for example India for electronic products such as smartphones), but mostly the intensification of trade links takes place both on the import and export sides with markets which are much smaller than China (Vietnam, Bangladesh, etc.), and which experienced increased outward-processing activities as a result of China’s production upgrade.本文探讨了低附加值生产向下一发展“梯队”国家转移的程度是否正在成为现实。东亚多个国家正通过升级生产模式向价值链上游攀升，研究分析了这一趋势如何为欠发达国家融入世界贸易提供助力与新机遇。论文综合运用多种分析方法，包括分国别和行业的贸易流量解析、国别与行业的贸易强度指数测算，以及分行业的增加值贸易核算。研究发现，在劳动密集型产业领域，多个亚洲邻近经济体与中国之间的前向和后向贸易均呈现增长态势。计量经济分析表明，相对单位劳动力成本是贸易联系增强的解释性因素。某些情况下，出口端贸易联系的强化可能与快速扩张的本地市场相关（如印度智能手机等电子产品市场），但多数贸易联系的增强同时发生在进出口两端，且对象是远小于中国规模的市场（如越南、孟加拉等国），这些国家因中国产业升级而承接了更多外包加工活动。资源链接: RecentTradeDynamics in Asia: Examples from Specific Industries",

It is pointed up that an appropriate quantification of all relevant risks and a risk aggregation by the monte carlo simulation are both crucial for an efficient risk management.Also an impression of the basics for the organization of risk management systems is given and the main aspects of risk coping and risk control are explained.Overall, a modern, „decision-oriented“ risk management is portrayed which is able to predict changes due to decisions in the risk-return profile of the company already during the process of preparing those decisions (e.g. in terms of investment or acquisitions).文章阐明了风险管理的最基本方法，尤其包括风险识别、量化以及基于模拟的风险聚合方法（如蒙特卡洛模拟）。文中强调，对所有相关风险的适当量化以及通过蒙特卡洛模拟进行风险聚合，对于高效的风险管理至关重要。同时，文章还介绍了风险管理体系组织的基础知识，并解释了风险应对和风险控制的主要方面。总体而言，文章描绘了一种现代、“决策导向型”的风险管理，它能够在决策准备过程中（如投资或收购决策时）预测这些决策对公司风险回报状况的影响变化。资源链接: RiskManagement– The Basics",

        "content": "Risk management is a critical core issue among a variety of traditional financial institutions. Different institutions have grown with different objectives under different settings, and risk management has different historical strands of focus in institutions. This chapter reviews the traditional and evolving needs of the risk management function in light of the profound changes unfolding in the structural economic environment and the regulatory setting. Rapid consolidation and globalization in the past two decades have led to the evolution of deeply capitalized universal financial institutions that are home to a wide variety of products previously compartmentalized from Depression-era regulation. The development of a unifying framework for risk management to accommodate products and structures from disparate settings of the past is a major challenge. Adequacy and accuracy of risk measures have to be reevaluated for the current environment. The chapter discusses some alternatives that seem to be evolving in the market. Emphasis on standardization of risk measures across different products to accommodate aggregation is another challenge that has to be continually addressed.风险管理是众多传统金融机构的核心关键议题。不同机构在不同环境下以不同目标发展壮大，风险管理在各机构中形成了差异化的历史关注脉络。本章结合经济结构环境和监管体系正在发生的深刻变革，回顾了风险管理职能的传统需求与演变趋势。过去二十年间快速推进的整合与全球化浪潮，催生了资本雄厚的全能型金融机构，这些机构汇聚了曾被大萧条时期监管政策分隔管理的各类金融产品。如何构建统一的风险管理框架以兼容历史不同时期形成的产品与结构，成为重大挑战。风险计量方法的适当性与精确性也需根据当前环境重新评估。本章探讨了市场上正在形成的一些替代方案。强调跨产品风险计量标准化以实现风险聚合，则是需要持续应对的另一项挑战。资源链接: Emerging Trends inRiskReporting",

        "content": "Concerns about a possible turn of the global trade policy agenda are on the rise. Indeed, even if tariffs are at a historically low levels, non-tariff measures (NTMs) play an important – and growing – role in global trade policy. In this paper, using a recently released database on NTMs (UNCTAD), and relying on a gravity model, we focus on Chinese exports with two aims in mind: the first is to test for possible heterogeneous effects of different type of NTMs. The second is to verify empirically whether NTMs have larger negative effects for specific set of goods, i.e. final goods. We find that 1) technical NTMs tend to have positive effects on trade flows, whereas non-technical NTMs do not have clear effects at the aggregate level and 2) NTMs have heterogeneous effects at the product level: in the case of final goods, non-technical NTMs have negative and significant effects.对全球贸易政策议程可能转向的担忧正在加剧。事实上，即便当前关税处于历史低位，非关税措施(NTMs)在全球贸易政策中正发挥着日益重要的作用。本文基于联合国贸发会议最新发布的非关税措施数据库，运用引力模型聚焦中国出口贸易，旨在实现双重目标：首先检验不同类型非关税措施可能存在的异质性影响，其次实证验证非关税措施是否对特定商品类别（如最终产品）产生更显著的负面效应。研究发现：1) 技术性非关税措施往往对贸易流量产生积极影响，而非技术性措施在总量层面未呈现明确效应；2) 非关税措施在产品层面存在异质性影响——针对最终产品时，非技术性措施会产生显著负面效应。资源链接: Chinese Exports and Non-TariffMeasures: Testing for Heterogeneous Effects at the Product Level",

        "content": "This paper studies the risk of collision between asteroids and Earth. It focuses on uncertainty in the human consequences of asteroid collisions, with emphasis on the possibility of global catastrophe to human civilization. A detailed survey of the asteroid risk literature shows that while human consequences are recognized as a major point of uncertainty, the studies focus mainly on physical and environmental dimensions of the risk. Some potential human consequences are omitted entirely, such as the possibility of asteroid explosions inadvertently causing nuclear war. Other human consequences are modeled with varying degrees of detail. Direct medical effects are relatively well-characterized, while human consequences of global environmental effects are more uncertain. The latter are evaluated mainly in terms of a global catastrophe threshold, but such a threshold is deeply uncertain and may not even exist. To handle threshold uncertainty in asteroid policy, this paper adapts the concept of policy boundaries from literature on anthropogenic global environmental change (i.e., planetary boundaries). The paper proposes policy boundaries of 100m asteroid diameter for global environmental effects and 1m for inadvertent nuclear war. Other policy implications include a more aggressive asteroid risk mitigation policy and measures to avoid inadvertent nuclear war. The paper argues that for rare events like large asteroid collisions, the absence of robust data means that a wide range of possible human consequences should be considered. This implies humility for risk analysis and erring on the side of caution in policy.本文研究了小行星与地球相撞的风险，重点关注小行星撞击对人类影响的不确定性，尤其是对人类文明造成全球性灾难的可能性。通过对小行星风险文献的系统梳理发现，尽管人类影响被公认为主要的不确定因素，但现有研究仍集中于风险的物理与环境维度。某些潜在的人类影响被完全忽略，例如小行星爆炸意外引发核战争的可能性。其他人类影响的建模精细程度参差不齐——直接的医学效应已得到较好刻画，而全球环境效应引发的人类后果则存在更大不确定性。后者主要通过全球灾难阈值进行评估，但该阈值本身具有高度不确定性，甚至可能根本不存在。为应对小行星政策中的阈值不确定性，本文借鉴了人为全球环境变化研究（即行星边界理论）中的政策边界概念，提出针对全球环境效应的政策边界设为100米直径小行星，针对意外核战争的边界设为1米。其他政策建议包括实施更积极的小行星风险缓解政策，以及防范意外核战争的措施。本文指出，对于大型小行星撞击等罕见事件，由于缺乏可靠数据，应考虑各种可能的人类影响。这意味着风险分析需保持谦逊态度，政策制定应秉持谨慎原则。资源链接: Uncertain Human Consequences in AsteroidRiskAnalysis and the Global Catastrophe Threshold",

        "content": "Financial and operational risk management are central concepts at the intersection of finance, operations, and commodity risk management.  Yet, empirical evidence on their effects on inventory is lacking.  We use a fine-grained data set comprising the financial and operational risk management decisions of gold miners from 2003 to 2011 to empirically assess the effects of risk management on inventory.  Faced with volatile gold prices, miners may manage (output) risk financially by committing to sell future gold production and lock in prices.  They may also manage (input) costs operationally by varying the quality of ore they extract and process, thereby altering the costs they incur and influencing inventory holdings.  In addition to affecting profitability, we show that these two risk management strategies have implications for inventory holdings. We find that a one-standard deviation increase in financial risk management (FRM) is associated with an 14.3% decrease in inventory, as FRM decreases the option value of delaying processing inventory. On the other hand, a one-standard deviation increase in operational risk management (ORM) is associated with a 3.5% increase in inventory.  We also find evidence that, in this context, FRM and ORM could be viewed as complements.财务与运营风险管理是金融、运营及商品风险管理交叉领域的核心概念。然而，关于它们对库存影响的实证证据仍属空白。我们利用2003至2011年间金矿企业财务与运营风险管理决策的细粒度数据集，实证评估了风险管理对库存的影响。面对波动的金价，矿企可通过承诺出售未来黄金产量并锁定价格来实施（产出端）财务风险管理；也可通过调整开采和加工矿石的品质来实施（投入端）运营风险管理，从而改变成本支出并影响库存持有量。研究表明，这两种风险管理策略除影响盈利能力外，还会对库存持有产生显著影响：财务风险管理（FRM）每增加一个标准差，库存量会减少14.3%，因为FRM降低了延迟加工库存的期权价值；而运营风险管理（ORM）每增加一个标准差，库存量则增加3.5%。我们还发现证据表明，在此情境下FRM与ORM可被视为互补策略。资源链接: Financial and OperationalRiskManagement: Inventory Effects in the Gold Mining Industry",

Design/methodology/approach − This conceptual paper synthesizes ERM research and practice from multiple disciplines. Findings − Corporate risk management concepts were born in academic finance and developed further in the finance subset known as risk management and insurance. With the advent of ERM, efforts must broaden beyond applying statistical models to quantifiable risks. Other disciplines have expanded ERM research by embracing techniques to investigate risk management practices to produce knowledge that integrates practice and theory. ERM is promoted as integrated risk management, yet silos still remain in both practice and research. Originality/value − Provides a foundation and a proposal for moving ERM past academic and organizational silos, which is necessary to achieve the ERM philosophy and increase organizational resilience. Understanding the evolution and fragmented nature of ERM research and practice provides a foundation for interdisciplinary cooperation necessary to achieve the holistic ERM philosophy. A next frontier is effective ERM implementation. This paper argues for an organizational design science approach for mitigating the resistance to change that confounds effective implementation of ERM in organizations facing an increasingly uncertain environment and outlines future research for applying the approach to implementing the ISO 31000 risk management process.目的——本文探讨了企业风险管理（ERM）如何从分散的学科视角中演变而来，为促进跨学科研究奠定基础，并提出一种设计科学方法以更有效地在组织中实施ERM。  . 设计/方法论/途径——本概念性论文综合了多学科领域的ERM研究与实务。  . 研究结果——企业风险管理概念起源于学术金融领域，并在金融学的风险管理与保险分支中进一步发展。随着ERM的出现，相关研究必须超越对可量化风险应用统计模型的范畴。其他学科通过采用调查风险管理实践的技术扩展了ERM研究，从而产生了整合实践与理论的知识体系。尽管ERM被倡导为整合性风险管理，但在实践和研究中仍存在壁垒。  . 原创性/价值——为突破ERM在学术界和组织中的壁垒提供了基础与方案，这对实现ERM理念和增强组织韧性至关重要。理解ERM研究与实践的演变过程及碎片化特征，为实现整体性ERM理念所需的跨学科合作奠定了基础。有效实施ERM是下一个前沿领域。本文主张采用组织设计科学方法来缓解变革阻力——这种阻力困扰着在日益不确定环境中实施ERM的组织，并概述了未来应用该方法实施ISO 31000风险管理流程的研究方向。资源链接: EnterpriseRiskManagement: History and a Design-Science Proposal",

It defines as well as distinguishes multi-level Cognitive Computing process engineering frameworks of Artificial Intelligence (AI) &amp; Machine Learning as applied in KM practices of US and worldwide firms, governments, and ISR agencies from Cognitive-Neuromorphic Chips. A recent IEEE Spectrum report also published as “The Neuromorphic Chip’s Make-or-Break Moment” observes that “Neuromorphic Chips Are Destined for Deep Learning—or Obscurity” given that the Neuromorphic Chip researchers “have hitched their wagon to deep learning’s star.” Drawing upon insights on Model Risk Management and Anticipatory Risk Analytics focus of top Wall Street investment banks and hedge funds beyond the Global Financial Crisis currently guiding national and global Cyber Risk Insurance industry practices, we demonstrate how Model Risk Management (MRM) and Anticipatory Risk Analytics are even more critical in the global and national domains of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR). The first operational use of AI and Deep Learning AI technologies in the Defense Intelligence Enterprise led by Project Maven and Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team is used as a case study for illustrating how Anticipatory Risk Analytics &amp; MRM assume even greater significance at the  intersections of Space and Cyberspace wherein Offensive and Defensive Cybersecurity strategies, such as discussed in the recent 2015 and 2016 presentations at the Princeton Quant Trading Conference, are deployed.借鉴麻省理工学院“人工智能与机器学习：管理与领导力”实践学习社区的分享见解，当前的情报、监视与侦察（ISR）演示进一步聚焦于“人与计算机的集体智能”，这一概念置于认知计算在ISR领域进行预见性风险分析的背景下。该演示定义并区分了人工智能（AI）与机器学习在美国及全球企业、政府和ISR机构知识管理（KM）实践中应用的多层次认知计算流程工程框架，以及与认知神经形态芯片的差异。近期《IEEE综览》发表的《神经形态芯片的成败时刻》报告指出，“神经形态芯片要么成就深度学习，要么沦为 obscurity”，因为相关研究者“已将未来押注于深度学习的星辰”。  基于全球金融危机后华尔街顶级投行和对冲基金在模型风险管理与预见性风险分析方面的实践，这些经验目前正指导着国家和全球网络风险保险行业的运作。我们展示了模型风险管理（MRM）与预见性风险分析在ISR的全球及国家层面更为关键的作用。以“专家计划”和算法战跨职能团队主导的国防情报体系中首次实战应用AI与深度学习技术为例，本研究通过案例阐明：在太空与网络空间交汇处部署攻防网络安全战略（如2015及2016年普林斯顿量化交易会议所述）时，预见性风险分析与MRM的重要性尤为凸显。资源链接: Cognitive-Neuromorphic Computing for AnticipatoryRiskAnalytics in Intelligence, Surveillance &amp; Reconnaissance (ISR): ModelRiskManagementin Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine Learning (Presentation Slides)",

Experts often disagree on the efficacy of these regulations. Compounding this problem banks regard their trade data required for a full analysis as proprietary. We adapt a simulation technology combining advances in graph theory to randomly generate entire financial systems sampled from realistic distributions with a novel open source risk engine to compute risks in financial systems under different regulations. This allows us to consistently evaluate, predict and optimize the impact of financial regulations on all levels - from a single trade to systemic risk - before it is implemented. The resulting data set is accessible to contemporary data science techniques like data mining, anomaly detection and visualization. We find that collateralization reduces the costs of resolving a financial system in crisis, yet it does not change the distribution of those costs and can have adverse effects on individual participants in extreme situations.本文模拟并分析了衍生品交易抵押相关金融监管对系统性风险的影响——这一议题自2007/08年金融危机以来一直备受热议。专家们对这些监管措施的有效性常有分歧，而银行又将全面分析所需的交易数据视为商业机密，使得问题更为复杂。我们采用结合图论进展的模拟技术，从现实分布中随机生成完整金融体系样本，并运用新型开源风险引擎计算不同监管下金融体系的风险。这种方法使我们能在政策实施前，从单笔交易到系统性风险的各个层面，持续评估、预测和优化金融监管的影响。生成的数据集适用于当代数据科学技术，如数据挖掘、异常检测和可视化。研究发现，抵押品制度虽能降低危机中金融体系的处置成本，但不会改变这些成本的分布，且在极端情况下可能对个别参与者产生不利影响。资源链接: A Data Science Approach to Predict the Impact of Collateralization on SystemicRisk",

        "content": "In this paper, we propose a general modeling framework for operational risk management of financial firms. We consider operational risk events as shocks to a financial firm’s value process, and then study capital investments in preventive and corrective controls to mitigate risk losses. The optimal decisions would be made under three scenarios: (i) preventive control only, (ii) corrective control only, and (iii) joint controls. We characterize the optimal control policies under a general modeling framework under these three scenarios, and then discuss an exponential risk reduction function. We conclude our work with an implementation of our model to a data set from a commercial bank. We find that through a proper investment strategy, we can achieve a significant performance improvement, especially when the risk severity level is high. At the bank we analyze, we find that within a certain range of the frequency reduction efficiency we can achieve up to 2.5% improvement in the expected bank revenue; within a proper range of risk severity reduction efficiency, we can achieve an improvement of up to 1.5%. In general, our modeling framework, which combines a typical operational risk process with stochastic control, may suggest a new research direction in operations management and operational risk management.本文提出了一种适用于金融机构操作风险管理的通用建模框架。我们将操作风险事件视为对金融机构价值过程的冲击，进而研究预防性控制和纠正性控制的资本投入以降低风险损失。最优决策将在三种情境下制定：（i）仅采取预防性控制，（ii）仅采取纠正性控制，以及（iii）联合采取两种控制。我们在这三种情境下构建了通用框架下的最优控制策略特征，随后探讨了指数型风险削减函数。最后通过商业银行数据集的模型实证完成研究。研究发现，通过合理的投资策略能实现显著的绩效提升，尤其在风险严重程度较高时更为明显。在分析的银行案例中，当风险频率削减效率处于特定区间时，预期银行收益最高可提升2.5%；在适当的风险严重程度削减效率范围内，最高可获得1.5%的改善。总体而言，本框架将典型操作风险过程与随机控制相结合，可能为运营管理和操作风险管理领域开辟新的研究方向。资源链接: OperationalRiskManagement: Preventive vs. CorrectiveControl",

The perception of risk depends on the observer’s cognitive biases and world view which nuance risk related decisions. How an observer decides also depends on the metric used to quantify risk. While there is extensive literature on how people perceive risk, and on how to price risk in relation to the market, there is little on how to price risk according to how risks interact within the firm. The essay concludes with a suggestion (and includes relevant citations) for a way forward.现有的风险管理概念在实际应用中面临挑战。风险感知取决于观察者的认知偏差和世界观，这些因素微妙地影响着风险相关决策。观察者的决策方式还取决于量化风险所用的指标。尽管有大量文献探讨人们如何感知风险，以及如何根据市场对风险进行定价，但关于如何根据风险在企业内部的相互作用来定价的研究却很少。文章最后提出了前进方向的建议（并附有相关引文）。资源链接: Challenges in ApplyingRiskManagementConcepts in Practice",

We provide a structured and substantiated way of conceptualizing ERM that captures and organizes the already existing discourse. We propose that there are essentially three dimensions of ERM: governance, integration, and strategy. In a further refinement, we propose a categorization of six underlying incentives for ERM: to, (i) achieve risk oversight, (ii) provide structure to the risk management system, (iii) increase organizational risk awareness, (iv) manage portfolios of risk, (v) develop strategy, and (vi) improve strategic decision-making.企业风险管理项目正大规模且坚定地转向企业全面风险管理（ERM）系统，但现有文献仍缺乏对ERM激励因素/益处的清晰结构化描述。我们提出了一种结构化且可验证的ERM概念化方法，对现有论述进行了系统梳理。我们认为ERM本质上包含三个维度：治理、整合与战略。进一步细分后，我们提出六项基础激励因素分类：（一）实现风险监督；（二）构建风险管理体系框架；（三）提升组织风险意识；（四）管理风险组合；（五）制定战略；（六）优化战略决策。资源链接: Incentive Based Dimensions of EnterpriseRiskManagement",

        "content": "Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is AI that can reason across a wide range of domains. It has long been considered the “grand dream” or “holy grail” of AI. It also poses major issues of ethics, risk, and policy due to its potential to transform society: if AGI is built, it could either help solve the world’s problems or cause major catastrophe, possibly even human extinction. This paper presents the first-ever survey of active AGI R&amp;D projects in terms of ethics, risk, and policy. A thorough search identifies 45 projects of diverse sizes, nationalities, ethical goals, and other attributes. Most projects are either academic or corporate. The academic projects tend to express goals of advancing knowledge and are less likely to be active on AGI safety issues. The corporate projects tend to express goals of benefiting humanity and are more likely to be active on safety. Most projects are based in the US, and almost all are in either the US or a US ally, including all of the larger projects. This geographic concentration could simplify policymaking, though most projects publish open-source code, enabling contributions from anywhere in the world. These and other findings of the survey offer an empirical basis for the study of AGI R&amp;D and a guide for policy and other action.通用人工智能（AGI）是一种能在广泛领域进行推理的AI技术，长期以来被视为AI领域的”终极梦想”或”圣杯”。由于其变革社会的潜力，AGI也引发了伦理、风险和政策方面的重大议题：若成功研发，它既能助力解决全球性问题，也可能引发重大灾难甚至导致人类灭绝。本文首次针对活跃的AGI研发项目开展了伦理、风险及政策维度的调查研究。通过全面检索共识别出45个规模、国籍、伦理目标各异的项目，其中多数属于学术机构或企业。学术项目多以推动知识进步为目标，较少关注AGI安全性问题；企业项目则更强调造福人类，且更注重安全研发。大多数项目位于美国，几乎所有项目都集中在美国或其盟国境内（包括全部大型项目）。这种地域集中性可能简化政策制定流程，不过多数项目开源代码的特性允许全球各地参与贡献。这些调查结果为AGI研发研究提供了实证基础，也为政策制定等行动提供了指引依据。资源链接: A Survey of Artificial General Intelligence Projects for Ethics,Risk, and Policy",

        "content": "Impact evaluations of trade facilitation reforms have almost exclusively focused on reforms by data-rich customs agencies. Other “technical” agencies also intervene in the logistics of international trade, and do so in ways that can cause significant interruptions in the flow of the imported products they oversee. This paper is the first to evaluate a reform by a technical agency, namely, the agency responsible for food safety and animal health in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The data environment is much more challenging than in customs, but enables the investigation of novel questions. The study finds that on-the-ground practices regarding sampling of import shipments departed substantially from those planned in the reform. It finds little evidence that the reform was successful in its attempt to improve the targeting of risky shipments. There is limited evidence that the reform increased trade flows, but circumstances make it difficult to establish a strong causal link to the specific reform studied.对贸易便利化改革的成效评估几乎全部集中于数据充足的海关机构所实施的改革。其他“技术性”机构同样介入国际贸易物流环节，其干预方式可能导致其监管的进口产品流动出现严重中断。本文首次对一家技术性机构——即前南斯拉夫马其顿共和国负责食品安全与动物健康的机构——实施的改革进行评估。该领域的数据环境比海关更为复杂，但也为研究新问题提供了可能。研究发现，在实际操作中针对进口货物的抽样检测与改革设计的方案存在显著偏差。几乎没有证据表明该改革在提高高风险货物筛查准确性方面取得成功。有有限证据显示改革促进了贸易流量增长，但客观条件使得难以确立其与所研究的具体改革之间存在明确因果关系。资源链接: An Evaluation of Border Management Reforms in aTechnicalAgency",

        "content": "Integrated assessment is an analysis of a topic that integrates multiple lines of research. Integrated assessments are thus inherently interdisciplinary. They are generally oriented toward practical problems, often in the context of public policy, and frequently concern topics in science and technology. This paper presents a concept for and some initial work towards an integrated assessment of global catastrophic risk (GCR). Generally speaking, GCR is the risk of significant harm to global human civilization. More precise definitions are provided below. Some GCRs include nuclear war, climate change, and pandemic disease outbreaks. Integrated assessment of GCR puts all these risks into one study in order to address overarching questions about the risk and the opportunities to reduce it. The specific concept for integrated assessment presented here has been developed over several years by the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute (GCRI). GCRI is an independent, nonprofit think tank founded in 2011 by Seth Baum and Tony Barrett (i.e., the authors). The integrated assessment structures much of GCRI’s thinking and activity, and likewise offers a framework for general study and work on the GCR topic.综合评估是对某一主题整合多方研究线索的分析。因此，综合评估本质上是跨学科的。这类评估通常以实际问题为导向，常涉及公共政策领域，并频繁关注科技议题。本文提出了针对全球灾难性风险（GCR）进行综合评估的构想及初步研究。广义而言，GCR指对全球人类文明造成重大伤害的风险，下文将提供更精准的定义。此类风险包括核战争、气候变化和大规模流行病爆发等。GCR综合评估将这些风险纳入统一研究框架，以解决关于风险本质及减灾机遇的核心问题。本文阐述的综合评估具体构想由全球灾难性风险研究所（GCRI）历经数年研发而成。GCRI是由塞斯·鲍姆与托尼·巴雷特（即本文作者）于2011年创立的独立非营利智库。该综合评估体系构成了GCRI大部分思想与行动的基础，同时也为GCR主题的普遍研究与实践提供了框架。资源链接: Towards an Integrated Assessment of Global CatastrophicRisk",

        "content": "The most extreme risk are those that threaten the entirety of human civilization, known as global catastrophic risks. The very extreme nature of global catastrophes makes them both challenging to analyze and important to address. They are challenging to analyze because they are largely unprecedented and because they involve the entire global human system. They are important to address because they threaten everyone around the world and future generations. Global catastrophic risks also pose some deep dilemmas. One dilemma occurs when actions to reduce global catastrophic risk could harm society in other ways, as in the case of geoengineering to reduce catastrophic climate change risk. Another dilemma occurs when reducing one global catastrophic risk could increase another, as in the case of nuclear power reducing climate change risk while increasing risks from nuclear weapons. The complex, interrelated nature of global catastrophic risk suggests a research agenda in which the full space of risks are assessed in an integrated fashion in consideration of the deep dilemmas and other challenges they pose. Such an agenda can help identify the best ways to manage these most extreme risks and keep human civilization safe.最极端的风险是那些威胁整个人类文明的全球性灾难风险。全球性灾难的极端性质使得它们既难以分析又至关重要。难以分析是因为它们大多史无前例，且涉及全球人类系统；至关重要则在于它们威胁着全世界所有人及子孙后代。全球性灾难风险还带来若干深刻困境：其一是降低灾难风险的措施可能在其他方面损害社会，例如为缓解灾难性气候变化风险实施的地球工程；其二是降低某类全球灾难风险可能加剧另一类风险，比如核能虽能降低气候变化风险，却会增大核武器威胁。全球性灾难风险具有复杂互联的特性，这要求建立综合评估所有风险的研究框架，同时考量其引发的深层困境与其他挑战。此类研究有助于找到管理极端风险、守护人类文明的最佳途径。资源链接: Global Catastrophes: The Most Extreme Risks",

        "content": "This paper examines how services trade and policies contribute to connectivity. It highlights the economic relevance of services and identifies some key channels through which trade in services contributes to physical and digital connectivity. The paper examines the impact of services trade policies on connectivity in view of recent research showing their impact on sectoral performance, economic welfare and development. Finally, it discusses the positive contribution that aid for trade can make in support of services policies. The paper finds that services sectors play a multifaceted and significant role in connecting countries to the international trading system, and matter greatly to economic development and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Services significantly affect connectivity by: (i) providing the basic infrastructure to support trade in goods; (ii) facilitating supply chains and entering trade as value added embodied in goods; (iii) providing the backbone that enables e-commerce and the on-line supply of services; (iv) and enhancing export diversification through their cross-border electronic supply. The paper underscores that services trade policies have a fundamental impact on connectivity. Restrictions to investment and cross-border trade in services remain high and widespread. But an enabling policy environment – promoting competition, openness to trade and investment, and adequate regulatory frameworks – can enhance connectivity, lower trade costs, and foster growth and economic performance. For example, improving the policy environment for services sectors can help attract the FDI required to meet the SDGs and develop the ICT infrastructure needed to bridge the digital divide. Aid for Trade can play a supportive role in this regard.本文探讨了服务贸易及其政策如何促进互联互通。文章重点分析了服务的经济重要性，并指出了服务贸易促进实体与数字互联互通的若干关键渠道。基于近期研究表明服务贸易政策对行业表现、经济福利及发展具有重要影响，本文研究了这类政策对互联互通的作用。最后，文章讨论了贸易援助对服务政策的积极支持作用。研究发现：服务业在连接各国与国际贸易体系方面发挥着多层面重要作用，对经济发展和实现可持续发展目标（SDGs）至关重要。服务业通过以下方式显著影响互联互通：（一）提供支撑货物贸易的基础设施；（二）促进供应链发展并以商品内含增值形式参与贸易；（三）构建支持电子商务和在线服务供给的技术骨架；（四）通过跨境电子化供应推动出口多元化。研究强调，服务贸易政策对互联互通具有根本性影响。目前对服务业投资和跨境贸易的限制仍普遍存在且程度较高，但营造有利的政策环境——促进竞争、开放贸易投资、完善监管框架——能够增强互联互通、降低贸易成本并提振经济增长表现。例如，改善服务业政策环境有助于吸引实现SDGs所需的外国直接投资，并发展弥合数字鸿沟所需的信息通信技术基础设施。贸易援助可在此领域发挥重要支持作用。资源链接: The Contribution of ServicesTradePolicies to Connectivity in the Context of Aid forTrade",

        "content": "Nowadays, risk management is on everyone’s corporate agenda; let it be a private or public organisation. A special attention to risk management is paid by governments, stock exchanges, shareholders and regulators. However, this hasn’t always been the case. We began our risk management research back in 2007. This was the time when most large non-financial corporations were just starting to build risk management functions and implementing risk management frameworks. At the time, our study showed that risk management was largely driven by the stock exchange requirements and was very basic in nature. Today, as we continue to adapt to a highly volatile environment, businesses are becoming more proactive about risk management. Is this just a facade or are organisations truly becoming more risk aware? During our research, we were pleasantly surprised by how many companies have already recognized the limitations of “stand-alone” and “separate” risk management processes and are proactive in integrating risk management into decision-making, core business processes and the overall culture of the organisation. We have collated best practices from more than a dozen mature organisations to propose an alternative approach to risk management. An approach without the heat maps, risk registers, risk frameworks or risk mitigation plans. For several years, we have tested and validated the findings both locally and internationally. Based on our research and the interviews, we have summarized fifteen practical ideas on how to improve the integration of risk management into the daily life of the organisation. These were grouped into three high level objectives: drive risk culture, help integrate risk management into business and become a trusted adviser. This document is designed as a practical implementation guide. We recommend using it as such. Each section is accompanied by checklists, video references, useful links and templates.如今，风险管理已成为所有企业的核心议题，无论是私营还是公共机构。政府、证券交易所、股东和监管机构都对风险管理给予了特别关注。但情况并非一直如此。我们自2007年便开始了风险管理研究，彼时多数大型非金融企业才刚刚着手建立风险管理职能并实施管理框架。当时研究表明，风险管理主要由证券交易所要求驱动，本质仍非常基础。如今随着企业持续适应高度波动的环境，它们对风险管理的态度正变得更加主动。这究竟是表面功夫，还是组织真正提升了风险意识？研究过程中，我们惊喜地发现，许多企业已认识到”孤立”和”割裂”式风险管理流程的局限性，正积极将风险管理融入决策、核心业务流程和组织文化中。我们汇总了十余家成熟机构的最佳实践，提出了一种创新的风险管理方法——摒弃热力图、风险登记册、管理框架或缓解计划的方法论。通过多年本土与国际验证，基于研究和访谈，我们提炼出十五项将风险管理融入组织日常的实用建议，归纳为三大目标：推动风险文化、助力业务融合、成为可信顾问。本文件是实践指南，建议按需使用。每个章节均附检查清单、视频参考、实用链接和模板工具。资源链接: Guide to EffectiveRiskManagement3.0",

        "content": "Over the last 15 years, the global trade of virgin olive oil (VOO) seems to face a stringent regulatory regime, mainly through the imposition of TBT and SPS measures. Such a development should have adversely impacted global levels of VOO trade. However, evidence shows that the world’s imports of VOO have more than quadrupled in value since 2000. Alongside this trend, the share of VOO imports gradually shifts from traditional sources (mainly EU) to New World producing countries, such as Argentina, Australia, the USA, and Chile. By extracting data from hundreds of NTM regulations, as well as all possible registered bilateral trade flows between 2002 to 2014, this paper aims to empirically explore to what extent particular NTMs impact imports of VOO. The results indicate that while tariffs remain a stringent barrier, most NTMs have a positive impact on imports, rather than enhancing restrictiveness. The paper asserts that the majority of NTMs respond to consumers’ demand for higher food safety standards and protection of human health, while increasing available information and transparency. That, in turn, leads to an expansion in the magnitude of imports of VOO products.过去15年间，全球初榨橄榄油贸易似乎面临着严格的监管制度，主要是通过技术性贸易壁垒（TBT）和卫生与植物检疫（SPS）措施的实施。这种发展本应对初榨橄榄油的全球贸易水平产生负面影响。然而，有证据表明，自2000年以来，全球初榨橄榄油进口额已增长了三倍多。与此同时，初榨橄榄油进口来源逐渐从传统产地（主要是欧盟）转向新兴生产国，如阿根廷、澳大利亚、美国和智利。本文通过提取数百项非关税措施（NTM）法规数据以及2002至2014年间所有可能的双边贸易流量记录，旨在实证研究特定非关税措施对初榨橄榄油进口的影响程度。研究结果表明，尽管关税仍是严格壁垒，但大多数非关税措施对进口产生了积极影响，而非增强限制性。本文认为，多数非关税措施响应了消费者对更高食品安全标准和人类健康保护的需求，同时增加了信息透明度和可获得性，这反过来又促使初榨橄榄油产品的进口规模扩大。资源链接: TheTrade-Enhancing Effects of Non-TariffMeasureson Virgin Olive Oil",

        "content": "Alongside the global tariff liberalization, a growing body of evidence demonstrates the rise in the use of non-tariff measures (NTMs), which suggests a substitution effect between these two import policy instruments. Yet, detailed economic data reveals that in countries with lower tariff rates (developed countries), the use of NTMs is significantly lower compared to developing countries, which implies a possible complementary effect between tariffs and NTMs across nations. Using a dataset of Kee, Nicita and Olarreaga (2009) on ad valorem tariff equivalents of NTMs, at a very disaggregated product level, this paper explores the determinants of NTMs and their substitutability/complementarity relations with tariff barriers. While exploiting the country variation, it demonstrates the decreasing trend of substitutability between the two import policy instruments with the rise in economic development. In particular, a significant complementarity correlation exists between the two trade measures among the wealthiest nations, implying a stronger commitment to freer trade.在全球关税自由化的同时，越来越多的证据表明非关税措施（NTMs）的使用有所增加，这表明这两种进口政策工具之间存在替代效应。然而，详细的经济数据揭示，在关税税率较低的国家（发达国家），非关税措施的使用明显少于发展中国家，这意味着各国之间关税与非关税措施可能存在互补效应。本文利用Kee、Nicita和Olarreaga（2009）关于非关税措施从价税等值的数据集，在非常细分的产品层面上，探讨了非关税措施的决定因素及其与关税壁垒的替代/互补关系。通过利用国家间的差异，研究表明随着经济发展水平的提高，这两种进口政策工具之间的替代性呈下降趋势。特别是在最富裕的国家中，这两种贸易措施之间存在显著的互补相关性，意味着对更自由贸易的更强承诺。资源链接: Tariffs and Non-TariffMeasures: Substitutes or Complements.

        "content": "In recent years, the imposition of Non-Tariff Measures (NTMs) has increased rapidly both in quantity and importance. This development, with its considerable economic impact, particularly within the area of global trade, has prompted numerous scholars to explore the direction and magnitude of the trade effects of NTMs. Moreover, increased efforts are being placed on further exploring the determinants behind the use of NTMs, as well as their policy implications. The current paper aims to survey the empirical trade literature, in order to uncover the available responses to major questions regarding the trade effects of NTMs, principally of TBT and SPS measures. Among the questions posed are: (1) How do specific types of NTMs affect imports and exports? (2) Are developing countries more sensitive to NTMs? (3) Are small-medium sized firms more adversely affected by NTMs? (4) How are particular sectors/products affected by NTMs? And, (5) Do Harmonization and Mutual Recognition necessarily impact trade positively?近年来，非关税措施（NTMs）在数量和重要性上都迅速增加。这一发展对全球经济，尤其是全球贸易领域产生了重大影响，促使众多学者探究非关税措施对贸易影响的方向和程度。此外，学界正加大力度深入研究非关税措施使用背后的决定因素及其政策含义。本文旨在梳理实证贸易文献，以揭示关于非关税措施（主要是技术性贸易壁垒和卫生与植物检疫措施）贸易效应的核心问题的现有答案。提出的问题包括：（1）特定类型的非关税措施如何影响进出口？（2）发展中国家是否对非关税措施更敏感？（3）中小企业是否更易受到非关税措施的负面影响？（4）特定行业/产品如何受非关税措施影响？（5）协调与互认是否必然对贸易产生积极影响？资源链接: Quantifying theTradeEffects of NTMs: A Review of the Empirical Literature",

        "content": "Trade in health products has been flourishing in recent years as the demand for better health has been growing throughout the world. At the same time, trade in health products is hampered by substantive trade barriers. In this paper, we present evidence that countries around the world still apply tariffs and nontariff measures that increase prices and limit the availability of health-related products such as pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and medical equipment. The case for liberalizing trade in these products is therefore strong. In addition, we show that improving trade facilitation performance, using the World Trade Organization’s Trade Facilitation Agreement as a starting point, can be linked to improved handling of health-related products such as vaccines which, in turn, would boost usage. In the last part of the paper, we study the price differences for insulin across countries. We observe that the price of insulin has various determinants, one of them being open trade: the higher the level of competition between manufacturers, the lower the price of insulin. In summary, lowering trade barriers on health products can make a substantive contribution to building up health systems and lowering out-of-pocket payments of patients.近年来，随着全球对健康需求的不断增长，健康产品的贸易蓬勃发展。与此同时，健康产品贸易也受到实质性贸易壁垒的阻碍。本文提供的证据表明，世界各国仍在实施关税和非关税措施，这些措施提高了药品、疫苗和医疗设备等健康相关产品的价格并限制了其可获得性。因此，放开这些产品的贸易具有充分理由。此外，我们还表明，以世界贸易组织的《贸易便利化协定》为起点，提高贸易便利化绩效可以与改善疫苗等健康相关产品的处理相关联，从而促进其使用。在本文的最后部分，我们研究了各国胰岛素的价格差异。我们观察到，胰岛素的价格有多种决定因素，其中之一是开放的贸易：制造商之间的竞争越激烈，胰岛素的价格就越低。总之，降低健康产品的贸易壁垒可以为建立卫生系统和降低患者自付费用做出实质性贡献。资源链接: Tradein Health Products: ReducingTradeBarriers for Better Health",

        "content": "Trade costs such as applied tariffs, transportation and insurance costs are amplified as they pass through the multiple production steps associated with modern supply chains. This so called “cascade effect” arises since trade costs accumulate as intermediate goods are imported and then re-exported further downstream, going through different processing nodes before reaching the final consumer. Moreover, the financial impact of these trade costs is magnified in the “trade in tasks” rationale which governs global value chains (GVCs). Specialised processing firms need to recoup the associated trade cost applying to the full value of the good from the smaller fraction of value-added created at each consecutive productive stage. This large relative weight of transaction expenses on the profitability of individual business operations explains why trade along GVCs is particularly exposed to trade costs. The paper reviews the implications of trade costs on competitiveness at industry, national and global levels. The financial implications of trade costs at firm and sectoral level are based on trade in value-added data for 2011. The multilateral welfare effects of reducing discrete trade costs are identified using a network analysis approach, which goes beyond the traditional bilateral dimension of international trade and identifies where trade facilitation investment would have the highest social returns from a GVC perspective. The authors conclude that while the direct benefits of trade facilitation will be proportionally higher for those countries that are not well integrated into international trade because of their high trade costs, the global benefits of trade facilitation investments will also be high if they are undertaken by key traders that lie at the core of global value chains.诸如适用关税、运输和保险费用等贸易成本，在通过现代供应链的多个生产环节时会不断放大。这种所谓的“级联效应”之所以产生，是因为中间产品在进口后又被下游再次出口，经过不同加工节点最终到达终端消费者时，贸易成本会不断累积。此外，在支配全球价值链（GVCs）的“任务贸易”逻辑中，这些贸易成本的财务影响被进一步放大。专业化加工企业需要从每个连续生产阶段创造的较小增值部分中，收回适用于商品全部价值的相应贸易成本。交易费用对个体企业经营利润的这种巨大相对影响，解释了为何沿全球价值链进行的贸易尤其容易受到贸易成本的冲击。本文审视了贸易成本对行业、国家及全球层面竞争力的影响。基于2011年贸易增加值数据，研究量化了企业和行业层面贸易成本的财务影响。通过采用网络分析方法——该方法突破了传统国际贸易的双边维度，从全球价值链视角识别出贸易便利化投资能产生最高社会回报的节点——研究明确了降低离散型贸易成本带来的多边福利效应。作者得出结论：虽然贸易便利化的直接收益会因高贸易成本而与国际贸易融合度较低的国家成比例更高，但若处于全球价值链核心地位的关键贸易国实施便利化措施，其投资带来的全球收益同样将极为显著。资源链接: AccumulatingTradeCosts and Competitiveness in Global Value Chains",

Insurance frauds are driving up the overall costs of insurers and premiums for policyholders. It encompasses a wide range of illicit practices and illegal acts. Insurance companies have witnessed increase in the number of fraud cases since couple of years. Risk Management has been acquiring monumental importance in insurance industry. Insurance business is of dynamic nature that puts an additional onus on risk management. So insurance companies need comprehensive risk management strategies that involve fraud risk assessment and fraud prevention. The purpose of this study is to analyze various types of life insurance frauds, assess the risks associated with these frauds and finally frame an ideal risk management strategy to curtail or minimize the frauds associated with life insurance.

From a trade policy perspective, the main immediate concern is to ensure that international trade rules and disciplines do not unduly affect countries’ ability to manage their water resources sustainably and according to their respective social preferences. While the local nature of water systems and the diversity of water management objectives is not conducive to the application of trade instruments to enforce a prescriptive, one-size-fits-all approach to water management, there is also a range of areas in which trade policy could support the sustainable management of water and related SDG objectives.本文探讨了贸易政策与水资源管理在农业、水力发电、供水服务及废水处理等领域的若干关键交叉点。从贸易政策视角出发，当前首要关注点是确保国际贸易规则和纪律不会过度制约各国根据自身社会偏好可持续管理水资源的能力。尽管水系统的地域特性及水资源管理目标的多样性不适宜采用贸易工具来推行一刀切式的指令性管理方法，但贸易政策仍可在诸多领域支持水资源可持续管理及相关可持续发展目标的实现。资源链接: Tradeand Water: How MightTradePolicy Contribute to Sustainable Water Management?",

However their impact will vary, with some exporters being able to refocus on TBT-free markets. By matching a database of TBT measures raised as concerns at the WTO (Specific Trade Concerns - STCs), with a firm-level panel of French exporters, we show the complex effects of restrictive TBT measures on the different margins of trade. We show that the negative effect of TBT on export participation is magnified for multi-destination firms, which can divert their exports towards TBT-free destinations. Moreover, we conduct aggregate level estimations to show that the effect of stringent TBTs in reducing export ows is magnified in more homogeneous sectors. Observing the shape of the firm distribution at sectoral level and the aggregate elasticity of export to trade cost, we shed light on the fixed component of the additional cost imposed by TBTs on exporters.严格的贸易技术壁垒（TBT）预计将迫使出口商退出设置这些障碍的市场。但其影响会有所不同，部分出口商可将重心转向无TBT限制的市场。通过将世界贸易组织（WTO）记录的引发关切的TBT措施数据库（特定贸易关注-STCs）与法国出口商企业层面面板数据相匹配，我们揭示了限制性TBT措施对贸易不同层面的复杂影响。研究发现，TBT对出口参与的负面影响在多目的地企业中更为显著，这些企业可将出口转向无TBT限制的目的地。此外，我们通过宏观层面估算表明，在行业同质性更高的领域，严格TBT对出口流量的抑制效应会进一步放大。通过观察行业层面的企业分布形态以及出口对贸易成本的总体弹性，我们揭示了TBT给出口商带来的额外成本中固定成本部分的特征。资源链接: Let’s Try Next Door:TechnicalBarriers toTradeand Multi-Destination Firms",

        "content": "The Basel Committee plans to revise the Standardised Approach (SA) to bank capital for credit risk and to employ the revised SA as a floor for bank capital based on internal models. The changes are likely to have a major impact on the overall level of capital and its distribution across banks and asset classes. This paper examines the effects of the proposed changes in capital rules on the Swiss loan market. Using primarily public information, we estimate the effects on the capital of individual Swiss banks broken down by asset class. We infer what this is likely to imply for lending rates in the Swiss market. We find that the proposed rule changes would substantially boost capital overall, affecting most severely capital for Corporate and Specialised Lending exposures. Under the BCBS 347 proposals, total bank capital would rise 39% while capital for Corporate and Specialised Lending exposures would increase by 142% and 130%, respectively. This allocation of capital across asset classes is inconsistent with the lessons of the recent financial crisis which was triggered by the collapse of the US residential mortgage market and involved relatively little impact on the quality of corporate credit. By our calculations, bank spreads for corporate loans would rise by between 63 and 103 basis points.巴塞尔委员会计划修订银行信用风险资本的标准法（SA），并将修订后的SA作为基于内部模型的银行资本底线。这些变动可能对资本总体水平及其在银行和资产类别间的分布产生重大影响。本文研究了拟议资本规则变动对瑞士贷款市场的影响。我们主要利用公开信息，估算了其对瑞士各银行按资产类别划分的资本影响，并推断这将对瑞士市场的贷款利率产生何种影响。研究发现，拟议规则变动将大幅提升整体资本水平，其中企业和专业贷款敞口的资本受影响最为严重。根据BCBS 347提案，银行总资本将增加39%，而企业和专业贷款敞口的资本将分别上升142%和130%。这种跨资产类别的资本分配与近期金融危机的教训相矛盾——该危机由美国住宅抵押贷款市场崩溃引发，对企业信贷质量影响相对较小。据我们测算，企业贷款的银行利差将上升63至103个基点。资源链接: Capital Floors, the Revised SA and the Cost of Loans in Switzerland",

        "content": "Internal audit functions (IAFs) of organisations are regarded as crucial components of the combined assurance model, alongside the audit committee, management and external auditors. The combined assurance model aims at having integrated and aligned assurance in organisations with the overall aim of maximising risk and governance oversight and control efficiencies. In this regard, internal audit plays a crucial role, insofar as it consists of experts in risk, governance and control consultancy who provide assurance to senior management and the audit committee. Audit committees are dependent on internal audit for information and their effectiveness revolves around a strong and well-resourced internal audit function which is able to aid audit committees to meet their oversight responsibilities. There is thus a growing demand for managing risk through the process of risk management and internal audit is in a perfect position to assist with the improvement of such processes. If internal auditors wish to continue being an important aspect of the combined assurance model, they need to address the critical area, amongst others, of risk management as part of their work. If not, it follows that the board, audit committees and other levels of management will remain uninformed on the status of these matters which, in turn, will negatively impact the ability of these stakeholders to discharge their responsibilities. This study therefore focuses on analysing the functioning of IAFs, with specific reference to their risk management mandate. The study followed a mixed method approach to describe internal audits risk management functioning in the big eight metropolitan municipalities in South Africa. The results show that internal audit provide a broad scope of risk management work which assist senior management in the discharge of their responsibilities. However, in the public eye, internal audits risk management functioning is scant.组织的内部审计职能（IAFs）被视为联合保证模式中的关键组成部分，与审计委员会、管理层及外部审计机构并列。联合保证模式旨在通过整合与协调各方的保证工作，最大化组织的风险与治理监督及控制效率。在此框架下，内部审计发挥着核心作用——其由风险、治理及控制咨询领域的专家组成，为高级管理层和审计委员会提供保证服务。审计委员会依赖内部审计获取信息，其效能的发挥离不开一个资源充足、能力强劲的内部审计职能，后者能协助审计委员会履行监督职责。因此，通过风险管理流程管控风险的需求日益增长，而内部审计恰好能协助优化此类流程。若内部审计师希望持续成为联合保证模式的重要支柱，就必须将风险管理等关键领域纳入工作范畴。否则，董事会、审计委员会及其他管理层级将无法掌握这些事项的动态，进而削弱相关方履行职责的能力。本研究着重分析内部审计职能的运行机制，尤其关注其风险管理职责。研究采用混合方法，描述了南非八大都市市政当局内部审计的风险管理运作情况。结果显示，内部审计提供了广泛的风险管理工作，有效支持高级管理层履职。然而在公众视野中，内部审计的风险管理职能仍显不足。资源链接: Internal AuditRiskManagement in Metropolitan Municipalities",

In the absence of adequate safety mechanisms, an ASI may even be likely to cause human extinction. Thus ASI risk scenarios merit attention even if their probabilities are low. ASI risk can be addressed in at least two ways: by building safety mechanisms into the ASI itself, as in ASI safety research, and by managing the human process of developing ASI, in order to promote safety practices in ASI research and development (R&amp;D). While ASI researchers and developers typically do not intend to cause harm through their work, harm may nonetheless occur due to accidents and unintended consequences. Thus opportunities may exist to reduce ASI risk through engagement with the R&amp;D process. This paper surveys established methodologies for risk analysis and risk management, emphasizing fault trees and event trees, and describes how these techniques can be applied to risk from ASI R&amp;D. A variety of risk methodologies have been developed for other risks, including other emerging technology risks, but their application to ASI has thus far been limited. Insights from risk literatures could improve on what existing analyses of ASI risk have yet been conducted. Likewise, a more thorough and rigorous analysis of ASI R&amp;D processes can inform decision making to reduce the risk. The decision makers include governments and non-governmental organizations active in ASI oversight, as well anyone conducting ASI R&amp;D. All of these individuals and groups have roles to play in addressing ASI risk.人工超级智能（ASI）日益被视为未来的一项重大风险。在缺乏足够安全机制的情况下，ASI甚至可能导致人类灭绝。因此即便发生概率较低，ASI风险情景仍值得关注。应对ASI风险至少存在两种途径：一是在ASI内部构建安全机制（如ASI安全研究领域所做的那样），二是通过管理人类开发ASI的进程来促进其研发过程中的安全实践。尽管ASI研究者与开发者通常无意通过其工作造成伤害，但事故和意外后果仍可能导致危害发生。因此通过介入研发流程来降低ASI风险存在可行性。本文梳理了风险分析与风险管理的成熟方法论（重点包括故障树与事件树），并阐述如何将这些技术应用于ASI研发风险。针对其他风险（包括其他新兴技术风险）已发展出多种风险分析方法，但迄今在ASI领域的应用仍有限。来自风险研究文献的洞见可改进现有ASI风险分析的不足。同样，对ASI研发流程进行更全面严谨的分析，能为降低风险的决策提供依据。这些决策者包括积极参与ASI监管的政府与非政府组织，以及所有从事ASI研发的实体。所有这些个体与群体在应对ASI风险中都扮演着重要角色。资源链接: RiskAnalysis andRiskManagementfor the Artificial Superintelligence Research and Development Process",

The proposed risk management framework identifies 3 levels for bridging the gaps in industry frameworks of prudent risk management and information assurance. Context-sensitive adaptation can be enabled by integration across vulnerability analysis and penetration testing embedded within overall systems and networks controls framework and risk management frameworks. Given the discussed contexts of risk management, controls, and compliance frameworks, compliance can benefit from adapting the proposed framework to institution’s specific needs. Integration across the 3 levels of vulnerability analysis and penetration testing embedded within overall systems and networks controls and overarching risk management frameworks can facilitate such context-sensitive adaptation. From perspective of the ISACA framework, vulnerability assessment and penetration testing can be embedded within IT audit framework of assessment of adequacy of internal controls for effective risk management and compliance.

        "content": "The World Trade Organization’s (WTO) most recent Ministerial Conference took place last December in Nairobi, Kenya. Opinions vary on how much was achieved, and, perhaps more importantly, where the WTO goes from here. The United States and the European Union have emphasized that “new” issues and approaches should guide WTO negotiations in the future. But it is not clear what that means, and how it relates to the “old” issues and approaches. And with the rise of mega-regional trade negotiations, such as the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), there are serious questions about the WTO’s role as a negotiating forum for trade liberalization. This paper reviews the current WTO negotiating agenda and the Nairobi outcomes, discusses possibilities for new directions, and makes suggestions for the WTO going forward.世界贸易组织（WTO）最近一次部长级会议于去年12月在肯尼亚内罗毕举行。各方对会议取得的成果众说纷纭，而更关键的问题或许在于WTO今后的发展方向。美国和欧盟强调，”新”议题和新方法应指导WTO未来的谈判。但这具体意味着什么，与”旧”议题和方法有何关联，目前尚不明确。随着跨太平洋伙伴关系协定（TPP）和跨大西洋贸易与投资伙伴关系协定（TTIP）等大型区域贸易谈判的兴起，WTO作为贸易自由化谈判论坛的角色也面临严峻质疑。本文审视了WTO当前的谈判议程和内罗毕会议成果，探讨了未来发展方向的可能性，并为WTO的前进道路提出建议。资源链接: Is the Doha Round Over?

        "content": "As tariff barriers, of traditional and typical policy instruments in international trade, have been reduced significantly under preferential trade agreements as well as the multilateral trading system, non-tariff measures (NTMs), especially those of technical barriers to trade (TBT), become more and more important as means to control international trade. This study is to analyze and better understand TBT or more accurately, technical measures. Based on the analysis, it will attempt to identify some implications and ways to reduce TBT or to facilitate international trade, and ultimately contribute to enhancing economic integration in the Asia-Pacific region. The characteristics and trends of technical measures can be best identified and evaluated by the notifications of WTO members according to the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement), discussions in the WTO TBT Committee - especially specific trade concerns (STCs), and dispute settlement cases in TBT related issues. In fact, the number of TBT notifications have surged as various and comprehensive legitimate objectives of technical regulations were allowed and on other backgrounds since the launch of the WTO in 1995. It is noted, however, that TBT notifications are not regarded as TBT itself but as “potential” TBTs in this study. To analyze the trends and characteristics of TBT measures, this study utilizes the information in the WTO TBT notifications, STCs, and dispute settlement cases related to the TBT Agreement. Focus will be on the APEC member economies. Some trends and characteristics of TBT measures by the objective of regulation, by commodity, and by the country notified (e.g., developed and developing economies) will be analyzed and identified. Some of implications from the results are as follows. Due to the fact that technical measures are mostly domestic regulations but controlled at the border to restrict market access, there needs to be consultation, cooperation and harmonization of regulation rather than competition and retaliation. There also needs to be developed a system for information and experience exchange, capacity building including on development and implementation of standards, technical regulation, and conformity assessment procedures, especially for developing economies. APEC is well positioned to lead international cooperation in TBT with its diverse members and related specific institutions.随着关税壁垒这一国际贸易中传统且典型的政策工具在优惠贸易协定和多边贸易体系下大幅削减，非关税措施（NTMs），尤其是技术性贸易壁垒（TBT），作为调控国际贸易的手段日益重要。本研究旨在分析和更深入理解技术性贸易壁垒，或更准确地说，技术性措施。基于分析，本研究将尝试提出减少技术性贸易壁垒或促进国际贸易的启示与途径，最终为加强亚太地区经济一体化作出贡献。通过世贸组织成员根据《技术性贸易壁垒协定》（TBT协定）提交的通报、世贸组织TBT委员会讨论——特别是特定贸易关注（STCs），以及与TBT相关问题争端解决案例，最能识别和评估技术性措施的特征与趋势。事实上，自1995年世贸组织成立以来，由于技术法规多样且全面的合法目标被允许以及其他背景因素，TBT通报数量激增。但需注意的是，本研究中TBT通报不被视为技术性贸易壁垒本身，而是”潜在”技术性贸易壁垒。为分析技术性贸易壁垒措施的趋势与特征，本研究利用世贸组织TBT通报、特定贸易关注及与TBT协定相关争端解决案例中的信息。研究将聚焦亚太经合组织成员经济体，从法规目标、商品类别和通报国家（如发达经济体与发展中经济体）等维度分析识别技术性贸易壁垒措施的若干趋势与特征。研究结果的部分启示如下：鉴于技术性措施多为国内法规却在边境实施以限制市场准入，需要开展法规协商、合作与协调而非竞争报复；还需建立信息经验交流体系，加强标准制定与实施、技术法规和合格评定程序等方面的能力建设，特别是对发展中经济体而言。凭借其多元化成员和相关专门机构，亚太经合组织完全有能力引领技术性贸易壁垒领域的国际合作。资源链接: WTO Discussions onTechnicalBarriers toTradeand Implications for Asia-Pacific Regional Economic Integration",

        "content": "This article empirically investigates the impact of trade barriers on the world wine trade, focusing on trade costs impeding exports, including transport, tariffs, technical barriers and sanitary and phytosanitarystandards. A gravity model is estimated using data from the main importing and exporting countries for the years 1997 to 2010. The Poison Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimator accounts for heteroskedasticity and the presence of zero trade flows. Our results identify which regulations can adversely affect trade, providing useful information to policy-makers involved in negotiations on trade frictions. While sanitary and phytosanitary measures do not seem to obstruct exports, technical barriers have a varying impact on trade. A decreasing trend for tariffs has largely been compensated by more stringent technical barriers. The overall result is that frictions in the world wine trade have not changed during the past fifteen years.本文实证研究了贸易壁垒对全球葡萄酒贸易的影响，重点考察阻碍出口的贸易成本，包括运输、关税、技术壁垒及卫生与植物检疫标准。研究采用1997至2010年间主要进出口国家的数据，通过引力模型进行估算，并运用泊松伪最大似然（PPML）估计量解决异方差性和零贸易流问题。研究结果明确了哪些法规可能对贸易产生不利影响，为参与贸易摩擦谈判的决策者提供了实用信息。研究发现，卫生与植物检疫措施似乎并未阻碍出口，而技术壁垒对贸易的影响则存在差异。关税下降的趋势在很大程度上被更严格的技术壁垒所抵消。总体结果表明，过去十五年间全球葡萄酒贸易的摩擦程度并未发生变化。资源链接: Tariffs and Non-Tariff Frictions in the World WineTrade",

        "content": "The 2016 invited research presentation at the Princeton Quant Trading Conference proposes two new financial innovations and their interrelationships: ‘Model Risk Arbitrage’ for ‘Open Systems Finance’. It develops the new framework of Model Risk Arbitrage for profit-maximization in the emerging global financial markets characterized by unprecedented uncertainty, complexity, and, rapid discontinuous changes. It develops the new framework of ‘Open Systems Finance’ aligned with George Soros’ Reflexivity Theory based upon empirical practical experience in financial markets as contrasted from ‘Closed Systems Finance’ models characterizing most of classical and academic Finance and Economics theory. Aligning with George Soros’ Reflexivity Theory and associated Hegelian Dialectic, it characterizes ‘reflexivity’ as the missing link in Finance theory, research, and, practice that can help understand the effect of feedback and feedforward loops across Time and Space in information-based non-deterministic ‘open systems’ Finance. Consistently, it is based on the Hegelian Dialectic characterizing the [profit-maximizing] Black Hat approach as compared with the [risk-optimizing] White Hat approach. The Black Hat approach exploits all vulnerabilities at all levels of all systems to maximize advantage over the White Hat approach. Similarly, Model Risk Arbitrage exploits all model risks at all levels of all systems to maximize advantage over Model Risk Management. Open Systems Finance framework advances beyond ‘silo’ based mindsets characterizing academic theory and practices and thus serves as foundation for developing and executing Model Risk Arbitrage strategies for profit-maximization. The current presentation advances upon last two decades of our applied and industrial research and global practices on post-WWW era management and modeling frameworks of uncertainty and risk management. It builds upon our research and practices on designing self-adaptive complex systems for high velocity hyper-turbulent environments characterized by high uncertainty.  The 2016 invited presentation is the sequel to the 2015 invited presentation at the Princeton Quant Trading Conference which advanced Frank Knight’s (1921) original treatise developing the foundation of Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit for the Cyber Era.  The 2015 presentation laid the foundation for examining modeling and management of ‘true uncertainty’ which is distinct from [theoretical] risk and “which forms the basis of a valid theory of profit and accounts for the divergence between actual and theoretical competition” (Knight 1921). That presentation further advanced upon prior research in collaboration with world’s distinguished cybersecurity experts affiliated with the Air Force Research Lab and Wall Street’s leading risk management experts from top investment banks such as JP Morgan. That work developed the original basis for understanding emerging Cyber Finance practices at the intersection of leading-edge developments in both Finance and Cybersecurity related risk and uncertainty management. In addition, it also developed robust computational quantitative finance modeling foundations for industrywide Cyber Risk Insurance Modeling practices.2016年普林斯顿量化交易会议特邀研究报告提出了两项金融创新及其相互关系：面向”开放系统金融”的”模型风险套利”。该研究构建了”模型风险套利”新框架，旨在以前所未有的不确定性、复杂性和快速不连续变化为特征的新兴全球金融市场中实现利润最大化。研究同时发展了与乔治·索罗斯反身性理论相契合的”开放系统金融”新框架，该框架基于金融市场实证经验，有别于表征传统学院派金融经济理论的”封闭系统金融”模型。研究将”反身性”定位为金融理论、研究与实践领域缺失的关键环节，结合黑格尔辩证法与索罗斯反身性理论，阐释了这种基于信息的非确定性”开放系统”金融中跨越时空的反馈与前馈循环效应。研究采用黑格尔辩证法，将利润最大化的”黑帽策略”与风险优化的”白帽策略”进行对比——黑帽策略通过利用各系统层面的所有漏洞来最大化对白帽策略的优势，同理，模型风险套利通过利用各系统层面的所有模型风险来最大化对模型风险管理的优势。开放系统金融框架突破了学术理论与实践中常见的”孤岛思维”，为开发与执行利润最大化的模型风险套利策略奠定基础。本次报告基于我们过去二十年在后互联网时代管理与风险建模框架的应用研究及全球实践，延续了针对高不确定性超湍流环境设计自适应复杂系统的研究成果。作为2015年普林斯顿量化交易会议特邀报告的续篇，本次报告进一步发展了弗兰克·奈特(1921)关于网络时代风险、不确定性与利润基础的开创性论述。2015年报告为区分于(理论)风险的”真实不确定性”建模与管理研究奠定基础——奈特指出这种不确定性”构成了利润有效理论的基础，并解释了实际竞争与理论竞争的差异”。该研究曾与美国空军研究实验室顶尖网络安全专家及摩根大通等顶级投行风险管理专家合作，为理解金融与网络安全交叉领域的前沿风险管理实践建立了理论基础，同时为行业级网络风险保险建模实践奠定了稳健的计算量化金融建模基础。资源链接: Beyond ModelRiskManagementto ModelRiskArbitrage for FinTech Era: How to Navigate ‘Uncertainty’…When ‘Models’ Are ‘Wrong’…And Knowledge’…‘Imperfect’!

        "content": "We undertake a trade-growth accounting exercise by decomposing data on changes in bilateral international trade flows into their direct (endowment accumulation, productivity growth, changes in trade costs, changing preferences) and indirect components (general equilibrium effects). Furthermore, we distinguish between the (potentially partly endogenous) direct and the deep drivers of trade by extending standard new trade models to include endogenous factor accumulation, R&amp;D driven productivity growth, and endogenous changes in expenditures shares on manufacturing goods and services. We quantify the importance of the direct and deep drivers of the growth of bilateral and multilateral trade of 67 economies over 20 consecutive years since 1988 for three trade outcomes: changes in growth rates across different country pairs, changes in levels of trade flows, and changes in trade to GDP ratio. The results suggest that changes in shocks to endogenous endowment accumulation and trade costs have been the most important drivers of trade in the sample at hand, whereas productivity growth and changes in preferences appear to have been quantitatively less important.我们通过将双边国际贸易流量变化的数据分解为直接（要素禀赋积累、生产率增长、贸易成本变化、偏好变动）和间接成分（一般均衡效应），开展了一项贸易增长核算分析。此外，我们通过扩展标准新贸易模型，纳入内生要素积累、研发驱动的生产率增长以及制造业产品与服务支出份额的内生变化，区分了（可能部分内生的）直接驱动因素与深层贸易驱动因素。我们量化了1988年以来连续20年间67个经济体双边及多边贸易增长中直接与深层驱动因素对三类贸易结果的重要性：不同国家间增长率差异的变化、贸易流量水平的变化以及贸易占GDP比率的变化。结果表明，在现有样本中，内生禀赋积累冲击与贸易成本的变化始终是贸易最重要的驱动因素，而生产率增长与偏好变化的量化影响相对较小。资源链接: World-TradeGrowth Accounting",

        "content": "Despite the widespread tariff reductions sparked by the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement, borders in the region remain thick, with many hurdles standing in the way of regional trade. Although anecdotal evidence suggests that nontariff measures raise trade costs and inhibit trade in the region, little is known about the magnitude of these economic effects. This paper uses a newly collected data set to quantify the incidence of sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical barriers to trade in the region and benchmarks it with other parts of the world. The results indicate that the Central American region has the lowest prevalence of technical nontariff measures in the world. However, there is significant heterogeneity of trade-related regulations in Central America; for instance, 48 percent of Salvadoran imports are subject to at least one nontariff measure, compared with just 16 percent of Honduran imports. The paper estimates the impact of these technical measures on border prices and finds that the price impact of sanitary and phytosanitary measures is equivalent to an ad-valorem tariff of 11.6 percent. This price-rising effect is further investigated by looking in detail at the impact of sanitary and phytosanitary measures on the prices of beef, chicken meat, bread, and dairy products in Guatemala. The impact is estimated to be equivalent to an ad-valorem tariff of 68.4 percent, 51.4 percent, 22.0 percent, and 5.0 percent, respectively. The paper shows that efforts to streamline key sanitary and phytosanitary measures affecting these products by, for example, reducing the cost and time required to obtain sanitary registries, would likely reduce the Guatemalan urban extreme poverty rate from 5.07 percent to 4.91 percent.尽管《多米尼加共和国-中美洲自由贸易协定》引发了普遍的关税削减，但该地区的边界壁垒依然森严，区域贸易仍面临诸多障碍。虽有零星证据表明非关税措施推高了贸易成本并抑制区域贸易，但这些经济影响的具体程度尚不明确。本文通过新收集的数据集量化了该地区卫生与植物检疫措施及技术性贸易壁垒的发生率，并与全球其他地区进行对比。研究显示，中美洲地区技术性非关税措施的使用率为全球最低。然而中美洲各国贸易相关法规存在显著差异：例如萨尔瓦多48%的进口商品受至少一项非关税措施限制，而洪都拉斯这一比例仅为16%。本文估算了这些技术性措施对边境价格的影响，发现卫生与植物检疫措施的价格效应相当于11.6%的从价关税。通过具体分析卫生与植物检疫措施对危地马拉牛肉、鸡肉、面包和乳制品价格的影响，该研究进一步揭示了这种抬价效应——其等效从价关税分别达到68.4%、51.4%、22.0%和5.0%。研究表明，若通过降低卫生注册成本和时间等方式简化影响这些产品的关键卫生与植物检疫措施，危地马拉城市极端贫困率有望从5.07%降至4.91%。资源链接: TechnicalMeasurestoTradein Central America: Incidence, Price Effects, and Consumer Welfare",

ERM should theoretically reduce the volatility of cash flows, agency risk and information risk – ultimately reducing a firm’s default risk. We empirically investigate the relationship between the degree of ERM implementation and default risk in a panel dataset covering 78 of the world’s largest banks. We create a novel measure of the degree of ERM implementation. We find that a higher degree of ERM implementation is negatively related to the credit default swap spread (CDS) of a bank. When a rich set of control variables and fixed effects are included, a one standard deviation increase in the degree of ERM implementation decreases CDS spreads by 21 basis points. The degree of ERM implementation is however not a significant determinant of credit ratings when controls for corporate governance are included.企业风险管理（ERM）已成为一个更全面、更综合的风险管理框架，强调对风险管理体系的强化治理。理论上，ERM应能降低现金流的波动性、代理风险和信息风险，最终减少企业的违约风险。我们基于涵盖全球78家大型银行的面板数据，实证研究了ERM实施程度与违约风险之间的关系。我们创新性地构建了衡量ERM实施程度的指标，发现较高的ERM实施程度与银行的信用违约互换利差（CDS）呈负相关。在纳入大量控制变量和固定效应后，ERM实施程度每提高一个标准差，CDS利差会下降21个基点。但当加入公司治理控制变量时，ERM实施程度对信用评级的影响并不显著。资源链接: EnterpriseRiskManagementand DefaultRisk: Evidence from the Banking Industry",

        "content": "Using data on a broad international sample of listed, private, and non-profit entities, we explore the influence of risk management value creation objectives on the incorporation of risk considerations in planning and control systems. The combination of detailed survey responses and archival data allow us to provide evidence on the adoption of a wide variety of risk-focused planning and control practices, to examine how these practices vary with risk management objectives, and to shed light on the performance implications of risk-focused planning and control practices and risk management objectives. Our results highlight the important influence that risk management value creation objectives can have on the use and benefits from risk-focused planning and control practices. Organizations that primarily focus on minimizing risks within budget or reducing the total cost of risks tend to make less use of these practices, have higher stock price volatility, and achieve lower firm value than those that have taken greater steps to holistically consider both the upsides and downsides of risk.基于对上市企业、私营机构及非营利组织的广泛国际样本数据，我们探究了风险管理价值创造目标对规划与控制系统纳入风险考量程度的影响。通过结合详尽的问卷调查回复与档案数据，我们得以呈现各类风险导向型规划控制实践的应用现状，分析这些实践如何随风险管理目标而变化，并揭示风险导向型规划控制实践与风险管理目标对组织绩效的影响。研究结果凸显了风险管理价值创造目标对风险导向型规划控制实践应用及其效益的重要影响：相较于那些更全面权衡风险正反两面的组织，主要关注预算内风险最小化或降低风险总成本的企业往往较少采用此类实践，其股价波动性更高，最终实现的企业价值也较低。资源链接: IncorporatingRiskConsiderations into Planning andControlSystems: The Influence ofRiskManagement Value Creation Objectives",

        "content": "Purpose: We address the issue that calculative practices build on socially constructed facts that have both subjective and objective components. We take a pragmatic-constructivist stance to explore how such a tool might be integrated in actor-based Management Control Systems Using risk management as an example. We propose a conceptual framework and a research agenda that accounts for actorship (Nørreklit, 2013) beyond numerical facts. Methodology: This paper is conceptual and draws on secondary literature. Findings: Our framework highlights the non-linear, iterative nature of integrating calculative practices that specifically require complex reflection concerning the [1] validation if possibilities are factual (combining subjective and numerical data), [2] the elimination of illusions and sur-realities through constructive conflict/dialectical management, and [3] the co-construction of organization-wide topoi (causality and pertinent accounting practices). Limitations: We emphasize that the pragmatics in our approach dictate that construct causality is not universal, so that actors have to be reflective when applying this framework. Originality: Our research furthers practice research on calculative practices through the development of a prescriptive rather than descriptive framework. It also offers propositions that future case study researchers can use.目的：我们探讨计算实践基于同时包含主观与客观成分的社会建构事实这一问题。采用实用主义-建构主义立场，以风险管理为例，研究如何将此类工具整合至基于行动者的管理控制系统中。我们提出了一个超越数字事实、涵盖行动主体性（Nørreklit, 2013）的概念框架与研究议程。方法：本文为概念性研究，基于二手文献。发现：我们的框架强调整合计算实践的非线性、迭代特性，尤其需要围绕以下方面进行复杂反思：[1]验证可能性是否为事实（结合主观与客观数据）；[2]通过建设性冲突/辩证管理消除幻想与超现实；[3]共同构建组织范围内的共识基础（因果关系及相关会计实践）。局限：我们强调该方法中的实用性要求建构的因果关系并非普适，因此行动者在应用此框架时需保持反思性。创新：本研究通过开发规范性而非描述性框架，推进了计算实践的实践研究，并为未来案例研究者提供了可验证的命题。资源链接: A Pragmatic-Constructivist Approach toRiskManagement",

The world is facing multiple crises of sustainability: global financial crisis, climate change, and the overuse of natural resources. Many developing countries are additionally destabilized by poverty, disease, corruption, and failures in democratic governance and education. The transition to a green economy is recognized by a variety of organizations and experts as a ground-breaking way forward, combining economic development, social welfare and environmental protection. In order to shift to a green economy, changes in production and consumption practices, and therefore also in trade patterns, are crucial. This makes the leverage power of leading export credit agencies, which totaled an exposure of USD 1.7 trillion in 2011, colossal.本文探讨了利用贸易融资促进发展中国家绿色经济发展的潜力。世界正面临多重可持续性危机：全球金融危机、气候变化以及自然资源的过度消耗。许多发展中国家还因贫困、疾病、腐败以及民主治理和教育体系的失效而陷入动荡。各类组织和专家均认同，向绿色经济转型是结合经济发展、社会福利与环境保护的创新之路。要实现绿色经济转型，改变生产消费模式及贸易格局至关重要。这使得主要出口信贷机构的杠杆力量（2011年总风险敞口达1.7万亿美元）具有巨大影响力。资源链接: Harnessing PublicTradeFinance to Foster a Green Economy in Developing Countries: .

        "content": "While greater focus has been cast on analysis of policy changes affecting trade in goods in the aftermath of the financial crisis, little is known about the direction of policies affecting trade in services. On the basis of information contained in the I-TIP Services database, this paper provides an overview of the evolution of services trade policies since 2000, where policy changes – whether towards more liberalization or more protection – tend to be less easily reversible and to have a greater impact. Has protectionism increased in the aftermath of the crisis?  Which countries, sectors and modes of supply have been associated with most trade facilitating and trade-restrictive measures?  The evidence gathered contradicts in many respects basic political economy expectations.  Indeed, the countries, sectors and modes of supply where liberalizing and protectionist measures have been implemented are not necessarily those one would have assumed.  Most importantly, trade-facilitating measures have clearly outweighed trade-restrictive ones over the recent period, including after the onset of the crisis.  This strong push towards autonomous liberalization bodes well for trade negotiations on trade in services.  The undertaking of greater commitments would bring benefits by consolidating this recent liberalization and by helping to reduce non-negligible outbursts of protectionism that have been witnessed over the last years.  However, bilateral and plurilateral agreements, because of their limited country coverage, would only capture a fraction of the recent autonomous liberalization and, similarly, only help prevent part of the protectionist measures springing up.金融危机过后，尽管对影响货物贸易的政策变化分析得到了更多关注，但人们对影响服务贸易的政策方向知之甚少。基于I-TIP服务数据库中的信息，本文概述了自2000年以来服务贸易政策的演变趋势——这些政策变化（无论是趋向更自由化还是更保护主义）往往较难逆转，且影响更为深远。危机后保护主义是否加剧？哪些国家、行业和供应模式与最多的贸易便利化和贸易限制措施相关？所收集的证据在许多方面与政治经济学的基本预期相悖。事实上，实施自由化与保护主义措施的国家、行业和供应模式未必是人们通常假设的那些。最重要的是，近段时期（包括危机爆发后）贸易便利化措施明显超过了贸易限制措施。这种自主自由化的强劲势头为服务贸易谈判带来了良好前景。通过巩固近期的自由化成果并抑制过去几年不可忽视的保护主义抬头，更大程度的承诺将带来显著收益。然而，由于覆盖国家有限，双边和诸边协定仅能体现近期自主自由化的一小部分，同样也只能预防部分保护主义措施的滋生。资源链接: Charting the Evolving Landscape of ServicesTradePolicies: Recent Patterns of Protection and Liberalization",

        "content": "In the period following the global financial crisis high profile regulatory breaches and other instances of banks’ misconduct triggered widespread concern that the culture and standards of conduct in banks had declined to a point of unacceptability. The crisis also brought into sharp focus the inability of banks to completely and accurately report the risks they accept in order to create shareholder value. These events and circumstances culminated in a crisis of trust between banks and their stakeholders that include governments, regulators, investors and customers. In this same period regulators focused on their primary ‘capital-at-risk’ regimes administered through the Basel capital accords, reinforcing additional levels of capital as a bank’s primary protection against unexpected losses. At the same time Basel introduced ‘firm-at-risk’ mandates that required improvements in banks’ control over risk data and associated technology infrastructure. The most significant game changing post-crisis regulatory mandate in this regard is the Basel Committee’s principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting also known as ‘BCBS 239’. This new mandate requires banks: to implement controls over risk data that are as robust as those applicable to accounting data; to create accurate and single authoritative sources of risk data; and to ensure the precision, timeliness, comprehensiveness and adaptability of risk reporting. BCBS 239 effectively sets the parameters for enterprise risk management (ERM) and provides the foundation on which risk governance and risk cultures can positively evolve. Whereas BCBS 239 expressly states that a common risk metric for all forms of risk is not required, the authors challenge this thinking and argue that it is only through the adoption of a common risk metric that the objectives of BCBS 239 can be reasonably achieved. Part 1 of this paper explains why bankers – risk managers and accountants in particular – must view the need for the convergence of finance and risk systems within a common control and reporting framework as an imperative. Part 2 describes the ‘Risk Accounting’ methodology and its introduction of both a common measurement framework for all forms of risk and a common risk metric, the ‘Risk Unit’ or RU.全球金融危机后的一段时期，高调的违规事件和银行的其他不当行为引发了广泛担忧，人们认为银行的文化和行为标准已降至不可接受的水平。这场危机还突显出银行无法完整准确地报告其为创造股东价值所承担的风险。这些事件和情况最终导致银行与包括政府、监管机构、投资者和客户在内的利益相关方之间出现信任危机。同一时期，监管机构重点关注通过《巴塞尔资本协议》实施的”风险资本”核心监管框架，通过强化多级资本要求，将其作为银行抵御意外损失的主要保障。与此同时，巴塞尔委员会推出了”机构风险”监管要求，规定银行必须加强对风险数据及相关技术基础设施的控制。这方面最具变革性的危机后监管要求，当属巴塞尔委员会《有效风险数据汇总与风险报告原则》（又称BCBS 239）。这项新规要求银行：实施与会计数据同等严格的风险数据管控；建立准确且唯一权威的风险数据来源；确保风险报告的精确性、及时性、全面性和适应性。BCBS 239实质上为企业风险管理（ERM）设定了参数，并为风险治理和风险文化的良性发展奠定了基础。虽然BCBS 239明确指出不需要对所有风险采用统一计量标准，但本文作者对此提出质疑，认为只有采用统一风险计量标准，才能合理实现BCBS 239的目标。本文第一部分阐述了为何银行从业者（尤其是风险管理人员和会计师）必须将财务与风险系统在统一管控和报告框架下的融合视为当务之急。第二部分介绍”风险会计”方法，该方法为所有风险形式建立了统一的计量框架，并引入通用风险计量单位——”风险单位”（RU）。资源链接: RiskAccounting: TheRiskData Aggregation andRiskReporting (BCBS 239) Foundation of EnterpriseRiskManagement(ERM) andRiskGovernance",

        "content": "IP networks have supported voice communications for some time. Voice over IP (VoIP) services allow users to make calls between IP-based endpoints and to interconnect with the traditional public switched telephone network. VoIP applications use a variety of methods and protocols to manage connections and exchange media (i.e., the content of voice or video communications) over IP-based networks such as the Internet. In the majority of VoIP applications, connections are managed or controlled using one protocol or set of protocols, and the media is exchanged among the parties involved in the connection using a different transport protocol or set of protocols. The purpose of these separate connection control and signaling protocols is to allow the parties involved in the communication to establish, control, and terminate connections.  Many services that provide VoIP capability also support other forms of real-time media (video or screen sharing, for example). This report uses the term VoIP impairment to refer to anything that prevents a VoIP application from being used in the manner desired by a user. An impairment affecting a VoIP service can occur anywhere along the data path, including in the end devices. For example, impairment may be the result of actions by a network operator, the VoIP provider itself, or the provider of a smartphone’s operating system. Impairment could likewise be the result of a poorly implemented network device or application, or may occur as a result of a configuration or misconfiguration of a home network. VoIP services can be rendered unusable if their quality is sufficiently reduced to prevent meaningful audio exchange between the participants, even if some VoIP traffic is still exchanged. VoIP failure, as defined in this report, encompasses particular kinds of VoIP impairments that arise when VoIP calls cannot be established at all, or when no media is capable of being exchanged between VoIP endpoints. When network operators, VoIP providers, operating system vendors, or application store providers take steps that cause VoIP failures or prevent VoIP from being used, those steps are considered VoIP restrictions for the purposes of this report. The term VoIP impairments (plural) is used as shorthand for VoIP impairment, failure, or restrictions in this report. Issues related to interoperability between different VoIP services are out of scope. This report discusses: (1) how VoIP works; (2) how VoIP may be impaired or restricted;   (3) methods for mitigating VoIP impairments; and (4) recommendations concerning VoIP impairment, failure, and restrictions. The report focuses on VoIP impairments that may occur in residential or mobile networks. This report makes no assumptions concerning the motivations behind actions that result in VoIP impairment, failure, or restrictions, or about the frequency or scale of such occurrences. There are a variety of technical causes of VoIP impairment, failure, and restrictions: Port blocking. In the architecture of the Internet, communication between two systems is identified by five fields: (1) the source IP address, (2) the destination IP address, (3) the transport protocol in use, (4) the source port, and (5) the destination port used by the transport protocol. The pair of IP addresses representing two systems identifies all of the communication sessions between them, whereas the port number pair characterizes an individual communication session between the two systems. If traffic is prevented from flowing to or from the particular ports used by VoIP applications, VoIP failure can occur. This practice is known as port blocking. Application-Level Gateways (ALGs). Many endpoints on the Internet sit behind a Network Address Translation (NAT) device. NAT allows multiple end devices within a local network (the network in a single home, for example) to share a single public IP address. NAT is challenging for applications such as VoIP that require reachability from the Internet. A variety of mechanisms have been developed for overcoming these challenges, including the use of Application-Level Gateways (ALGs), which can automatically detect traffic associated with particular VoIP services and help that traffic pass through NAT devices. However, ALGs may also affect traffic handling in such a manner as to impair the correct operation of other VoIP services. Other network-based causes. The use of some network-based techniques that attempt to identify VoIP requests or VoIP traffic may result in VoIP impairment. These techniques may leverage the Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure, deep packet inspection, or network-based flow policing and filtering that attempt to identify patterns of likely VoIP traffic. Restrictions based on device, application, or application store. Actions taken on a device, in a VoIP application, or in an application store may restrict the use or functionality of VoIP applications. These examples often reflect business arrangements or agreements between application store providers, operating system vendors, device manufacturers, and/or mobile carriers. When VoIP impairments occur, it may be very difficult for a user to solve the problem, even for technically sophisticated users. Whether a mitigation or workaround solution exists, and how difficult it may be to implement, depends on the mechanism that is impairing the VoIP connection. If mitigation options are unavailable, or if users lack the knowledge or willingness to pursue such, those users may be prevented from using VoIP altogether, or may need to switch to a different VoIP application. Mitigations available to application providers for dealing with VoIP impairment also depend on how the impairments are effectuated. VoIP impairment, failure, and restrictions can create difficulties for VoIP users and may deter adoption of over-the-top VoIP services. VoIP impairments can also create difficulties for the operators of VoIP services and providers of VoIP applications, who may need to troubleshoot or work around impairments (where possible) to enable or restore their users’ connectivity. BITAG’s Technical Working Group recommends the following to minimize the occurrences and impact of VoIP impairment, failure, and restrictions:  [see report for recommendations]IP网络支持语音通信已有一段时间。基于IP的语音(VoIP)服务允许用户在基于IP的终端之间通话，并与传统的公共交换电话网络互联。VoIP应用采用多种方法和协议在基于IP的网络（如互联网）上管理连接并交换媒体（即语音或视频通信内容）。大多数VoIP应用中，连接管理采用一种或一组协议，而媒体传输则使用另一套不同的传输协议。这种分离的连接控制与信令协议旨在让通信各方建立、控制和终止连接。许多提供VoIP功能的业务也支持其他实时媒体形式（如视频或屏幕共享）。本报告将”VoIP损伤”定义为任何阻碍用户按预期方式使用VoIP应用的情况。VoIP服务损伤可能发生在数据路径的任何环节，包括终端设备。损伤可能源自网络运营商、VoIP服务商、智能手机操作系统提供方的操作，也可能是网络设备或应用实现缺陷所致，或是家庭网络配置错误的结果。当语音质量严重下降到无法进行有效交流时（即使仍有部分VoIP流量传输），VoIP服务即被视为不可用。本报告定义的”VoIP故障”特指完全无法建立VoIP呼叫或终端间无法交换媒体的情况。当相关方采取导致VoIP故障或阻碍使用的措施时，这些行为在本报告中称为”VoIP限制”。”VoIP损伤”（复数形式）在本报告中泛指损伤、故障或限制现象。不同VoIP服务间的互操作性问题不在讨论范围内。. . 本报告涵盖：(1)VoIP工作原理；(2)VoIP可能遭受的损伤与限制；(3)缓解损伤的方法；(4)相关建议。重点研究住宅和移动网络中的VoIP损伤现象，不预设立场推测损伤背后的动机，也不评估发生频率或规模。VoIP损伤、故障和限制的技术成因包括：端口封锁（阻止流量通过VoIP应用特定端口）、应用层网关（ALG可能干扰其他VoIP服务正常运行）、其他基于网络的识别技术（如DNS查询、深度包检测、流量整形过滤等）。设备、应用或应用商店层面的限制通常反映应用商店、操作系统商、设备制造商与移动运营商之间的商业协议。. . 对于用户而言，VoIP损伤问题往往难以自行解决——即便技术娴熟的用户也是如此。能否找到缓解方案及实施难度取决于具体损伤机制。若无可行方案或用户缺乏解决能力，可能导致完全无法使用VoIP或被迫更换应用。服务提供商应对损伤的能力同样取决于损伤实施方式。这些障碍不仅阻碍用户使用，抑制OTT VoIP服务普及，也为VoIP运营商和应用提供商带来运维挑战。BITAG技术工作组提出若干建议以最小化VoIP损伤、故障和限制的发生及影响（具体建议参见报告原文）。资源链接: VoIP Impairment, Failure, and Restrictions",

        "content": "The Internet, as is the case with many other networks such as highways and electricity grids, operates under the assumption that capacity will be set to a level such that total peak demand will occasionally exceed capacity. Further, the Internet is designed so that multiple users may dynamically share capacity and multiple services may share the same network links and routers, which is more efficient than offering individual users dedicated capacity or different services using separate links and routers. Every link and router in the various networks that make up the Internet has a limit on its capacity to handle data. The capacity of each link and router in individual networks is determined by the equipment installed by the entity that runs each network in an attempt to optimize performance and cost; the lower the capacity relative to expected demand, the greater the probability that demand upon that link or router at times may exceed its capacity. Significantly, a user’s instantaneous demand for broadband Internet is bursty, meaning that it changes rapidly in time – and when aggregate instantaneous demand exceeds capacity on a network it causes congestion, which can degrade performance. Network operators typically estimate demand months to years in advance, and use such demand estimates to plan a schedule for capacity upgrades. Since it may take months to implement a capacity upgrade, the time scale for managing congestion in this manner is months to years. Thus, although capacity planning can greatly affect how much congestion occurs on a network over time, it cannot react to congestion as it occurs. The impact of congestion upon applications depends on the duration of congestion – which can vary from thousandths of a second up to hours or more – and the nature and design of the application. If the duration of congestion is short enough or the application is tolerant enough of congestion, a user will not notice any degradation in performance. Congestion is thus a problem only when its duration is long enough to be disruptive to applications. Congestion in a network can occur for a wide variety of reasons, some of which can be anticipated and some of which cannot. This report describes how network resources are allocated on a short time scale in order to, among other objectives, manage congestion on the network, and how such congestion management impacts applications and users. Congestion management practices are an important subset of network management practices implemented by a variety of parties or organizations, including Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Application Service Providers (ASPs). Policymakers have expressed great interest in learning what congestion management practices are used in the Internet and how these practices impact users and the broader Internet ecosystem. Furthermore, an understanding of congestion management techniques and practices is crucial in discussions about reasonable network management. One of the key design questions about any congestion management practice concerns the subset of network traffic to which the practice is applied, and its impact upon users and applications. Network operators apply some practices to all traffic on their networks, whereas in other cases practices are applied only to the traffic of specific users or to the traffic associated with specific applications. Application- or user- based congestion management practices may achieve better performance for selected applications. They also may enable service providers to offer connectivity products that cater to particular customer’s tastes or needs. However, they add complexity, which may result in added costs that each network operator will evaluate. In some cases application- or user- based congestion management practices may be harmful to applications. Congestion management practices are composed of generic technical building blocks, described in this report as traffic management “techniques”. This report discusses a range of user- and application- based congestion management techniques, including classification of packets, reservation of resources for particular network flows, storage of content in multiple locations, rate control, routing and traffic engineering, packet dropping, and packet scheduling. Congestion management techniques may be combined to offer a collection of capabilities in various network architectures, and can create services with differentiated performance either within an operator’s network or end-to-end. There are also architecture-specific implementations of congestion management techniques for broadband Internet access over cable, telephone, and cellular networks and for Content Delivery Networks. The offerings of a service provider often include multiple services that may utilize the same network links and routers. While there are benefits and efficiencies to sharing capacity between multiple services, such sharing of capacity also requires the use of congestion management practices. Congestion management “practices” are the uses of particular techniques by particular network operators to avoid, limit, or manage congestion.  This report illustrates a range of congestion management practices that show how providers may combine user- or application- based congestion management techniques, including traffic shaping, prioritization, transcoding, resource reservation, and preferential treatment. The report begins in Sections 1 and 2 by giving an overview of congestion and BITAG’s interest in the issue. Section 3 defines congestion and describes instances in which congestion can occur, the locations in the network where congestion can occur, the indicators of congestion, and the impact congestion can have on applications. In Section 4, the report articulates the differences between congestion management techniques and congestion management practices, and describes the different time scales at which congestion can be seen to occur in the network. This section also describes the parties that implement congestion management practices and on what basis. Although all congestion management is important, in order to limit scope and length Sections 5-7 focus on congestion management techniques and practices that: (1) are implemented or potentially implemented in a network that supports consumer broadband Internet access services; (2) act on a time scale of minutes or less; (3) are used for purposes of congestion management; and (4) are based on user or application. In Section 5, the report focuses on specific congestion management techniques. Section 6 gives specific examples of congestion management practices that are based on user or application. Finally, Section 7 gives the Technical Working Group’s recommendations.互联网与公路网、电网等其他许多网络一样，其运行机制基于一个前提：容量设定在峰值需求偶尔会超出供给的水平。更高效的设计在于允许多用户动态共享带宽，多服务共用相同网络链路与路由器，而非为单个用户分配专属带宽或为不同服务配置独立链路。构成互联网的每段链路与每台路由器都存在数据处理能力上限，各子网中这些设备的容量由运营方根据性能与成本优化原则配置——容量与预期需求的比值越低，链路或路由器出现过载的概率就越高。值得注意的是，用户对宽带网络的瞬时需求具有突发性，当聚合瞬时需求超过网络容量时就会引发拥塞，导致性能下降。运营商通常需提前数月乃至数年预测需求，据此规划容量升级。由于扩容实施周期可能长达数月，这种拥塞管理的时间尺度为月级至年级。虽然容量规划能显著影响长期拥塞程度，但无法实时应对突发拥塞。拥塞对应用的影响取决于其持续时间（从毫秒级到小时级不等）及应用特性。只有当拥塞持续时间足以干扰应用时才会构成问题。网络拥塞成因复杂，部分可预见而部分不可控。本报告阐述网络资源在微观时间尺度上的分配机制（包括拥塞管理方法）及其对应用与用户的影响。拥塞管理实践是网络管理体系的重要组成，由互联网服务提供商（ISP）和应用服务提供商（ASP）等主体实施。政策制定者高度关注互联网拥塞管理实践及其对用户和生态的影响，理解这些技术对讨论合理网络管理至关重要。任何拥塞管理方案的核心设计问题都涉及作用对象（特定流量/用户/应用）及其影响。全域流量管理方案与定向管理方案各有优劣：后者可为特定应用优化性能，或满足个性化服务需求，但会增加复杂度与成本，甚至可能损害其他应用。拥塞管理实践由通用技术模块构成，本报告称之为”流量管理技术”，包括数据包分类、流量资源预留、内容分布式存储、速率控制、路由与流量工程、丢包策略及分组调度等。这些技术可通过不同组合形成差异化服务能力，在有线、电话、蜂窝网络及内容分发网络（CDN）中各有特定实现。服务商常将多业务部署于相同网络设备，共享容量虽提升效率，但也依赖拥塞管理。”拥塞管理实践”特指运营商运用具体技术应对拥塞的操作方法。本报告通过流量整形、优先级划分、转码、资源预留及优待策略等案例，展示用户/应用导向的实践组合。报告结构如下：第1-2章概述拥塞问题及BITAG的关注背景；第3章明确定义，分析拥塞发生场景、位置、表征及对应用的影响；第4章区分技术与实践，阐述不同时间尺度下的拥塞表现及实施主体；为聚焦研究范围，第5-7章重点讨论符合以下特征的案例：(1)应用于消费者宽带接入网络；(2)作用于分钟级以下时间尺度；(3)以拥塞管理为目的；(4)基于用户或应用属性。第5章详解具体技术，第6章提供定向管理实践案例，第7章陈述技术工作组建议。资源链接: Real-Time Network Management of Internet Congestion",

        "tags": "Port  blocking  port blocking  internet  net neutrality  networking  BITAG  multistakeholder  open internet ",
        "content": "Executive Summary: The term “port blocking” refers to the practice of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) identifying Internet traffic by the combination of port number and transport protocol, and blocking it entirely. Port blocking thus affects the traffic associated with a particular combination of port number and transport protocol on that ISP, regardless of source or destination IP address. The practice can potentially prevent the use of particular applications altogether by blocking the ports those applications use. Port blocks can be deployed in a range of network locations, from where the ISP connects with other networks to data centers and customer locations. The Internet was built around the premise of an open and shared environment. Additionally, Internet standards assume all hosts on the global Internet can connect directly to each other, on any specified port number. The practical reality is that blocking of Internet port numbers, either in the short or long term, is a technique that has been used by both wireline and wireless network providers for various reasons for over a decade. One of the original and enduring motivations for blocking ports is to prevent network attacks and abuse associated with particular application protocols.  Some network and security administrators view port blocking as a critical tool for securing systems and information, and see it as part of the ISP’s mission to manage the security risk to its users from theft and destruction of personal information, business records, and other critical electronic forms of information. TCP port 25, used for sending email, is an example of a port that is blocked by some operators to prevent network abuse – such as spam email. Port blocking has also been used to enforce ISPs’ terms of service. Likewise, port blocking was once viewed as a useful tool for managing capacity and bandwidth-intensive applications such as peer-to-peer file-sharing applications on enterprise and university networks. However, increased network capacity and a variety of developments in the application space have caused most residential ISPs to seek other ways of managing capacity. Finally, though rare, port blocking has at times been used to hinder competing applications, such as Voice over IP (VoIP). Port blocking is among a set of tools and tactics (Network Address Translation (NAT) being the other major example) that can compromise the original intent of ports: to provide reliable local addresses so that end systems can manage multiple communications at once. Port blocking can complicate application design and development and create uncertainty about whether applications will function properly when they are deployed. Port blocking can also cause applications to not function properly or “break” by preventing applications from using the ports they were designed to use.  One of the outcomes of port blocking is an increase in the use of “port overloading.”  Port overloading is a tactic whereby application developers will design applications to use a common port, in order to minimize the chance of a port blocking practice impacting the usability of that application. Importantly, it may not be obvious to Internet users why an application affected by port blocking is not working properly, because the application may simply be unable to connect or fail silently. If error messages are provided, they may not contain specific details as to the cause of the problem. Users may seek assistance from the ISP’s customer service, online documentation, or other knowledgeable sources if they cannot diagnose the problem themselves. The fact that the problem could alternatively be caused by home networking equipment or a software-based port block complicates the process of diagnosis. Users’ ability to respond to port blocking depends on their technical sophistication and the extent to which workarounds are available. Overcoming port blocking may require the user to install a software update, change a configuration setting, request an opt-out from the ISP, or to upgrade their level of service (for example from residential to business). If these options are not available, or if users or customers lack the knowledge or willingness to pursue them, users may be prevented from using the blocked application altogether, or they may have to switch to a different application or a different network (from wireless to wireline, for example). Because port blocking can affect how particular Internet applications function, its use has the potential to be anti-competitive, discriminatory, otherwise motivated by non-technical factors, or construed as such. As a result, the Broadband Internet Technical Advisory Group (BITAG) has a number of suggested practices when it comes to port blocking: ISPs should avoid port blocking unless they have no reasonable alternatives available for preventing unwanted traffic and protecting users. Further, if port blocking is deemed necessary, it should only be used for the purposes of protecting the implementing ISP’s network and users. Port blocking should not be used for ongoing capacity management, to enforce non-security terms of service, or to disadvantage competing applications. ISPs that can reasonably provide to their users opt-out provisions or exceptions to their port blocking policies should do so.  Whether opt-out provisions can be supported may depend on the particulars of the access network technology, the location port blocking is implemented in the network, administrative complexity, cost, and other factors. ISPs should publicly disclose their port blocking policies. The information should be readily available to both customers and non-customers alike, and should be as informative and concise as possible. For example, port blocking policies could be provided on the ISP’s public facing website, on a page dedicated to…[see report for remainder of recommendations].执行摘要：“端口阻断”一词指的是互联网服务提供商（ISP）通过端口号与传输协议的组合来识别互联网流量，并完全阻断该流量的做法。因此，端口阻断会影响该ISP上与特定端口号和传输协议组合相关的所有流量，无论源或目标IP地址如何。这种做法可能通过阻断应用程序使用的端口，彻底阻止特定应用的使用。端口阻断可部署在从ISP与其他网络连接到数据中心和客户位置的各种网络节点中。  . . 互联网的构建前提是一个开放共享的环境。此外，互联网标准假设全球互联网上的所有主机可以在任何指定端口上直接相互连接。但现实情况是，无论是短期还是长期，互联网端口号的阻断技术已被有线和无线网络提供商出于各种原因使用超过十年。端口阻断最初且持久的动机之一是防止与特定应用协议相关的网络攻击和滥用。一些网络和安全管理员将端口阻断视为保护系统和信息安全的关键工具，并将其视为ISP管理用户信息安全风险（如个人信息、业务记录和其他关键电子信息的盗窃或破坏）的职责之一。例如，用于发送电子邮件的TCP端口25被某些运营商阻断，以防止网络滥用（如垃圾邮件）。  . . 端口阻断也被用于强制执行ISP的服务条款。同样，端口阻断曾被视为管理容量和带宽密集型应用（如企业和大学网络中的点对点文件共享应用）的有效工具。然而，网络容量的提升以及应用领域的多种发展使得大多数住宅ISP寻求其他方式管理容量。最后，尽管罕见，端口阻断有时也被用于阻碍竞争性应用（如互联网语音协议（VoIP））。  . . 端口阻断属于一系列可能损害端口原始意图的工具和策略（另一主要例子是网络地址转换（NAT）），即提供可靠的本地地址，使终端系统能够同时管理多个通信。端口阻断可能使应用设计和开发复杂化，并导致应用在部署时是否正常工作的不确定性。它还可能导致应用无法正常运行或“失效”，因为应用无法使用其设计使用的端口。端口阻断的一个结果是“端口复用”使用的增加。端口复用是应用开发者设计应用使用通用端口的策略，以最小化端口阻断对该应用可用性的影响。  . . 重要的是，互联网用户可能无法明确知道受端口阻断影响的应用为何无法正常工作，因为应用可能只是无法连接或静默失败。如果提供错误消息，可能不会包含具体的问题原因。用户若无法自行诊断问题，可能会向ISP的客户服务、在线文档或其他知识来源寻求帮助。由于问题也可能由家庭网络设备或基于软件的端口阻断引起，诊断过程变得更加复杂。  . . 用户应对端口阻断的能力取决于其技术水平和可用的解决方法。克服端口阻断可能需要用户安装软件更新、更改配置设置、向ISP申请退出阻断或升级服务级别（例如从住宅升级到商业）。如果这些选项不可用，或用户缺乏相关知识或意愿，用户可能完全无法使用被阻断的应用，或不得不切换到其他应用或网络（例如从无线切换到有线）。  . . 由于端口阻断可能影响特定互联网应用的功能，其使用可能具有反竞争性、歧视性、受非技术因素驱动或被如此解读。因此，宽带互联网技术咨询组（BITAG）提出了一些建议做法：ISP应避免端口阻断，除非没有其他合理替代方案来阻止不需要的流量和保护用户。此外，如果端口阻断确有必要，应仅用于保护实施阻断的ISP网络和用户。端口阻断不应用于持续的容量管理、强制执行非安全相关的服务条款或损害竞争性应用。ISP应尽可能为用户提供退出端口阻断政策的选项或例外。  . . 是否支持退出选项可能取决于接入网络技术的具体情况、端口阻断在网络中的实施位置、管理复杂性、成本等因素。ISP应公开披露其端口阻断政策。相关信息应易于客户和非客户获取，并尽可能简明扼要。例如，端口阻断政策可在ISP的公开网站上提供，放在专门页面中……[其余建议详见报告]。资源链接: Port Blocking",

        "content": "Executive Summary: The Internet is running out of addresses in the format in which they were originally standardized, known as IPv4, due to aspects of that format which constrain the address space to a relatively “small” number of unique addresses as compared to the burgeoning number of devices requiring those same addresses to function on the Internet. A successor address format, IPv6, has been developed to support as many devices as can conceivably be connected to the Internet for the foreseeable future. While the global transition to IPv6 is in progress, it is going to take a number of years to upgrade all Internet applications and services, consumer electronics devices, and networks to support IPv6. The transition period is also likely to be lengthy given that, among other things, IPv4-only equipment is still being manufactured and sold to consumers. As network operators deploy IPv6 technology into their existing IPv4 networks, IPv4 and IPv6 will thus need to co-exist until the demand for IPv4 services diminishes. Given the amount of time it may take to migrate out of a pure IPv4, or mixed IPv4 and IPv6 network environment, to pure IPv6 service, network operators are employing a variety of techniques to extend the life of IPv4 addressing. One such technique is the use of Large Scale Network Address Translation (also known as Large Scale NAT or LSN). LSN equipment allows a large number of IPv4-enabled end devices to share a single public IPv4 address. Network Address Translation (NAT) functionality has long existed in local/private networks to help network operators manage their network addresses using private address space. NAT functionality is known to adversely impact some Internet applications; wider use of NAT as part of LSN therefore deserves careful examination. The BITAG is interested in LSN given that IP address sharing is a key tool for extending the life of IPv4 during the transition to IPv6.  LSN is likely to affect many players in the Internet ecosystem: ISPs, end users, application providers, equipment vendors, content delivery networks, and third parties such as law enforcement agencies. A broad understanding of problems that may arise has the following benefits: (1) it will help stakeholders to prepare for actions that minimize the impact on end users and applications; (2) it will inform policymakers and regulators of the motivations and trade-offs for the deployment of this technology; (3) it will accelerate the transition to IPv6; and (4) it will more generally help to reduce or preclude friction and/or conflict surrounding use of this technique among stakeholders, as some have argued that Large Scale NAT could be abused by parties for anti-competitive, discriminatory, or other non-technical purposes. LSN Deployments and Impacts: LSN will be deployed in different ways depending on which IPv6 transition technologies are in use. These alternatives are discussed in the body of this paper. For all of these alternatives, there are a variety of technical implications of LSN for end users, ISPs, and application providers to consider. The address sharing enabled by LSN use impacts end users in three primary ways: (1) the number of connections available per user is affected, (2) the ability to uniquely identify an end user device solely via the source IP address is lost, and (3) it becomes much more difficult to reach and maintain connectivity to end user devices.  All of these impacts are present in local/private network implementation of NATs.  Introduction of LSN increases the probability that users will be affected due to sharing of the port number space. The number of users affected by the limitation in port availability may also increase for the same reason.  However, note that a user checking email or performing simple web browsing functions will not be affected by the LSN. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) electing to use LSNs must balance the impacts of new network infrastructure (operational and capital costs) and of engineering this new infrastructure for scalability, resiliency, security, and capacity, as well as meeting mandates to be able to log individual customer IP address assignments, with maintaining an appropriate level of customer service.  In the mobile environment, where every device must be assigned at least one IP address and where simple devices may have limited access to Internet applications, mobile operators have already implemented LSN and faced some of these challenges. However, the continued swift growth in the number of mobile customers and their likely evolution toward expecting wireless Internet service to behave in a manner comparable to wireline service presents new challenges. LSN can have a wide variety of impacts on applications. These may relate to capacity constraints if the LSN is undersized, the handling of multiple connections to the same application server, the loss of IP-based geolocation capability, new logging requirements, and a variety of other factors. Recommendations: BITAG has compiled recommendations regarding steps that can be taken to help ensure optimal user experience, balanced with efficient LSN deployments and operations.

LSN部署与影响：根据采用的IPv6过渡技术差异，LSN存在多种部署方案（本报告正文详述）。无论采用何种方案，LSN对终端用户、ISP和应用提供商均会产生多重技术影响。地址共享主要通过三种方式影响终端用户：(1) 限制单用户可用连接数；(2) 无法仅通过源IP唯一识别终端设备；(3) 终端设备可达性与连接稳定性显著降低。这些影响在局域网的NAT实施中同样存在，但LSN因端口号空间共享会提高用户受影响概率，端口可用性限制波及的用户规模也可能扩大。需说明的是，普通网页浏览或邮件收发等基础功能不受LSN影响。采用LSN的ISP需权衡新网络基础设施（运营与资金成本）的投入规模，在确保可扩展性、弹性、安全性和容量的工程化设计，满足客户IP地址分配记录留存要求，与维持适当服务水平之间取得平衡。在移动网络环境中，由于每台设备至少需分配一个IP地址且简易设备对互联网应用的访问能力有限，运营商已先行部署LSN并应对部分挑战。然而移动用户持续激增及其对无线互联网服务体验向有线服务看齐的预期演进，带来了新的挑战。LSN对应用的影响多元：包括设备容量不足导致的性能约束、同一应用服务器的多连接处理、基于IP的地理定位功能失效、新增日志记录要求等诸多因素。. . 建议：BITAG已汇编相关建议以帮助实现最佳用户体验与高效LSN部署运营的平衡。具体建议详见报告内容。资源链接: IPv6 Large Scale Network Address Translation (NAT)",

        "content": "Executive Summary: Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the new form of addressing for the Internet. IPv6 is being deployed as a result of the exhaustion of the supply of the older form of addressing, Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4). The Internet is now beginning a global transition from IPv4 to IPv6, although most websites and networks will run both address families in parallel for many years. This document describes the emerging practice of Internet web sites (or, more broadly, “Internet domains”), such as example.com, selectively returning IPv6-related resources from Domain Name System (DNS) servers. As a result, the domain can enable or disable a network (and, as a consequence, that network’s users) from accessing the domain’s content over IPv6. This practice is known as “DNS Whitelisting” and is intended as a means to smooth the global transition from IPv4 to IPv6. DNS Whitelisting was first used by major web content sites. These web site operators observed that when they added IPv6 records to their DNS servers in order to support IPv6 access to their content, a fraction of end users had slow or otherwise impaired access to this content. Major domains are motivated by a desire to maintain a high-quality user experience for all of their users, as well as to shift traffic to IPv6 in a controlled manner. Thus, domains engaging in DNS Whitelisting are attempting to shield users with impaired access from the symptoms of those impairments until they can be remedied. Those domains are also interested in having a degree of control over their own migration to IPv6 that they would otherwise lack without DNS Whitelisting, so that IPv6 traffic can be added gradually as IPv6 operations and network practices mature. At the same time, critics of the practice have articulated a range of technical and non-technical concerns and are focused on ensuring that DNS Whitelisting, when implemented, is done in a manner that is transparent, non-discriminatory, and not anti-competitive. Generally speaking, a domain that implements DNS Whitelisting does so manually. This means that the domain manually maintains a list of networks that are permitted to receive IPv6 records (via their DNS resolver IP addresses) and that these networks typically submit applications in order to be added to the DNS Whitelist. Domain operators foresee that a second phase of DNS Whitelisting may emerge in the future, possibly in the near future. In this new phase a domain would return IPv6 and/or IPv4 records dynamically based on automatically detected technical capabilities, location, or other factors. It would then function much like (or as part of) global server load balancing, a common suite of practices already in use today. Furthermore, in this second phase, networks might be added to and removed from a DNS Whitelist automatically, and possibly on a near-real-time basis. This means that networks may no longer need to apply to be added to a whitelist, which could alleviate some of the issues addressed herein. Since this future phase has yet to emerge, this document and its suggestions apply only to the DNS Whitelisting practices currently known to the BITAG. The BITAG reserves its opinion on future alternative practices until they can be articulated and evaluated. Although current implementations are not perceived to have this impact, the BITAG is interested in this issue on that grounds that, without careful and monitored deployment, some whitelisting services could in the future be viewed as anti-competitive, discriminatory or in violation of some other public policy objective. The practice may be viewed as controversial and the manner in which it is employed could result in concerns or complaints. As a result, it is important to inform the public and policymakers about why DNS Whitelisting is used and how it functions, to identify concerns surrounding its use, and to outline some potential implementation steps that domains could take to minimize the risk of complaints and controversy. The BITAG has formulated a set of suggested practices regarding the implementation of DNS Whitelisting to help reduce such complaints, acknowledging that practices may vary as a domain moves from experimentation with whitelisting and IPv6 to a point of operational stability.执行摘要：互联网协议第六版（IPv6）是新一代互联网寻址形式。由于旧版寻址协议IPv4地址资源枯竭，IPv6正逐步部署。尽管大多数网站和网络将在未来多年并行支持两种地址体系，全球互联网已开始从IPv4向IPv6过渡。本文阐述了互联网域名（如example.com）通过域名系统（DNS）服务器选择性返回IPv6相关资源的新兴实践。该机制使得域名管理者能按需控制特定网络（及该网络用户）通过IPv6访问内容的能力，这种被称为”DNS白名单”的技术旨在平滑全球IPv6过渡进程。. . DNS白名单最初由大型内容网站采用。这些运营商发现，当他们在DNS服务器添加IPv6记录以支持IPv6访问时，部分终端用户会出现访问延迟或质量下降的情况。主要域名运营商既希望维持所有用户的高质量体验，又需要可控地迁移IPv6流量，因此通过白名单机制暂时隔离存在访问障碍的用户，直至问题解决。该技术也使运营商能自主掌控IPv6迁移节奏，随着IPv6运营和网络实践的成熟逐步增加流量。. . 批评者则从技术与非技术层面提出诸多质疑，强调白名单实施过程应保持透明、非歧视且不违反公平竞争原则。当前白名单主要通过人工维护：运营商手动管理允许接收IPv6记录的网络列表（基于其DNS解析器IP地址），相关网络通常需提交申请才能加入白名单。业界预期未来可能出现第二阶段演进——基于自动检测的技术能力、地理位置等因素动态返回IPv6/IPv4记录，其功能将类似于（或作为）当前已广泛应用的全局服务器负载均衡系统。在此阶段，网络可能实现近实时自动增减白名单，从而缓解现行机制的部分问题。. . 鉴于第二阶段尚未成形，本文建议仅针对BITAG已知的现行白名单实践。BITAG对尚未明确的未来实践持保留意见。虽然目前未发现负面影响，但BITAG关注到若缺乏审慎部署，某些白名单服务可能在未来被视为反竞争、歧视性或违背公共政策目标。该技术可能存在争议，其应用方式可能引发担忧。因此有必要向公众和政策制定者阐明DNS白名单的应用原理，识别潜在问题，并列举可减少争议的实施建议。. . BITAG制定了一套实施建议，帮助降低争议风险，同时承认随着域名运营商从IPv6试验阶段过渡到稳定运营阶段，具体实践可能存在差异。资源链接: IPv6 AAAA DNS Whitelisting",

        "title": "Differentiated Treatment of Internet Traffic",
        "author": "BITAG Technical Working Group",
        "tags": "Internet  networking  differentiation  prioritization ",
        "content": "The Internet is composed of interconnected networks, each having its own architecture and technical characteristics. The data transmitted across these networks is formatted as packets containing information payloads encapsulated within one or more headers, which in turn provide the information needed by networks to deliver the packets to their destinations. As these packets travel across networks, they contend with other packets for network resources. Contention can occur at any point where two or more packets can compete for a resource at the same time. The simplest way to handle such requests would be on a first come, first served basis (also known as First In First Out, or FIFO). In practice, however, network operators make many exceptions to FIFO, using the packet header information to classify packets into flows and treating those flows differently, for example rearranging the order or the timing with which packets are sent, or sending them along different network paths. Differentiated treatment of Internet Access Service traffic has been a subject of debate and regulatory scrutiny. In February 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted Open Internet rules that address paid prioritization as well as other topics. This report touches on a broad range of questions associated with differentiation, but is not intended to address or analyze the economic, legal, regulatory, or public policy issues that the differentiated treatment of Internet access service traffic may raise, focusing instead on the technical issues. The ability to treat traffic differentially has been built into Internet protocols from the beginning. The specifications for both IPv4 and IPv6 have included fields to support traffic differentiation since their inception (initially IPv4’s Type of Service or ToS field) to indicate to routers the quality of service desired, in terms of queuing precedence and routing parameters around delay, rate, and reliability. This was changed to more generic service descriptions with the definition of the Differentiated Services Field, and implemented in IPv4 and IPv6. Notably, traffic differentiation in this sense has not been implemented in multi-provider environments, although it is extensively used within specific networks. End to end deployment would require the harmonization and cooperation of a large number, if not all, of the relevant network operators. In its broadest sense, traffic differentiation includes any technique that classifies and applies potentially different treatment to two or more traffic flows contending for resources on a network (a flow being a group of packets that share a common set of properties). Differentiated treatment of network traffic is a two-part process: (1) traffic is classified into traffic streams, and (2) a prescribed set of actions is applied to each stream. This treatment may determine the order in which routers and switches send packets from different flows across the link, the rate of transmission of a given flow, or even whether certain packets are sent at all. While the techniques used for traffic differentiation overlap with those used to manage congestion, differentiation has a broader purpose that includes meeting service level agreement (SLA) guarantees and selecting paths for traffic from different applications, among other things. Differentiated treatment of traffic can also contribute both to the efficiency of a network and to the predictability of the manner in which network resources are shared. Differentiation can be complex, and a common vocabulary is key. This report uses the terms “differentiated treatment” or “differentiation,” as opposed to “prioritization” when referring to the full range of treatments that may be applied to traffic flows. The technical definition of “prioritization” is narrow and generally applies only to certain scheduling, dropping, and marking techniques. This report uses “differentiation” in a much broader sense, including most of the ways in which packets may be treated differently from each other while en route to their respective destinations across one or more networks. The scope of differentiation in this report encompasses the classic techniques of scheduling, shaping and queue management by which packets are processed at a network node, and also includes the techniques by which traffic flows are segregated or forwarded onto different physical or logical network paths where they may encounter greater or lesser propagation delays or contention for resources. This report addresses differentiation applied to traffic on Internet access services, as well as the impacts to Internet access services when differentiation is applied to other traffic carried over the same network. Traffic for mass-market Internet access services is often carried over a common infrastructure with traffic associated with other IP services, as well as the network management traffic used to control devices and report status from them. Since differential treatment of other network traffic has the potential to affect the performance of Internet access services, it is considered here. The subjective experience perceived by the user of a networked application is known as Quality of Experience, or QoE, and the factors that contribute to QoE vary significantly from one application to the next. In contrast, Quality of Service, or QoS, describes the performance of a network service using objective metrics such as throughput, delay, delay variation, and loss. The relationship between QoS and QoE is highly dependent on the type of application, but variations in QoS have been mapped to corresponding variations in QoE for a number of applications. It is possible to use knowledge about the relationships between network performance parameters and their effects on QoE to attempt to optimize the performance of network flows for their intended applications. Differentiation is often also used to address impairments to QoS. Broadband networks use different network architectures and access technologies. Several of these network architectures have developed to take advantage of existing access infrastructure that was originally deployed for other services – for example, telephone service over twisted copper pairs or video over coaxial cable. Other networks were developed to meet specific needs, such as for mobility or for access in remote rural areas. In many cases, differences in network design can be traced to the different characteristics of the access technology used. [See report for observations and recommendations].互联网由相互连接的网络组成，每个网络都有其自身的架构和技术特性。这些网络间传输的数据被格式化为包含信息负载的数据包，这些负载封装在一个或多个头部中，头部则提供了网络将数据包传递到目的地所需的信息。当这些数据包在网络中传输时，它们会与其他数据包争夺网络资源。争用可能发生在任何两个或多个数据包可以同时竞争资源的地方。处理此类请求的最简单方法是先到先服务（也称为先进先出，FIFO）。然而，在实践中，网络运营商对FIFO做了许多例外处理，利用数据包头信息将数据包分类为流，并对这些流进行不同的处理，例如重新排列数据包的发送顺序或时间，或沿着不同的网络路径发送它们。互联网接入服务流量的差异化处理一直是争论和监管审查的主题。2015年2月，联邦通信委员会（FCC）通过了开放互联网规则，涉及付费优先权以及其他主题。本报告涉及与差异化相关的广泛问题，但无意讨论或分析互联网接入服务流量的差异化处理可能引发的经济、法律、监管或公共政策问题，而是专注于技术问题。从互联网协议诞生之初，差异化处理流量的能力就被内置其中。IPv4和IPv6的规范自诞生以来就包含了支持流量差异化的字段（最初是IPv4的服务类型或ToS字段），用于向路由器指示所需的服务质量，包括排队优先级以及围绕延迟、速率和可靠性的路由参数。随着差异化服务字段的定义，这些字段被改为更通用的服务描述，并在IPv4和IPv6中实现。值得注意的是，这种意义上的流量差异化尚未在多提供商环境中实现，尽管它在特定网络中被广泛使用。端到端的部署需要大量（如果不是全部）相关网络运营商的协调与合作。从最广泛的意义上讲，流量差异化包括任何对争夺网络资源的两个或多个流量流进行分类并可能进行不同处理的技术（流量流是指共享一组共同属性的一组数据包）。网络流量的差异化处理是一个分为两部分的过程：（1）将流量分类为流量流，（2）对每个流应用一组规定的操作。这种处理可能决定路由器和交换机通过链路发送来自不同流的数据包的顺序、给定流的传输速率，甚至是否发送某些数据包。虽然用于流量差异化的技术与用于管理拥塞的技术有重叠，但差异化的目的更广泛，包括满足服务级别协议（SLA）保证和为来自不同应用的流量选择路径等。流量的差异化处理还可以提高网络的效率以及网络资源共享方式的预测性。差异化可能很复杂，统一的术语是关键。本报告使用“差异化处理”或“差异化”这一术语，而不是“优先化”，以指代可能应用于流量流的全部处理方式。“优先化”的技术定义较为狭窄，通常仅适用于某些调度、丢弃和标记技术。本报告以更广泛的意义使用“差异化”，包括数据包在通过一个或多个网络传输到各自目的地的过程中可能受到的不同处理方式的大部分情况。本报告中差异化的范围涵盖了经典的调度、整形和队列管理技术，通过这些技术在网络节点上处理数据包，还包括将流量流分离或转发到不同的物理或逻辑网络路径上的技术，这些路径可能会遇到更多或更少的传播延迟或资源争用。本报告讨论了应用于互联网接入服务流量的差异化，以及当差异化应用于同一网络上承载的其他流量时对互联网接入服务的影响。大众市场互联网接入服务的流量通常与其他IP服务的流量以及用于控制设备和报告状态的网络管理流量共享一个共同的基础设施。由于其他网络流量的差异化处理可能影响互联网接入服务的性能，因此在此予以考虑。网络应用用户感知的主观体验称为体验质量（QoE），而影响QoE的因素因应用而异。相比之下，服务质量（QoS）使用吞吐量、延迟、延迟变化和丢失等客观指标描述网络服务的性能。QoS与QoE之间的关系高度依赖于应用类型，但对于许多应用，QoS的变化已被映射到QoE的相应变化。可以利用网络性能参数及其对QoE影响的知识来尝试优化网络流量的性能以适应其目标应用。差异化也常用于解决对QoS的损害。宽带网络使用不同的网络架构和接入技术。其中一些网络架构的开发是为了利用最初为其他服务部署的现有接入基础设施——例如，通过双绞铜线提供的电话服务或通过同轴电缆提供的视频服务。其他网络则是为了满足特定需求而开发的，例如移动性或偏远农村地区的接入。在许多情况下，网络设计的差异可以追溯到所使用的接入技术的不同特性。[具体观察和建议请参见报告]。资源链接: Differentiated Treatment of Internet Traffic",

        "content": "A core prediction of recent “dual-self” models is that a person’s risk attitudes depend on her current level of self-control. While these models have received a lot of attention, empirical studies tailored to testing their core prediction are lacking. Using two prominent models, we derive precise hypotheses for choices between risky monetary payoffs in a state of low self-control, compared to regular self-control; in particular, lower levels of self-control should induce stronger risk aversion for stakes within a particular range.We test the hypotheses in a lab experiment with a large number of subjects (N = 308), using a well-established self-control depletion task and measuring risk attitudes via finely graduated choice lists. While independent manipulation checks document the effectiveness of our depletion task, we do not find any evidence for increased risk aversion after self-control depletion. Our findings have important implications for the future modeling of decision making under risk.近期“双重自我”模型的一个核心预测是，个人的风险态度取决于其当下的自我控制水平。尽管这些模型备受关注，但专门检验其核心预测的实证研究仍属匮乏。基于两个经典模型，我们推导出关于低自控状态与常态自控状态下风险货币收益选择的精确假设：特定金额范围内，自我控制水平降低应导致更强的风险规避倾向。我们通过实验室实验（样本量N=308）检验这些假设，采用成熟的自控损耗任务并通过精细分级的选择列表测量风险态度。虽然独立操纵检验证实了损耗任务的有效性，但我们未发现自控损耗后风险规避增强的任何证据。本研究发现对风险决策的未来建模具有重要启示。资源链接: Does Self-ControlDepletion AffectRiskAttitudes?",

        "author": "BITAG Technical Working Group",
        "tags": "Internet  interconnection  network ",
        "content": "Executive Summary: The term “interconnection” refers to the various means by which network providers attach to and move traffic between one another, and is a collection of business practices and technical mechanisms that allow individually managed networks to connect together for this purpose. There is no central authority that manages Internet interconnection – the overall system arises because of the many bilateral and multilateral decisions that various actors make to interconnect. In contrast to the telephone system, where interconnection is performed in a highly regulated environment, interconnection in the Internet (in most parts of the world) remains a private-sector matter. The topic of Internet interconnection is receiving increased attention as the Internet ecosystem continues to evolve. Networks of all types interconnect among one another, including those of Internet access providers, content providers, academic institutions, and commercial enterprises. Internet connectivity is achieved by passing pieces of data, called packets, from a connected device through networking equipment, known as routers, operated by one or more network providers until those packets are delivered to the desired destination. The mechanisms that implement interconnection thus serve both technical and business purposes, and discussion concerning the technology of interconnection must, of necessity, refer to business issues to some extent – as many of the mechanisms can only be understood in that context. Network interconnection in the United States has evolved significantly since the early days of the Internet, and today is a complex amalgam of models incorporating new connectivity options, delivery options, traffic management requirements and business practices. It is important to note the difference between the two dominant forms of interconnection, which are: (1) transit – where access to every publicly reachable destination on the Internet is provided for a fee; and (2) peering – where customer traffic is exchanged between two networks and the access provided is only to each other’s network and customers. Further, when two networks peer there can also be both “settlement free” (without requiring payment) and paid arrangements. Network operators are motivated to peer for a variety of reasons that may include both business and technical motivations. Each network operator stipulates the technical and operational criteria used to evaluate what networks they will interconnect with, and many of these requirements are made publicly available online. Connecting networks does not come without costs, and a decision to interconnect requires careful consideration of the benefits compared to the costs incurred to connect at each location. The two common options for interconnection are either through a private bilateral arrangement between two networks using a dedicated physical connection (called a “direct interconnection”), or a multilateral arrangement where all networks connect into a public Internet Exchange switch. An Internet Exchange is a service that uses a switch infrastructure (sometimes referred to as a switch fabric or peering exchange) to provide connectivity between multiple networks. Interconnection methods are constantly evolving, and one of the more important developments in interconnection is the use of content delivery networks (CDNs). CDNs provide a more efficient means of distributing content by placing content and applications on servers distributed closer to, and sometimes within, the destination network – essentially bringing data (e.g., popular content) closer to the requestor instead of delivering the data across a potentially significant portion of the Internet. The introduction of CDNs and IXs has contributed to the “flattening” of the historic hierarchical model of Internet interconnection. Internet traffic has grown rapidly since the Internet’s inception, and this has often been driven by the growth of popular applications. Managing the exchange of Internet traffic between networks is accomplished primarily through the use of an inter-network routing protocol called the Boarder Gateway Protocol (BGP). BGP offers network administrators the ability to implement routing policy, or in other words how traffic flows through a network. BGP’s design offers limited support for inbound (traffic destined into one’s network) traffic control. Peering connections are increasingly the primary interconnection paths between networks, supplanting the model of hierarchical interconnection via a small group of long-distance network providers.  In most cases, two parties seeking to interconnect are able to come to terms. In some cases after an agreement is reached, however, traffic volumes or other factors may change, which in rare cases may lead to “de-peering” events if the changes are significant enough. More commonly, such changes lead to a renegotiation of the manner or type of interconnection agreement between the two parties. Although peering disputes over traffic imbalances, and other reasons, are not new, peering disputes in the U.S. have been increasingly publicized in recent years. In some cases traffic can flow contrary to the intentions of network operators, either in error or due to malicious activity. There are a number of important security considerations when connecting two networks. There are numerous types of attacks, as well as various motivations that may drive attackers. There are also a number of potential mitigations, as well as efforts to make routing more secure through new routing protocol extensions, notably RPKI and BGPSec. This report provides a reference on the subject of Internet interconnection, and presents a detailed review on how networks connect, the development and changes in connection models, motivations for connection, how networks manage traffic between each other and some of the challenges that arise as networks evolve.执行摘要：“互联”一词指的是网络提供商之间相互连接和传输流量的各种方式，是一套允许独立管理的网络为此目的相互连接的业务实践和技术机制。互联网互联不存在中央管理机构——整个系统的形成源于各方参与者作出的众多双边和多边互联决策。与电话系统在高度监管环境下实现互联不同，（全球大多数地区的）互联网互联仍属于私营领域事务。随着互联网生态持续演进，网络互联议题正受到日益广泛的关注。各类网络——包括互联网接入服务商、内容提供商、学术机构和商业企业的网络——都在进行相互连接。互联网连通性是通过将称为数据包的信息片段，从联网设备经由一个或多个网络运营商管理的路由器等网络设备传递，直至送达目标地址来实现的。因此，互联机制兼具技术和商业双重属性，关于互联技术的讨论必然会在某种程度上涉及商业问题——因为许多机制只有在商业语境中才能被充分理解。自互联网早期阶段以来，美国的网络互联已发生显著演变，如今已成为融合新型连接选项、交付方式、流量管理需求和商业实践的复杂混合体。需要特别注意两种主要互联形式的区别：（1）转接——付费获取通往互联网上所有公开可达目的地的接入；（2）对等互联——两个网络相互交换客户流量，且仅提供对方网络及其客户的接入。此外，对等互联既可能存在”无结算”（无需付费）安排，也可能存在付费安排。网络运营商出于业务和技术等多重考量开展对等互联。每家运营商都会制定评估互联对象的技术和运营标准，其中许多要求已在网上公开披露。建立网络连接必然产生成本，决策互联时需审慎权衡各连接点的收益与成本。常见的互联方式有两种：通过专用物理连接建立两个网络间的私有双边安排（称为”直接互联”），或通过公共互联网交换交换机实现多边互联。互联网交换服务利用交换机基础设施（有时称为交换矩阵或对等交换）为多网络间提供连通性。互联方式持续演进，其中内容分发网络（CDN）的应用是重要进展之一。CDN通过将内容和应用程序部署在更靠近（有时直接嵌入）目标网络的服务器上，实现了更高效的内容分发——本质上是将数据（如热门内容）推近请求方，而非跨越互联网长距离传输。CDN和互联网交换中心的出现促进了传统互联网分层互联结构的”扁平化”。自互联网诞生以来，流量增长始终受热门应用驱动呈现迅猛态势。网络间流量交换管理主要通过边界网关协议（BGP）这一互联网络路由协议实现。BGP赋予网络管理员实施路由策略的能力，即控制流量在网络中的传输路径。该协议设计对入站流量（目的地为本网络的流量）的控制支持较为有限。对等连接正逐步取代通过少数长途网络提供商进行分层互联的传统模式，成为网络间主要互联路径。多数情况下，寻求互联的双方能达成协议。但协议达成后，流量规模等因素变化可能引发罕见”断联”事件（当变化足够显著时），更常见的是促使双方重新协商互联方式或协议类型。尽管流量失衡等因素引发的对等争议并非新现象，但近年来美国此类争议的公开化程度明显提升。某些情况下，流量可能因错误配置或恶意活动偏离运营商的预期路径。网络互联需重视多项安全考量，包括各类攻击手段和动机，以及通过RPKI、BGPSec等新路由协议扩展增强路由安全性的防护措施。本报告系统梳理互联网互联主题，详细阐述网络连接方式、连接模式的演变历程、互联动因、网络间流量管理机制，以及网络发展过程中面临的挑战。资源链接: Interconnection and Traffic Exchange on the Internet",

        "content": "The invited plenary keynote presentation addressed to a national group of senior Fortune 100 practice leaders including Chief Security Officers focuses on emerging trends in Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). The keynote builds upon author’s recent Financial Risk Management practice leadership for Wall Street investment banks and recent Cyber Risk Management research conducted with oversight of a committee of distinguished scientists affiliated with Air Force Research Lab, NYS Cyber Research Institute, and State University of New York. The keynote elucidates the Cyber-Finance-Trust TM Framework developed to facilitate applied intuition about how ongoing digitization, virtualization, and transformation of inter- and intra-enterprise networks are contributing to the convergence of Financial Risk Management and Cyber Risk Management. It helps senior executives better understand the emergence of Cyber-Finance Risk Management that is anticipated to subsume most traditional risks generally treated in isolation such as various Financial Risks and Operational Risks. Based on a comprehensive review of most recent Cyber Security and Risk Management trends in two key sectors – Banking &amp; Finance, and, Healthcare –  it facilitates understanding about latest vulnerabilities, threats, and risk assessment and risk mitigation strategies. Advancing beyond computational quantitative analytical risk assessment models found deficient during the global financial crisis, it helps better understand the key role of the ‘human factor’ while relating it to coherent People, Process, and Technology frameworks underlying ERM. To facilitate more precise and accurate Risk Assessment and Risk Modeling for Cyber-Finance Risk Management, the concluding section provides an overview of author’s related research that developed robust foundations for Cyber Risk Insurance (CRI) Modeling. Advancing upon research and practice in CRI Modeling, to help prepare the senior executives responsible for Risk Management and Cybersecurity, the presentation delineates the computational quantitative analytical risk assessment models suitable for catastrophic risks  assessment which are increasingly material to ongoing viability and sustenance of any enterprise.受邀向包括首席安全官在内的《财富》100强企业资深实践领袖组成的国家团体发表的主旨演讲，聚焦企业风险管理（ERM）的新兴趋势。该演讲基于作者近期为华尔街投行提供的金融风险管理实践领导经验，以及在美国空军研究实验室、纽约州网络安全研究机构和纽约州立大学杰出科学家委员会监督下开展的网络安全风险管理研究。演讲阐述了”网络-金融-信任™框架”的开发成果，该框架旨在帮助人们直观理解企业间及企业内部网络持续数字化、虚拟化和转型如何推动金融风险管理与网络安全风险管理的融合。该框架协助高管更清晰地认识”网络金融风险管理”的兴起——这一新兴领域预计将涵盖多数传统上被孤立处理的风险（如各类金融风险与运营风险）。通过对银行金融业和医疗保健两大关键领域最新网络安全与风险管理趋势的全面梳理，演讲深入剖析了最新漏洞、威胁、风险评估及风险缓释策略。演讲突破全球金融危机中暴露缺陷的计算量化分析风险评估模型局限，通过将”人为因素”与ERM核心的人、流程、技术框架相关联，深化了对此关键要素的理解。为提升网络金融风险管理的评估与建模精度，结尾部分概述了作者为网络风险保险（CRI）建模奠定坚实基础的相关研究。基于CRI建模的研究与实践进展，本演讲为负责风险管理与网络安全的高管量身定制，详细阐释了适用于巨灾风险评估的计算量化分析模型——这类评估对任何企业的持续生存发展正变得日益关键。资源链接: Cybersecurity &amp; Cyber-FinanceRiskManagement: Strategies, Tactics, Operations, &amp;, Intelligence: EnterpriseRiskManagementto ModelRiskManagement: Understanding Vulnerabilities, Threats, &amp;RiskMitigation (Presentation Slides)",

        "content": "The world’s economy did not suffer de-globalisation after the 2008-2009 Global Crisis, but entered a phase of “New Normal”. While trade-income elasticity has been returning to its pre-1990s long-term values, the world is much more open to trade today than it was 25 years ago.  We show that part of the slowdown in trade can be attributed to a reduction in the rate of convergence between developed and developing countries, after a phase of high growth differential from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s. The rise of global value chains was another factor that contributed to this phenomenon, itself linked to a significant reduction in trade frictions in the 1990s, explained both by technological innovations and by important trade agreements. On the other hand, with the rise of income, household consumption of services such as housing, health and education increases more rapidly than demand for goods. Most of these services are less tradable than merchandises and the trade-in-services frictions in a gravity model tend to be higher than for goods. Though in the long run, rising income will induce a shift in demand towards less trade-intensive services, there is still a long march ahead for many developing countries while trade costs remain quite sizeable. In the shorter term, the WTO Agreement on Trade Facilitation creates an opportunity for reducing those trade costs.全球经济在2008-2009年危机后并未出现逆全球化，而是进入了”新常态”阶段。虽然贸易收入弹性正逐渐回归1990年代前的长期水平，但当今世界贸易开放度仍远高于25年前。研究表明，贸易增速放缓部分源于1990年代中期至2000年代中期高速增长差异期结束后，发达国家与发展中国家收敛速率的下降。全球价值链的崛起是另一关键因素，这与1990年代技术创新和重大贸易协定共同推动的贸易摩擦显著降低密切相关。另一方面，随着收入增长，居民对住房、医疗、教育等服务消费的增速远超商品需求。这些服务大多比货物更难贸易，引力模型中的服务贸易摩擦通常也高于货物贸易。尽管长期来看收入增长将推动需求转向贸易密集度更低的服务领域，但对许多发展中国家而言，在贸易成本仍居高不下的情况下，这仍是漫长征途。短期来看，《WTO贸易便利化协定》为降低这些贸易成本提供了契机。资源链接: WorldTradeand Income Remain Exposed to Gravity",

        "content": "This paper analyses the relationship between regional trade integration and trade costs in services industries. The empirical analysis relies, on the one hand, on a dataset of theory-consistent bilateral trade costs calculated for 61 countries over the period 2000-2011 and, on the other hand, on an analysis of services commitments in 66 regional trade agreements to which these countries are parties. Despite the proliferation of services RTAs in the past decade, we do not find significantly lower bilateral trade costs among countries having signed such agreements.  Several possible explanations are discussed. First, the gaps in services trade data and the difficulty to account for all modes of supply could influence our results. Second, the nature of services trade liberalisation makes it difficult to discriminate between domestic and foreign service providers (thus not impacting the relative costs they face). Third, there is no clear evidence that countries signing services RTAs do intend to create actual preferences for companies in partner countries. Services RTAs are about preferential “bindings”. Regionalism in the case of services seems non-discriminatory and does not lead to trade preferences.本文分析了区域贸易一体化与服务行业贸易成本之间的关系。实证分析一方面基于2000-2011年间61个国家理论一致的双边贸易成本数据集，另一方面则通过分析这些国家参与的66个区域贸易协定中的服务承诺条款展开。尽管过去十年间服务类区域贸易协定激增，但我们并未发现签署此类协定的国家之间存在显著降低的双边贸易成本。研究探讨了若干可能原因：首先，服务贸易数据缺口及难以全面核算所有供应模式可能影响研究结果；其次，服务贸易自由化的特性导致难以区分国内外服务供应商（因而未改变其面临的相对成本）；第三，没有明确证据表明签署服务类区域贸易协定的国家确实有意为伙伴国企业创造实质性优惠。此类协定实质是关于优惠性”约束承诺”，服务领域的区域主义呈现非歧视性特征，并未形成贸易优惠效应。资源链接: RegionalTradeAgreements andTradeCosts in Services",

        "content": "Much of ERM consists of qualitative discussion of the risks facing a business and controls over them. It is difficult to identify in the literature a clear body of theory to provide the foundation for the subject, integrating a business’s objectives with its risk controls. The present paper attempts this by formulation of ERM as an exercise in stochastic optimal control theory. Here there is a defined objective, which would usually include some aspect of profit, and a set of constraints (the risk controls). Optimal control theory provides a framework for balancing the one against the other, and also for considering whether or not particular risk controls are well advised. The paper accepts the COSO (2004) definition of ERM, and its associated ERM Integrated Framework. After definitions, preliminary discussion and establishment of the control theory set-up, the paper is organised with one section for each item of the ERM Integrated Framework. Each of these sections interprets that item within the control theory model. Risk controls may improve business performance, but they usually come at a cost. And the stronger the control, the greater may be the improvement, but the greater the cost. The essential purpose of the control theoretic formulation is the identification of the optimal strength of each risk control as that at which, for marginal further strengthening, the marginal improvement of business function is matched by marginal cost.企业风险管理（ERM）很大程度上包含对企业面临风险及其管控措施的定性讨论。现有文献中很难找到一个明确的理论体系，将企业目标与风险控制相结合，从而为该学科奠定基础。本文试图通过将ERM构建为随机最优控制理论的实践来解决这一问题。该理论设定了一个明确目标（通常包含利润要素）和一组约束条件（风险控制措施）。最优控制理论提供了平衡二者关系的框架，同时也能评估特定风险控制措施是否合理。本文采用COSO（2004）对ERM的定义及其配套的《ERM整合框架》。在完成定义、初步讨论和控制理论框架搭建后，论文按照《ERM整合框架》的各个要素分章节展开，每章节均在控制理论模型下解读相应要素。风险控制可能提升企业绩效，但往往伴随成本。控制力度越强，绩效提升可能越大，相应成本也越高。控制理论框架的核心目标在于确定每个风险控制措施的最优强度——即当控制力度边际增强时，业务功能边际改善与控制边际成本达到平衡的临界点。资源链接: ERM in an OptimalControlFramework",

        "content": "This paper examines the role played by internal control and its five components (i.e., control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring) in alleviating future stock price crash risk. Using a unique dataset from China, we find evidence that internal control is negatively associated with future stock price crash risk. Specifically, control environment and monitoring are significantly and negatively associated with future stock price crash risk. Moreover, the negative association between internal control and crash risk is significantly more pronounced in firms with weak internal and external governance (i.e., audited by non-Big 4 auditors, located in provinces with low market development, and less conservative in accounting) and with poor ability to mitigate impacts of extreme negative events (i.e., non-state-owned enterprises). Our study highlights the delicate role of internal control as a mechanism in preventing crash of stock price.本文探讨了内部控制及其五大要素（即控制环境、风险评估、控制活动、信息与沟通、监督）在缓解未来股价崩盘风险中的作用。基于中国独特数据集，我们发现内部控制与未来股价崩盘风险呈负相关。具体而言，控制环境和监督要素与未来股价崩盘风险存在显著负向关联。此外，在内外治理薄弱（即非四大审计、市场发展水平较低地区、会计政策较不保守）及极端负面事件应对能力较差（即非国有企业）的企业中，内部控制与崩盘风险的负向关联更为显著。本研究揭示了内部控制作为防范股价崩盘机制的精妙作用。资源链接: InternalControland Stock Price CrashRisk: Evidence from China",

        "content": "Concern over an organization’s reputation is at a heightened level and has become a top strategic business risk. Reputation creation, enhancement, and protection are critical to an organization’s success, yet highly challenging given the wide ranging and somewhat opaque nature of the concept as well as the variety of potential events causing harm. These qualities call for a strong enterprise risk management (ERM) approach to reputation that is holistic and integrative, yet existing knowledge of how to do so is limited. The aim of this paper is to evaluate and synthesize existing reputation literature in developing an enterprise-wide reputation risk management framework incorporating necessary steps, processes, and considerations. We address risk strategy, risk assessment, risk governance, and risk culture as key elements of ERM and conclude with suggestions for future research.对企业声誉的关注已达到前所未有的高度，并成为首要战略商业风险。声誉的建立、提升和保护对组织成功至关重要，但由于这一概念的广泛性和一定模糊性，以及可能造成损害的各类潜在事件，实现这些目标极具挑战性。这些特性要求采用全面且综合的强健企业风险管理（ERM）方法来应对声誉风险，然而现有相关实践知识仍显不足。本文旨在通过评估整合现有声誉文献，构建一个涵盖必要步骤、流程和考量的全企业声誉风险管理框架。我们将风险战略、风险评估、风险治理和风险文化作为企业风险管理的核心要素进行探讨，并最终提出未来研究方向建议。资源链接: Supporting Strategic Success Through Enterprise-Wide ReputationRiskManagement",

Thus, we propose a novel, feedback-based approach to examine risk management decisions. We simulate individuals’ decisions over 50 time periods and analyze how distributional properties of different risk management instruments influence subjects’ propensity to invest in self-insurance or self-protection. Our results show that subjects act more risk averse over time because self-insurance take-up rates increase when learners gain more experience. Individuals’ risk management decisions are price-sensitive but we find only limited evidence for a complementary relationship between both risk management options. Our findings provide an alternative explanation for the low demand for risk management investments against low probability risks and can be used to predict developments in new insurance markets with inexperienced policyholders.由于缺乏关于风险管理活动有效性的描述性信息，决策者往往不得不依赖（自身）对这些投资的既往经验。为此，我们提出了一种基于反馈的新方法来检验风险管理决策。我们模拟了50个时间段内个体的决策，分析不同风险管理工具的分佈特性如何影响受试者对自我保险或自我保护的投入倾向。结果显示，随着学习者经验积累，自我保险的采纳率上升，受试者会随时间推移表现出更强的风险规避倾向。个体的风险管理决策对价格敏感，但我们仅发现有限证据表明两种风险管理选项存在互补关系。这些发现为低概率风险领域风险管理投资需求低迷现象提供了另一种解释，并可用于预测由缺乏经验的投保人构成的新保险市场发展趋势。资源链接: Learning andRiskManagementDecisions",

        "content": "Although Vietnam has been an official member of WTO since 2007, non-tariff measures such as Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) measures in WTO agreements are not familiar to many corporate or governmental entities. Therefore, TBT and SPS measures are not consistently implemented and the advantages of such agreements are not realized. It was determined that international policy learning, searching international experience for transferable ‘best practice’ and identifying common trends and pressures that affect other systems, would be an avenue toward amending domestic policy to facilitate compliance with TBT and SPS agreements.Given that the plastics and agricultural industries are fast emerging markets of particular importance to Vietnam’s economy, they were chosen as the focus of our study. Two other Southeast Asian countries, Malaysia and Thailand were selected for our policy learning study. Historical to date trade data with country specific policy development trends and strategies were collected and processed. Local experts in Malaysia, Thailand and WTO were consulted. It was discovered that the plastics industry is not an industry with a long history of development in Malaysia but which is one of the most important export products of Malaysia. Thailand is a leading agricultural products exporter even to markets which set up strict TBT and/or SPS measures. Export value, product structure and export market structure were all analyzed. Results suggest that the achievements of Malaysia and Thailand area attributable to well-engineered Government policy, as well as corporate compliance with TBT and SPS measures in both countries. In order to determine how the products of this study might reasonably inform domestic policy and industry practice a better knowledge of the current state of the industries with regard to implementation of TBT and SPS measures was required. Questionnaires were submitted to traders, producers and industry associations in Vietnam to document SPS and TBT agreements compliance practices. Results of the questionnaire illustrate how and to what extent lessons garnered from the policy learning study can be successfully employed in Vietnam.尽管越南自2007年已成为世贸组织正式成员，但许多企业或政府机构对WTO协议中的技术性贸易壁垒（TBT）和卫生与植物检疫措施（SPS）仍不熟悉。因此，TBT和SPS措施未能得到连贯实施，相关协议的优势也未能充分体现。研究表明，通过国际政策学习、借鉴可移植的”最佳实践”国际经验，并识别影响其他体系的共同趋势与压力，可作为修订国内政策以促进TBT和SPS协议合规的有效途径。鉴于塑料和农业是越南经济中快速崛起的重要产业，本研究选定这两个领域作为重点。我们选取马来西亚和泰国这两个东南亚国家进行政策学习研究，收集并处理了历史贸易数据及各国政策发展趋势与战略，同时咨询了马来西亚、泰国及WTO的本地专家。研究发现：塑料产业虽非马来西亚的传统支柱产业，却已成为该国最重要的出口产品之一；泰国则是农产品出口强国，其产品甚至能进入设立严格TBT/SPS措施的市场。通过分析出口价值、产品结构和出口市场结构，结果显示马泰两国的成就源于政府精心设计的政策及企业对TBT/SPS措施的合规实践。为评估本研究结果对越南国内政策与行业实践的指导价值，需深入了解当前产业执行TBT/SPS措施的现状。我们向越南贸易商、生产商及行业协会发放问卷，记录其SPS/TBT协议合规实践。问卷结果揭示了政策学习经验在越南应用的可行性及实施路径。资源链接: Implementation of SPS/TBT Agreements - Experiences from Other Countries and Lessons for Vietnam",

        "content": "In last decades, international trade has been characterized worldwide by a significant opening up, mainly based on the reduction of tariffs. However, simultaneously there has been an increase in non tariff measures (NTMs) notified to the WTO. Within this category they are technical barriers to trade (TBT) and sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS). The increasing importance of these requirements highlights the need to attend to the effects that SPS/TBT measures have on the flow of imports and exports. In order to address this matter, a literature review was made to consider the latest research in the field specifically in the case of food and agricultural sector. Finally, as an overall result the existence of a “dual” effect was shown regarding the relationship between SPS/TBT and food and agricultural international trade which depends on the trade-off between implementation costs and the benefits of a better positioning in an gradually more demanding market.过去几十年间，全球国际贸易呈现出显著开放的特征，这主要得益于关税的降低。然而与此同时，向世界贸易组织(WTO)通报的非关税措施(NTMs)却有所增加，其中技术性贸易壁垒(TBT)和卫生与植物检疫措施(SPS)尤为突出。这些要求日益凸显的重要性，使得关注SPS/TBT措施对进出口流量的影响变得必要。为此，本文通过文献综述探讨了该领域的最新研究，特别是针对食品和农业部门的研究。最终总体结果表明：SPS/TBT与食品及农产品国际贸易之间存在”双重”效应，这种效应取决于实施成本与在日益严苛市场中获取更有利地位所带来的收益之间的权衡。资源链接: Assessing the Impact of Sanitary, Phytosanitary andTechnicalRequirements on Food and AgriculturalTrade: What Does Current Research Tell Us?",

        "content": "This paper presents a theory on how firm structure responds to market competitiveness. Firms have often been observed to reallocate control rights, sometimes in response to market competition. We develop a theory on the dependence of firm structure on market competition using an incomplete contract approach. We show that a reallocation of control rights can be an effective way of adapting to changing market competitiveness. We find that when market competitiveness changes, depending on demand elasticity, firms may centralize or decentralize control rights to encourage work incentives or to control risk. We present a few case studies in support of this result. We also investigate the effect of changing demand elasticity and production cost on firm structure, as well as the effect of market competition on efficiency, incentives and risk control after taking into account the endogenous, competition-driven firm structure.本文提出了一种关于企业结构如何响应市场竞争力的理论。我们经常观察到企业会重新分配控制权，有时是为了应对市场竞争。我们运用不完全契约方法，构建了一个关于企业结构依赖于市场竞争的理论。研究表明，控制权的重新分配可以成为适应市场竞争环境变化的有效方式。我们发现当市场竞争力发生变化时，根据需求弹性差异，企业可能通过集权或分权来激励工作积极性或控制风险。文中提供了若干支持这一结论的案例研究。我们还探讨了需求弹性和生产成本变化对企业结构的影响，以及在考虑内生性、竞争驱动的企业结构后，市场竞争对效率、激励和风险控制的作用。资源链接: Adaptive Firm Structure under Market Competition: Efficiency, Incentives, andRiskControl",

        "content": "Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS) require auditors to evaluate internal control and assess control risk when performing an audit. Among the factors to be considered are the control environment, control activities, management’s attitude’s toward internal control, and culture.  Research on how, or whether, culture influences auditors’ evaluation of internal control and assessment of control risk is lacking in the literature. The purpose of this study is to serve as a first step in determining whether culture influences auditors’ evaluation of internal control and assessment of control risk and if so, how. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on a non-random sample of 200 CPAs in the U.S. to determine whether there are differences in auditors’ evaluation of internal control and assessment of control risk in different cultures. Using Hofstede’s cultural dimensions (individualism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance and masculinity), the results of the study indicate that auditors evaluate internal control and assess control risk significantly different for companies that operate in countries that are on opposite ends of the cultural continuum as measured by Hofstede’s dimensions. The results of the test suggest that for internal control there is a “culture risk” at work, that can be defined as the risk that an entity’s internal control maybe be less (more) effective, with a higher (lower) degree of control risk, purely as a function of the culture in which the entity operates. Auditors assess control risk higher for companies operating in countries with a low individualism score, a high power distance score, and a low uncertainty avoidance score. They also evaluate total internal control as less effective in countries with a low individualism score, a high power distance score, a low masculinity score and a low uncertainty avoidance score. Areas for future research are suggested.《公认审计准则》(GAAS)要求审计师在执行审计时评估内部控制并判断控制风险。需考量的因素包括控制环境、控制活动、管理层对内部控制的态度以及文化因素。现有文献缺乏关于文化如何（或是否）影响审计师对内部控制的评估及控制风险判断的研究。本研究旨在初步探讨文化是否会影响审计师对内部控制的评估及控制风险判断，若存在影响，则进一步分析其作用机制。. . 通过对美国200名注册会计师的非随机样本进行方差分析(ANOVA)，本研究检验了不同文化背景下审计师对内部控制评估及控制风险判断的差异性。基于霍夫斯泰德文化维度理论（个人主义、权力距离、不确定性规避和男性气质），研究结果显示：对于处于霍夫斯泰德文化维度两极的国家运营的企业，审计师对其内部控制的评估和控制风险的判断存在显著差异。测试结果表明，在内部控制领域存在”文化风险”——即实体内部控制的有效性可能降低（或提升），控制风险水平可能增高（或降低），这纯粹取决于该实体所处的文化环境。. . 研究发现：对于在低个人主义、高权力距离和低不确定性规避文化国家运营的企业，审计师会判定其控制风险更高；同时在低个人主义、高权力距离、低男性气质和低不确定性规避文化国家，审计师对整体内部控制有效性的评价更低。文末提出了未来研究的建议方向。资源链接: CultureRisk: An Exploratory Study of the Influence of Culture on Auditors’ Evaluation of InternalControland Assessment ofControlRisk",

Our analysis covers 10,568 internal ratings for 3,661 small business clients at six retail banks.

        "content": "Background: This body of work represents the first thesis to advance Finance Quantitative Methods, Quantitative Finance and Fintech Modeling R&amp;D to the AI-ML-Quant-Cyber-Crypto-Quantum-Risk-Computing Era. The Current Post-Doctoral Research Thesis On Finance, Quant, and Risk Modeling beyond the Global Financial Crisis is based upon synthesizing post-crisis Quantitative Finance, Computer Science, Network &amp; Computer Security Engineering R&amp;D. It proposes pioneering Crypto-era Cyber-Finance-Trust Engineering frameworks advancing upon the first Digital Transformation Social Networks Quant Modeling PhD thesis that pioneered post-WWW Digital Quant-IT-Finance-Controls-Risks, Decentralized Control Models, and, Digital-Social Knowledge-Assets R&amp;D.PrefaceComing from an Engineering background as a Chartered Engineer, I led global Banking &amp; Finance modeling and development projects for largest US and worldwide banks. I also led modeling and implementation projects for the Big-3 IT firm on which hundreds of global Banking &amp; Finance firms relied as a key global financial systems provider. Then, I earned a quantitative PhD with 2xPhD Credits from Top-10 PhD Program and subsequently taught as Associate Professor and Assistant Professor of Quantitative Methods at Syracuse University with research focus on quantitative risk modeling. Just before the Global Financial Crisis, my research was surfacing critical questions about the model risk inherent in Financial Engineering models. For instance, I made reference to it in an interview by a UK based global management research publisher in 2005.Those questions were about the compatibility of deterministic and stochastic models of natural sciences with the increasingly non-deterministic, i.e., uncertain, sociotechnical post-WWW digitally social networked world. Those questions were also about the capacity of deterministic and stochastic Financial Engineering risk models to cope with increasing uncertainty characterizing a rapidly and dynamically changing digital world. Those questions led me to post-doctoral research in Quantitative Finance leading to working for top Wall Street investment banks such as JP Morgan Private Bank in midtown Manhattan. My technical and applied hands-on leadership guiding JP Morgan top executives and MDs focused on advancing their advanced Quantitative Finance risk modeling and analytics. I focused on guiding their financial risk modeling beyond quantitative models that had become targets of criticism given association with large-scale financial failures over the span of the Global Financial Crisis.After concluding those Quantitative Finance projects, I continued to further advance related post-doc research in Computational Finance and Cybersecurity. While conducting research on rapidly increasing Cyber risk in Banking and Finance domains with emergency warnings coming from the White House, US Treasury, Department of Homeland Security, and, Office of Comptroller of Currency, this thesis was born. It was born out of the observation about the specific risk models blamed for the Global Financial Crisis which nearly drove US investment banks to extinction. The same models were now becoming the predominant models of choice by commercial providers for cyber risk and cyber insurance related modeling for estimation of potential cyber risk related financial loss….AbstractQuantitative modeling of cyber risk for cyber insurance modeling is at a nascent stage characterized by sparse empirical research and reliable data. Our current investigation reveals that VaR, short for Value-at-Risk (Jorion, 2006), is the current predominant model of choice for cyber insurance modeling. Model risk related to VaR was a key factor in the Global Financial Crisis given its known limitations in modeling tail risks and systemic risks (Haldane &amp; Nelson, 2012; Malhotra, 2012, 20141). As a result, US Federal Reserve and OCC issued model risk compliance guidance for US financial institutions (US Fed &amp; OCC, 2011). Basel Committee of worldwide central bank supervisors stopped relying on VaR for risk modeling (BCBS, 2013). Given history of model risks associated with VaR, we investigate if current reliance of cyber insurance modeling on VaR entails model risk. We develop qualitative frameworks to benchmark relative levels of tail risks and systemic risks associated with cyber risk vis-à-vis financial risks typically modeled with VaR. Our analysis reveals that cyber risk entails exponentially higher tail risks and systemic risks thus making VaR unfit for reliance as the primary risk model for cyber insurance modeling. We develop specific frameworks of model risk management (Derman, 1996; Morini, 2011) for cyber insurance modeling and demonstrate their empirical application in model risk management. We distinguish between model risks arising from the choice of specific quantitative models from those arising from the choice of quantitative methodologies. We demonstrate how to manage model risks associated with VaR using it with multiple simple and advanced models to cross-check its reliability. We also offer alternative coherent risk measures as better alternatives to VaR and empirically demonstrate their application. To enable further minimization of model risk in cyber insurance modeling we do three more things. First, we analyze the Bayesian quantitative statistical inference methodology as a possible alternative to frequentist classical inference methodology that VaR and advanced models typically rely upon. Second, we analyze the Markov Chain Monte Carlo models and related Gibbs Sampling and Metropolis-Hastings statistical computing algorithms to enable the use of Bayesian methodology. Finally, given increasing uncertainty in cyber risk modeling and management, we develop a framework for enabling Knightian uncertainty management (Knight, 1921) relating it to model risk management.ContributionsTo avert the impending national Cyber risk and Cyber-insurance disaster based upon large-scale commercial reliance upon quantitative models with inherent model risks, tail risks, and systemic risks in current form, this dissertation makes the following key contributions.▪ First, we develop the first known Cyber-Finance-Trust framework for Cyber insurance modeling to analyze how finance risk entangled with Cyber risk further exacerbates the systemic, interdependent, and correlated character of Cyber risks.▪ Second, we develop the first known model risk management framework for Cyber insurance modeling as model risk management has received sparse attention in Cyber risk assessment and Cyber insurance modeling.▪ Third, our review of quantitative models in Cyber risk and Cyber insurance modeling develops the first known analysis establishing significant and extreme model risks, tail risks, and, systemic risks related to predominant models in use.▪ Fourth, we develop an empirical study of VaR and Bayesian statistical inference methodologies with specific guidance for containing model risks by applying multiple simple and advanced models for cross-checking the reliability of VaR.▪ Fifth, we develop an analysis of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo Models, Gibbs Sampling and Metropolis-Hastings statistical computing algorithms for enabling Bayesian statistical inference methodologies to minimize model risk in Cyber risk and Cyber insurance risk modeling for the specific context of cybersecurity.▪ Sixth, we develop the first known portfolio theory based framework for Cyber insurance modeling with guidance to minimize model risks, tail risks, and systemic risks inherent in models in commercial Cyber insurance modeling.▪ Finally, given increasing role of uncertainty in cyber (and financial) risk modeling and management, we develop a framework for enabling Knightian uncertainty management relating it to model risk management.Understanding of the developed frameworks and technical models listed above should minimize model risk in the recommended applications based on above contributions.Updated, revised, summary version of the thesis invited for submission by NAIC as:National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Expert Paper: The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is the U.S. standard-setting and regulatory support organization created and governed by the chief insurance regulators from the 50 states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories.

The world’s two largest economic zones would be united in a trade and investment pact, which would generate new economic growth at a time when it was desperately needed. Negotiations began in July of that year, with promises that this negotiation would not drag on endlessly, as some other trade talks have. We are now just over one year into the process, with the sixth round of talks having just taken place July 14-18 in Brussels and the seventh round to be held from September 29 through October 3 in Washington. It is time for an evaluation of what has been achieved. Are the talks progressing as rapidly as hoped? Are the hurdles surmountable? Will this giant free-trade zone actually come to fruition? This bulletin examines the current state of the TTIP talks relative to expectations and in the larger context of the world trading system. It describes some of the main stumbling blocks that have arisen and makes suggestions for moving the process forward.2013年初，奥巴马总统在国情咨文演讲中高调宣布启动《跨大西洋贸易与投资伙伴关系协定》（TTIP）谈判。全球两大经济区将通过这项贸易投资协定实现联合，在亟需新增长动力的时期创造经济活力。谈判于当年7月启动，相关方承诺不会像其他贸易谈判那样无限期拖延。如今谈判已进行一年有余，第六轮会谈刚于7月14日至18日在布鲁塞尔结束，第七轮将于9月29日至10月3日在华盛顿举行。现在正是评估阶段性成果的时机：谈判是否如预期般顺利推进？障碍能否被克服？这个巨型自贸区能否真正建成？本期简报结合世界贸易体系大背景，对照预期目标审视TTIP谈判现状，剖析已出现的主要分歧点，并就推动谈判进程提出建议。资源链接: One Year into the TTIP Negotiations: Getting to Yes",

        "content": "In aftermath of the Financial Crisis, some risk management practitioners advocate wider adoption of Bayesian inference to replace Value-at-Risk (VaR) models for minimizing risk failures (Borison &amp; Hamm, 2010). They claim reliance of Bayesian inference on subjective judgment, the key limitation of Bayesian  methodology as underscored by statisticians (Kass &amp; Raftery, 1995; Kruschke, 2011; Lynch, 2007), as the most significant advantage compared with VaR (Christoffersen, 2012). Despite its well-known limitations, just like all other quantitative models (Derman, 1996; Morini, 2011), VaR – [mostly] non-Bayesian and [increasingly] Bayesian – continues to be a key methodological foundation of risk management and regulation related risk modeling practices in global Finance (Danielsson et al., 2014; Zangari, 1996). Bayesian inference modeling and VaR modeling frameworks are outlined to facilitate model risk management (Derman, 1996; Morini, 2011; US Fed &amp; OCC, 2011) for minimizing risk of any model – Bayesian, VaR, or Bayesian VaR. VaR frameworks are empirically applied for hedge fund risk modeling (Darbyshire &amp; Hampton, 2012, 2014) of a multi-asset fund of funds portfolio of a large Wall Street investment bank. Multiple risk models and measures with transparent assumptions to cross-validate convergent findings across multiple levels of risk analysis are examined for empirical model risk management.Journal granted non-exclusive copyright to publish the article: Author retains all copyrights:Malhotra, Yogesh.

To rectify this gap, this chapter explores two important ERM issues applicable to SMEs. First, we examine the integration of ERM principles in the operations of SMEs, specifically including the implementation of legal risk management, and describe the structural and attitudinal factors that hinder its effectiveness. Second, we examine ERM-oriented corporate governance regulations, and consider their potential usefulness to SMEs. Drawing from our analysis of these two issues, we suggest ways in which SMEs can more effectively implement and use ERM.尽管近年来企业风险管理（ERM）已成为公司治理领域关注的重点，但中小型企业（SMEs）实施ERM的情况却较少受到立法者和监管机构的重视。为弥补这一不足，本章探讨了适用于中小型企业的两个重要ERM议题。首先，我们研究了ERM原则在中小企业运营中的整合问题，特别包括法律风险管理的实施，并分析了阻碍其有效性的结构性和观念性因素。其次，我们考察了以ERM为导向的公司治理法规，并评估其对中小企业的潜在价值。基于对这两个议题的分析，我们提出了中小企业更有效实施和运用ERM的建议。资源链接: Legal and Regulatory Aspects of EnterpriseRiskManagementfor Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises",

        "content": "Within the discipline of enterprise risk management (ERM), strategic risk management (SRM) has become a subject of increasing interest to practitioners and academics.   To our knowledge, the term “strategic risk management” first appeared in the management literature in 1985 and 1986 (Jammine, 1985; Figenbaum &amp; Thomas, 1986) and in the academic finance literature in 1990 (Rawls  and Smithson, 1990), although early usage of the term did not clearly relate to later conceptions.  The phrase has been in use even longer than ERM (Bromiley, McShane, Nair, and Rustambekov, 2014).  Even with this longevity, the meaning of the term remains unclear, with confusion increasing with the advent of ERM.  For example, does SRM mean the management of a specific category of risks known as “strategic risks” (AICPCU, 2013) or does SRM mean strategic actions/responses taken to mitigate major uncertainties facing the enterprise? Can any type of risk potentially become a strategic risk, or are only certain types of risk strategic?  Is SRM a separate type of risk management or a subset of ERM?在企业风险管理（ERM）学科中，战略风险管理（SRM）日益成为从业者和学者关注的课题。据我们所知，“战略风险管理”一词最早出现在1985年和1986年的管理文献中（Jammine, 1985; Figenbaum &amp; Thomas, 1986），以及1990年的金融学术文献中（Rawls and Smithson, 1990），尽管早期的使用与后来的概念并无明确关联。该术语的使用历史甚至比ERM更久远（Bromiley, McShane, Nair, and Rustambekov, 2014）。尽管如此，该术语的含义仍不明确，随着ERM的出现，混淆进一步加剧。例如，SRM是指对被称为“战略风险”的特定风险类别的管理（AICPCU, 2013），还是指为减轻企业面临的主要不确定性而采取的战略行动/应对措施？任何类型的风险是否都有可能成为战略风险，还是只有某些特定类型的风险属于战略风险？SRM是一种独立的风险管理类型，还是ERM的一个子集？资源链接: Can StrategicRiskManagementContribute to EnterpriseRiskManagement?

        "content": "We estimate the effects of trade facilitation on extensive margins of trade. Using OECD Trade Facilitation Indicators – which closely reflect the Trade Facilitation Agreement negotiated at the Bali WTO Ministerial Conference of December 2013 – we show that trade facilitation in a given exporting country is positively correlated with the number of products exported by destination and with the number of export destinations served by product. To address the issue of causality, we employ an identification strategy whereby only exports of new products, or exports to new destinations, are taken into account when computing the respective margins of trade. Our findings therefore imply a positive causal impact of trade facilitation on the country-level extensive margins of trade. The results are, to a large extent, robust to alternative definitions of country-level trade margins, to different sets of controls variables and to various estimation methods. Simulating the effect of an increase to the regional or global median values of trade facilitation, we are able to quantify the potential extensive margin gains of trade facilitation reform in different regions.我们评估了贸易便利化对贸易扩展边际的影响。利用经合组织贸易便利化指标（该指标紧密反映了2013年12月巴厘岛世贸组织部长级会议达成的《贸易便利化协定》），我们证明出口国的贸易便利化水平与按目的地划分的出口产品数量、以及按产品划分的出口目的地数量均呈正相关。为解决因果关系问题，我们采用了一种识别策略——在计算相应贸易边际时，仅考虑新产品的出口或对新目的地的出口。因此，研究结果表明贸易便利化对国家层面贸易扩展边际具有积极的因果效应。这些结论在采用不同的国家层面贸易边际定义、不同的控制变量组合以及多种估计方法时，均表现出较强的稳健性。通过模拟将贸易便利化水平提升至区域或全球中位值的效果，我们量化了不同地区实施贸易便利化改革可能带来的扩展边际收益。资源链接: A New Look at the ExtensiveTradeMargin Effects ofTradeFacilitation",

        "content": "This paper investigates the connection between technical standards, ICT industries, and international trade law to demonstrate how standards can be used as potential barriers to trade. There has been less attention paid to the role of standards as a form of protectionism, despite the introduction of Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (‘TBT Agreement’) on 15 April 1994. Stated as an objective, the TBT Agreement is to ensure that no unnecessary obstacles to international trade are created. While governments in the past have relied upon high tariffs and quotas imposed on imports to protect local industries or discriminate against foreign-produced goods, less transparent measures – referred to as non-tariff barriers – are now becoming more prominent. On one hand, it signals the growing significance of proprietary technologies in standards, demonstrating that public policy must embrace these concerns, but on the other hand, the continued tensions between two significant trading partners – China and the United States – demonstrates the complexity of international trade law in this area.本文探讨技术标准、信息通信技术产业与国际贸易法之间的联系，以论证标准如何可能成为贸易壁垒。尽管《技术性贸易壁垒协定》（简称《TBT协定》）已于1994年4月15日生效，但标准作为保护主义手段的作用仍未受到足够重视。《TBT协定》旨在确保不构成对国际贸易不必要的障碍。过去政府依赖高关税和进口配额来保护本土产业或歧视外国产品，如今更不透明的非关税壁垒措施正日益凸显。一方面，这显示专有技术在标准中的重要性日益提升，表明公共政策必须关注这些问题；另一方面，中美两大贸易伙伴间持续紧张的关系，也凸显了该领域国际贸易法的复杂性。资源链接: Balancing Barriers toTradeandTechnicalStandards: Potential Impact on ICT Industries",

        "content": "Certain classes of system-level risk depend partly on decentralized lay decision making. For instance, an organization’s network security risk depends partly on its employees’ responses to phishing attacks. On a larger scale, the risk within a financial system depends partly on households’ responses to mortgage sales pitches. Behavioral economics shows that lay decision makers typically depart in systematic ways from the normative rationality of Expected Utility (EU), and instead display heuristics and biases as captured in the more descriptively accurate Prospect Theory (PT). In turn psychological studies show that successful deception ploys eschew direct logical argumentation and instead employ peripheral-route persuasion, manipulation of visceral emotions, urgency, and familiar contextual cues. The detection of phishing emails and inappropriate mortgage contracts may be framed as a binary classification task. Signal Detection Theory (SDT) offers the standard normative solution, formulated as an optimal cutoff threshold, for distinguishing between good/bad emails or mortgages. In this paper we extend SDT behaviorally by re-deriving the optimal cutoff threshold under PT. Furthermore we incorporate the psychology of deception into determination of SDT’s discriminability parameter. With the neo-additive probability weighting function, the optimal cutoff threshold under PT is rendered unique under well-behaved sampling distributions, tractable in computation, and transparent in interpretation. The PT-based cutoff threshold is (i) independent of loss aversion and (ii) more conservative than the classical SDT cutoff threshold. Independently of any possible misalignment between individual-level and system-level misclassification costs, decentralized behavioral decision makers are biased toward under-detection, and system-level risk is consequently greater than in analyses predicated upon normative rationality.某些系统级风险类别部分依赖于分散的非专业决策。例如，一个组织的网络安全风险部分取决于员工对钓鱼攻击的反应。更大范围内，金融体系的风险部分取决于家庭对抵押贷款推销的应对方式。行为经济学表明，非专业决策者通常会以系统性方式偏离期望效用理论（EU）的规范性理性，转而表现出启发式与偏见，这些特征在描述性更准确的前景理论（PT）中得以体现。心理学研究则显示，成功的欺骗手段会避开直接逻辑论证，转而采用外围路径说服、操纵本能情绪、制造紧迫感及利用熟悉情境线索。检测钓鱼邮件和不适当抵押合同可视为二元分类任务。信号检测理论（SDT）提供了标准规范性解决方案——通过最优截止阈值区分良性/恶意邮件或贷款。本文从行为角度拓展SDT，在PT框架下重新推导最优截止阈值，并将欺骗心理学融入SDT辨别力参数的确定过程。采用新可加概率加权函数时，PT下的最优截止阈值在良好抽样分布中具有唯一性、计算易处理性及解释透明性。基于PT的截止阈值具有两大特征：（1）与损失厌恶无关；（2）比经典SDT阈值更保守。即使不考虑个体层面与系统层面误判成本的潜在错配，分散的行为决策者也存在检测不足的倾向，因此系统风险会大于基于规范性理性的分析结果。资源链接: The Effect of Decentralized Behavioral Decision Making on System-LevelRisk",

        "content": "This chapter analyzes the characteristics of U.S. insurers for purposes of determining whether they are systemically risky.  More specifically, primary indicators and contributing factors associated with systemic risk are assessed for the insurance sector. A distinction is made between the core activities of insurers (e.g., underwriting, reserving, claims settlement, etc.) and their non-core activities (such as providing financial guarantees).  Statistical analysis of insurer characteristics and their relationship with a well-known systemic risk measure, SRISK, is provided. The core activities of property-casualty insurers are found not to be systemically risky.  However, we find evidence that some core activities of life insurers, particularly separate accounts and group annuities, may be associated with systemic risk. The non-core activities of both types of insurers can contribute to systemic risk. The study also finds that insurers may be susceptible to intra-sector crises such as reinsurance crises arising from counterparty credit risk. New and proposed state and federal regulations are reviewed in light of the potential for systemic risk for this sector.本章分析美国保险公司的特征，以判断其是否具有系统性风险。具体而言，评估了保险业与系统性风险相关的主要指标和影响因素。研究区分了保险公司的核心业务（如承保、准备金计提、理赔等）与非核心业务（如提供金融担保）。通过统计分析保险公司特征与知名系统性风险指标SRISK的关系，发现财产意外险公司的核心业务不存在系统性风险，但寿险公司的某些核心业务（特别是独立账户和团体年金）可能具有系统性风险。两类保险公司的非核心业务均可能引发系统性风险。研究还表明保险公司易受行业内部危机影响，例如由交易对手信用风险引发的再保险危机。基于该行业潜在的系统性风险，本章还审视了各州及联邦已实施和拟议的新监管措施。资源链接: SystemicRiskand Regulation of the U.S. Insurance Industry",

        "content": "Some of the largest global insurers are actively pursuing the recently enacted Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI). While the concept of sustainability is often associated with a governance design that promotes stakeholder value the PSI do not appear to be a call for stakeholder-focused insurers. Rather the PSI appear to be about internalizing tacit claims in the operations of insurers. Conceptual and empirical literature on shareholder value maximization suggests that when an insurer honors its tacit claims the value to shareholders increases. A key insight from practice is that a sincere pursuit of the PSI will expand the scope of corporate risk management.一些全球大型保险公司正在积极推行最新颁布的《可持续保险原则》。虽然可持续发展理念常与促进利益相关者价值的治理设计相关联，但该原则似乎并非呼吁保险公司以利益相关者为核心。相反，该原则更侧重于将隐性权益要求内化于保险公司的运营中。关于股东价值最大化的理论与实证研究表明，当保险公司履行其隐性权益时，股东价值将随之提升。实践中的关键启示在于：真诚贯彻该原则将拓宽企业风险管理的范畴。资源链接: A Perspective on the Principles for Sustainable Insurance:RiskManagementand Value",

        "content": "Expected Shortfall (ES) has been widely accepted as a risk measure that is conceptually superior to Value-at-Risk (VaR). At the same time, however, it has been criticised for issues relating to backtesting. In particular, ES has been found not to be elicitable which means that backtesting for ES is less straightforward than, e.g., backtesting for VaR. Expectiles have been suggested as potentially better alternatives to both ES and VaR. In this paper, we revisit commonly accepted desirable properties of risk measures like coherence, comonotonic additivity, robustness and elicitability. We check VaR, ES and Expectiles with regard to whether or not they enjoy these properties, with particular emphasis on Expectiles. We also consider their impact on capital allocation, an important issue in risk management. We find that, despite the caveats that apply to the estimation and backtesting of ES, it can be considered a good risk measure. As a consequence, there is no sufficient evidence to justify an all-inclusive replacement of ES by Expectiles in applications. For backtesting ES, we propose an empirical approach that consists in replacing ES by a set of four quantiles, which should allow to make use of backtesting methods for VaR.预期缺口（ES）作为一种风险度量指标，已被广泛认为在概念上优于风险价值（VaR）。然而与此同时，它也因与回测相关的问题而受到批评。特别是，ES被发现不具备可引出性，这意味着对ES进行回测不如对VaR进行回测那样直接。期望损失被提出作为ES和VaR的潜在更优替代方案。本文重新审视了风险度量普遍认可的理想特性，如一致性、共单调可加性、稳健性和可引出性。我们检验了VaR、ES和期望损失是否具备这些特性，尤其侧重于期望损失。我们还探讨了它们对资本配置的影响，这是风险管理中的一个重要问题。我们发现，尽管ES在估计和回测方面存在注意事项，它仍可被视为一种良好的风险度量。因此，没有足够证据支持在应用中全面用期望损失替代ES。针对ES的回测，我们提出了一种经验方法，即用四个分位数替代ES，这应能利用VaR的回测方法。资源链接: What is the BestRiskMeasure in Practice?

        "content": "This paper studies the effect of increased risk aversion on self-insurance and self-protection in a two-period expected utility framework in which the risk-reducing investment precedes its effect. In contrast to monoperiodic models, self-insurance and self-protection react very similarly to an increase in risk aversion, i.e., increased risk aversion is associated with more effort if and only if current consumption is sufficiently large. Only if savings are endogenized, the classical findings are recouped. Then, increased risk aversion leads to more self-insurance in any case, and increased risk aversion leads to more self-protection if and only if the loss probability is below an endogenous threshold, extending results obtained by Dionne and Eeckhoudt (1985).本文研究了在两期预期效用框架下，风险厌恶程度增加对自我保险和自我保护的影响，其中风险降低投资先于其效果发生。与单期模型不同，自我保险和自我保护对风险厌恶程度增加的反应非常相似，即只有当当前消费足够大时，风险厌恶程度增加才会与更多努力相关联。只有在储蓄被内生化的情形下，经典结论才能重现。此时，风险厌恶程度增加总会导致更多自我保险；而风险厌恶程度增加导致更多自我保护，当且仅当损失概率低于内生阈值，这扩展了Dionne和Eeckhoudt（1985）的研究成果。资源链接: Self-Insurance, Self-Protection and IncreasedRiskAversion: An Intertemporal Reinvestigation",

        "content": "We empirically investigate the impact of shareholders’ excess control rights (greater control than cash-flow rights) on bank profitability and risk before, during, and after the global financial crisis of 2007-2008. We use a unique hand-crafted dataset tracing the complete control chains of 788 European commercial banks and cover the 2002-2010 period. We find that the presence of excess control rights is associated with lower profitability, higher risk-taking and higher default risk before (2002-2006) and after (2009-2010) the crisis. Conversely, it improves profitability and no longer affects risk during the crisis (2007-2008). Further evidence shows that, regardless of the period, the effect of excess control rights on profitability and risk is accentuated in family-controlled banks and in countries with relatively weak shareholder protection rights and that such an effect is only effective at intermediate and high levels of excess control rights. Overall, our findings contribute to the literature examining the corporate governance determinants of banks’ performance during the 2007-2008 financial crisis and have several policy implications.我们实证研究了2007-2008年全球金融危机前、中、后时期股东超额控制权（控制权大于现金流权）对银行盈利能力和风险的影响。通过手工构建的独特数据集，我们追踪了788家欧洲商业银行的完整控制链，涵盖2002-2010年期间。研究发现，在危机前（2002-2006）和危机后（2009-2010），超额控制权的存在与较低盈利能力、较高风险承担及较高违约风险相关；而在危机期间（2007-2008），超额控制权反而提升盈利能力且不再影响风险。进一步证据表明，无论处于哪个时期，超额控制权对盈利能力和风险的影响在家族控股银行及股东保护较弱的国家更为显著，且这种效应仅在中高等超额控制权水平下有效。总体而言，我们的发现为研究2007-2008年金融危机期间银行绩效的公司治理决定因素提供了文献贡献，并具有多重政策启示。资源链接: ExcessControlRights, Financial Crisis and Bank Profitability andRisk",

        "content": "Since supplier insolvencies are a major source of supply chain disruptions, scholars have continuously suggested managing supply chain risk management (SCRM) proactively in order to avoid their occurrence. However, business practice seems to fail with this task. This paper investigates antecedents which foster proactive SCRM implementation from a contingency theory perspective. As a major contingency we choose past supplier insolvencies as an indicator for the level of vulnerability of organisations and investigate inter-organisational, intra-organisational, and individual antecedents. By consulting supply chain management and management accounting literature, hypotheses are developed and tested via content analysis in 63 interviews with representatives from the automotive industry. The findings demonstrate that a mechanistic management control system, a rational cognitive style and relational buyer-supplier relationships have positive impacts on proactively managing supplier insolvency risks. Furthermore, past experience with supplier insolvencies has a moderating, though not a direct, effect on proactiveness. This research suggests that a holistic risk management approach is required to proactively mitigate supplier insolvency risk.由于供应商破产是供应链中断的主要原因，学者们一直建议主动实施供应链风险管理（SCRM）以避免其发生。然而，商业实践似乎未能完成这一任务。本文从权变理论视角出发，探究了推动主动实施SCRM的前因变量。我们选择过往供应商破产事件作为组织脆弱性水平的主要权变指标，并研究了组织间、组织内及个体层面的前因变量。通过梳理供应链管理和管理会计文献，研究提出假设并采用内容分析法对汽车行业代表的63份访谈数据进行验证。结果表明：机械式管理控制系统、理性认知风格以及买方-供应商关系对主动管理供应商破产风险具有积极影响；此外，过往供应商破产经历虽不直接作用于主动性，但能发挥调节效应。本研究指出，需采用全面风险管理方法才能主动降低供应商破产风险。资源链接: Antecedents of Proactive Supply ChainRiskManagement– A Contingency Theory Perspective",

Our framework is further differentiated based on whether firms are predominantly engaged in manufacturing or services – a factor influencing how supply chain risk is managed. Transaction cost economics serves as our main theoretical anchor. By rigorously grounding our research in both theory and empirical evidence, we provide valuable insight for both academia and practice.供应链风险管理已成为企业关注的核心问题，当前经济金融危机进一步凸显其重要性。在此背景下，本文探究了企业应对这一新形势的成功实践与经验，尤其聚焦于供应端管理。通过对八家欧洲企业的深度案例研究，我们提出关于企业在金融危机中管理供应风险的一系列命题，揭示其风险管理模式的转变，并阐明这些实践与企业风险管理的关联性。我们的研究框架还根据企业主要从事制造业或服务业进行了细分——这一因素影响着供应链风险的管理方式。交易成本经济学理论构成我们的主要理论基础。通过将研究严格扎根于理论与实证依据，我们为学术界和实践领域提供了有价值的见解。资源链接: Supply ChainRiskManagementin Financial Crises – A Multiple Case-Study Approach",

The GATS is generally associated in this context with a bottom-up (positive-list) scheduling approach where the sectors on which trade commitments are undertaken are selected individually. This is claimed to be less efficient, in terms of liberalization effects, than alternative approaches under which everything is considered to be fully committed unless specifically excluded (top-down or negative listing). However, a closer look at services negotiations conducted in various settings, including the Doha-Round process, WTO accession cases and different types of regional trade agreements, suggests that such structural issues have limited, if any, impact on the results achieved. What ultimately matters are not negotiating or scheduling techniques, but the political impetus that the governments concerned are ready to generate.本文针对近期各方提出的关于《服务贸易总协定》(GATS)存在结构性缺陷、阻碍世贸组织成员推进服务贸易自由化的主张展开探讨。在此背景下，GATS通常被认为采用自下而上(肯定列表)的承诺方式，即各成员自主选择开放的服务部门。有观点指出，相较于”除非明确排除否则全面开放”(自上而下或否定列表)的承诺模式，这种模式在自由化效果上效率较低。然而，深入考察多哈回合谈判、世贸组织加入案例及各类区域贸易协定中的服务贸易谈判实践可发现，此类结构性问题对实际谈判成果的影响微乎其微。最终起决定性作用的并非谈判技巧或承诺方式，而是相关政府推动自由化的政治意愿。资源链接: How to DesignTradeAgreements in Services: Top Down or Bottom Up?",

At the same time, China has become the main target of Indian antidumping measures with a number of measures that is unprecedented worldwide. This paper provides a detailed analysis of trade flows between the two emerging economies and investigates on which type of products and in which sectors the Indian government applies antidumping measures against China. Then this paper estimates the trade impact of those measures that were imposed during the Great Recession, using monthly data on exports from China to India. The use of monthly data is relatively new to the literature and allows a detailed examination of the trade impact of antidumping measures and its dynamics. This paper finds that antidumping measures decrease the Chinese export value and quantity to India immediately and to a significant extent. The impact is quite stable over time.近年来，中国作为印度贸易伙伴的重要性大幅提升。与此同时，中国已成为印度反倾销措施的主要目标国，其针对中国实施的反倾销案件数量在全球范围内前所未有。本文详细分析了这两个新兴经济体之间的贸易流动，探究了印度政府对中国实施反倾销措施的产品类别与行业领域。随后，通过中国对印度出口的月度数据，本文评估了经济大衰退期间印度反倾销措施产生的贸易影响。采用月度数据在现有文献中较为新颖，有助于细致考察反倾销措施的贸易影响及其动态变化。研究发现，反倾销措施会立即且显著降低中国对印度的出口额与出口量，且这种影响随时间推移保持稳定。资源链接: Indian AntidumpingMeasuresAgainst China: Evidence from MonthlyTradeData",

Secondly, what explains their existence, given that PTAs usually already incorporate or resemble WTO rules on domestic regulatory measures, such as Article III of the GATT 1994 or the TBT Agreement, which address technical barriers to a certain extent? And, finally, are such rules consistent with the requirements set forth by WTO law?

We next explore the distinction between core risks, those that businesses process profitably and ancillary risks, all others that constitute a nuisance in that the firm possesses no special skills in dealing with them. In the final section, we share some normative thoughts about ERM as a process. The perspective is unabashedly that of the board member. At the end of the day, ERM is little more than formality designed to reduce the threat of terminal hazards, hazards that tend to be ignored in the normal course of events.本文深化了Greenbaum 2012年提出的议题。该论文曾提出一个思考企业风险管理（ERM）的框架。我们首先解构风险、风险管理和ERM的概念。这些都是尚未定论的理念，但已被采纳并应用于提升上市公司及其他关注存续问题的组织的管理技术。接着我们探讨核心风险（企业能从中盈利的业务风险）与附属风险（企业无特殊应对能力、构成经营困扰的其他风险）之间的区别。最后部分，我们分享关于ERM流程的规范性思考，毫不掩饰地从董事会成员的视角出发。归根结底，ERM不过是一种旨在减少致命威胁的形式化程序——那些在日常运营中容易被忽视的终极风险。资源链接: EnterpriseRiskManagementin Financial Intermediation Revisited",

        "content": "La version française de ce document est disponible àhttp://ssrn.com/abstract=2198583The study of risk management began after World War II. Risk management has long been associated with the use of market insurance to protect individuals and companies from various losses associated with accidents. Other forms of risk management, alternatives to market insurance, surfaced during the 1950s when market insurance was perceived as very costly and incomplete for protection against pure risk. The use of derivatives as risk management instruments arose during the 1970s, and expanded rapidly during the 1980s, as companies intensified their financial risk management. International risk regulation began in the 1980s, and financial firms developed internal risk management models and capital calculation formulas to hedge against unanticipated risks and reduce regulatory capital. Concomitantly, governance of risk management became essential, integrated risk management was introduced and the chief risk officer positions were created. Nonetheless, these regulations, governance rules and risk management methods failed to prevent the financial crisis that began in 2007.该文件的法文版本可在http://ssrn.com/abstract=2198583获取。风险管理研究始于第二次世界大战后。长期以来，风险管理一直与利用市场保险来保护个人和企业免受各种意外损失相关联。20世纪50年代，当市场保险被认为成本高昂且无法全面防范纯粹风险时，其他形式的风险管理方法应运而生，成为市场保险的替代方案。衍生品作为风险管理工具的使用兴起于20世纪70年代，并在80年代迅速扩展，因为企业加强了其金融风险管理。国际风险监管始于20世纪80年代，金融机构开发了内部风险管理模型和资本计算公式，以对冲意外风险并减少监管资本。与此同时，风险管理的治理变得至关重要，综合风险管理被引入，并设立了首席风险官职位。然而，这些法规、治理规则和风险管理方法未能阻止始于2007年的金融危机。资源链接: RiskManagement: History, Definition and Critique",

        "content": "In his State of the Union speech, President Obama announced that the United States will launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union. This initiative is big news, and potentially a game-changer for trade liberalization. For years now, trade talks at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other fora have been stalled or grinding along slowly. By limiting the transatlantic talks to two economies that are relatively supportive of free trade, and are at the same development level, perhaps trade negotiators will at last have some success. A completed agreement here could generate momentum for broader trade liberalization around the world. More immediately, the economic benefits of this trade deal would be great, as the United States and the European Union are the two largest economies in the world, and their trade flows with the world account for almost one third of global trade. However, there may be some stumbling blocks along the way. If the United States and the European Union take on an agenda that is too broad, it may turn out that these trade talks fare no better than other current trade talks. In order to succeed, it is important that the negotiations have realistic goals and a clear path to completion. The precise scope of the talks remains somewhat vague at this point, but a framework is set out in the Final Report of the U.S.–EU High-Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth. The report indicates that various forms of protectionism will be addressed, and also suggests that the talks will delve further into domestic regulatory issues than most current trade agreements do. While such an expansion of international trade rules does hold the potential for significant economic benefits, it also tests the limits of how far trade agreements can go in terms of global trade governance. Including issues that the trading system cannot handle may doom the talks from the start, and negotiators should be careful about how they approach this.美国总统奥巴马在国情咨文中宣布，美国将与欧盟启动全面的《跨大西洋贸易与投资伙伴关系协定》谈判。这一举措意义重大，可能成为贸易自由化的转折点。多年来，世界贸易组织（WTO）及其他多边框架下的贸易谈判始终陷于停滞或进展迟缓。此次谈判仅限两个自由贸易支持度高且发展水平相当的经济体参与，或许能让贸易谈判者首次看到成功的曙光。协定的达成有望为全球范围内更广泛的贸易自由化注入动力。更直接来看，这份贸易协定将带来巨大经济效益——美欧作为全球前两大经济体，其对外贸易总额占全球贸易近三分之一。但谈判进程可能面临阻碍。若美欧设定的议程过于宽泛，这些贸易谈判或将重蹈当前其他贸易谈判的覆辙。为确保成功，谈判必须设定现实目标并明确完成路径。目前谈判的具体范围尚不明确，但《美欧就业与增长高级别工作组最终报告》已勾勒出基本框架。报告显示将解决各类保护主义问题，并暗示谈判将比现行多数贸易协定更深入触及国内监管议题。尽管这种国际贸易规则的扩展可能带来显著经济效益，但也试探着贸易协定在全球贸易治理范畴的边界。纳入现有贸易体系无法处理的议题可能使谈判伊始就注定失败，谈判代表须审慎把握尺度。资源链接: The Challenges of Negotiating a TransatlanticTradeand Investment Partnership",

        "content": "This paper examines some of the perceived tensions between free trade and regulation of tobacco for health purposes and concludes that most of the concerns about trade and investment agreements undermining domestic regulation are unfounded and that special rules for tobacco are unnecessary. Free trade itself does not raise national sovereignty concerns, nor does it interfere with domestic policymaking to any significant degree. Although there may be valid concerns about some of the more recent additions to trade and investment agreements (i.e., rules that go beyond fighting protectionism), the core of these rules constrains domestic regulation only to the extent that such regulation discriminates against imports and does not preclude legitimate domestic policymaking.本文探讨了自由贸易与出于健康目的对烟草进行监管之间的一些表面冲突，并得出结论：关于贸易和投资协定会削弱国内监管的多数担忧缺乏依据，针对烟草制定特殊规则并无必要。自由贸易本身不会引发国家主权关切，也不会对国内政策制定造成显著干扰。尽管对于贸易和投资协定中新增内容（即超出反保护主义范畴的规则）可能存在合理担忧，但这些规则的核心仅限制那些歧视进口产品的国内监管措施，并不妨碍正当的国内政策制定。资源链接: FreeTradeand Tobacco: Thank You for Not Smoking (Foreign) Cigarettes",

        "content": "Rising current account and merchandise trade imbalances marked the years before the global financial and economic crisis. These imbalances either contributed to or precipitated the crisis and to the extent that they create systemic risks, it is desirable that they be reduced. There are many factors related to macroeconomic, structural, exchange rate and financial policies that contributed to the imbalances. The inability to manage these issues at the international level reflects the “coherence gap” in global governance. This paper examines the contribution that the WTO can make in its three areas of activities — negotiations, rule-making and dispute settlement — to deal with trade imbalances and with the main factors leading to them, including exchange rate misalignments. First, market opening efforts in services, including in the area of financial services, can reduce policy-related distortions and market imperfections in surplus countries that lead to the build-up of unsustainable imbalances. Second, in the context of a broad international effort to coordinate macroeconomic, exchange rate and structural policies to deal with the roots of imbalances (the first-best solution), there is a general efficiency argument that could be made for the use of WTO-triggered trade actions to enforce cooperative behaviour towards rebalancing. Absent this first-best response, trade rules alone would not provide an efficient instrument to compensate for the weaknesses in international co-operation in macroeconomic, exchange rate and structural policies.全球金融和经济危机爆发前的几年间，经常账户和商品贸易不平衡问题日益凸显。这些失衡现象要么加剧了危机，要么直接引发了危机。鉴于其可能引发系统性风险，降低失衡程度势在必行。导致失衡的因素众多，涉及宏观经济政策、结构性政策、汇率政策及金融政策等多个方面。国际层面无力解决这些问题，反映出全球治理存在”协调缺口”。本文探讨了世贸组织在其三大职能领域——谈判协商、规则制定和争端解决——能为应对贸易失衡及其主要诱因（包括汇率失调）作出何种贡献。首先，在服务领域（含金融服务）推进市场开放，有助于减少顺差国政策扭曲和市场缺陷，从而缓解不可持续失衡的累积。其次，在国际社会协调宏观经济政策、汇率政策和结构性政策以解决失衡根源（最优方案）的整体框架下，存在一个普遍效率论据：可运用世贸组织触发的贸易行动来推动各方采取合作性再平衡举措。若缺乏这种最优应对方案，仅靠贸易规则无法有效弥补国际间在宏观经济、汇率和结构性政策合作方面的不足。资源链接: TradeImbalances and MultilateralTradeCooperation",

In this article, we focus on Operational Risk Management for mid-sized Asset Management companies. We take a practitioner’s view of how an operational risk framework can be implemented as part of an enterprise wide Risk and Control system in a “hands-on” approach. The focus of our contribution is on practical implementation with simple tools, like Excel, rather than trying to quantify operational risk with complex mathematical formulas.

        "content": "This chapter deals with the rules on trade in goods in the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement. It is organized, as follows. First, the rules on market access, that is, the EU-Korea FTA provisions related to import measures applicable at the border, will be delineated and analyzed. Subsequently, aspects of one of the most innovative parts of the agreement will be examined in detail: the section containing rules on domestic regulation, in particular, on technical regulations and standards. This paper shows two sides of the EU–Korea FTA. On the one hand, it is a very traditional trade agreement, largely based on existing WTO provisions. This is particularly the case in those parts of the agreement concerning border measures. On the other hand, in particular, concerning the sector-specific rules on technical barriers to trade, the agreement is quite innovative and breaks new grounds, with respect to the regulation of domestic instruments. Moreover, the Agreement is, to a large extent, a ‘living instrument’. Many of the remaining lacunae in the field of domestic regulation must be dealt with in the future, through cooperation and consultations within the different committees and working groups. This is the Agreement’s approach to tackle its endogenous incompleteness, which is inherent in any trade agreement. From this angle, the EU–Korea FTA may not only be understood as a static body of rules, but also as a framework for collaboration that helps to find prompt and appropriate responses to changes in real-world conditions, thus facilitating trade relations between the parties in the long run.本章探讨《欧盟-韩国自由贸易协定》中关于货物贸易的规则，内容安排如下：首先将界定并分析市场准入规则，即协定中与边境进口措施相关的条款。随后将详细研究该协定最具创新性的部分之一——涉及国内监管规则的内容，特别是技术法规与标准的相关规定。. . 本文揭示了《欧盟-韩国自贸协定》的双重特性。一方面，这是一份高度传统的贸易协定，其主要条款基于现行世贸组织规则，这在涉及边境措施的部分尤为明显。另一方面，该协定在技术性贸易壁垒的行业特定规则方面颇具创新性，为国内监管工具的规范开辟了新路径。此外，该协定在很大程度上属于”动态文件”，国内监管领域尚存的诸多空白需通过各委员会和工作组未来的合作与磋商来填补。这种机制正是协定应对其内生不完整性的解决之道——这种不完整性是所有贸易协定与生俱来的特质。. . 从这个角度看，《欧盟-韩国自贸协定》不仅可视为静态的规则体系，更是一个促进合作的框架。它有助于双方对现实条件变化作出迅速而恰当的应对，从而长远地巩固双边贸易关系。资源链接: Tradein Goods Under the EU–Korea FTA: Market Access and RegulatoryMeasures",

By analysing the balance sheet of a small Italian bank during the years 2009 and 2010, we outlined its liquidity profile, the variables that influenced its dynamics and their effects on the bank’s global management, with particular attention to the interest margin and the interest rate risk in the banking book. We would like to fill a gap identified in the literature, shedding light on how a set of decisions designed mainly to reduce the liquidity risk and comply with the new parameters established by the Basel III Framework enables a more effective management of the regulatory capital and helps the bank to achieve a solid balance between profitability and solvency. Our main findings demonstrate that the bank succeeded in modifying its liquidity profile in order to comply with the incoming constraints imposed by the Basel III framework; the actions taken to reduce the liquidity risk also lowered its interest margin, but also enabled the bank to reduce the amount of capital absorbed by the interest rate risk, giving rise to a globally positive effect.本研究旨在确定信贷机构的流动性风险与利率风险之间是否存在关联。通过分析一家意大利小型银行2009至2010年间的资产负债表，我们勾勒出该行的流动性状况、影响其动态变化的变量及其对银行整体管理的影响，尤其关注银行账簿中的净息差与利率风险。我们试图填补现有文献的空白，揭示一系列主要为降低流动性风险并满足《巴塞尔协议III》新规要求的决策，如何能更有效地管理监管资本，并帮助银行在盈利性与偿付能力之间实现稳固平衡。主要研究结果表明：该银行成功调整了流动性状况以符合《巴塞尔协议III》即将实施的约束要求；降低流动性风险的相关举措虽减少了净息差，但同时减少了利率风险所占用的资本金额，从而产生了整体积极效应。资源链接: LiquidityRiskand Interest RateRiskon Banks: Are They Related?",

        "content": "With international trade moving from “trade in (final) goods” to “trade in tasks”, effective protection rates (EPRs) are back to the stage. Input-output matrices are used in this paper to monitor the production structure of 10 Asian-Pacific countries between 1995 and 2005, and to calculate sectorial EPRs. The paper proposes a series of counter-factual simulation methods aimed at isolating the specific contribution of changes in tariff policies, in production structure or in real exchange rates. International input-output matrices allowed also to compute and compare the average propagation length of a cost-push linked to a sudden change in tariff duties, identifying those sectors that are the most deeply interconnected, both in the intensity and in the length of their inter-industrial foreign relationships.随着国际贸易从“（最终）商品贸易”转向“任务贸易”，有效保护率（EPRs）重新回到舞台中央。本文运用投入产出矩阵追踪了1995至2005年间10个亚太国家的生产结构，并计算了各行业的有效保护率。研究提出了一系列反事实模拟方法，旨在分离关税政策变化、生产结构调整或实际汇率波动的具体影响。国际投入产出矩阵还能测算并比较关税突然变动引发的成本推动效应的平均传导时长，从而识别出那些在产业间国际关联强度与持续时间维度上深度融合的行业。资源链接: Reassessing Effective Protection Rates in aTradein Tasks Perspective: Evolution ofTradePolicy in ‘Factory Asia’",

In this article, the author analyzes the best instrument, namely self discipline, official discipline and market discipline, for the effective risk management. In the light of literature review and lessons of firm/system wide financial failures, we also analyze degree of efficiency of disciplinary methods. We first conclude, however it may not provide optimal solutions to the risk management problems of financial intermediaries, better risk management standards should be developed. We also conclude that firm wide risk management processes may be managed by pragmatic regulatory policies without get into negative impacts of market mechanism and big financial firms’ pressures.全球金融危机中观察到的金融失败再次凸显了有效风险管理的重要性。本文作者分析了实现有效风险管理的最佳工具，即自律、官方监管与市场约束。基于文献综述及企业/系统层面金融失败的教训，我们还评估了各类约束方法的效率程度。首先我们得出结论：尽管可能无法为金融中介机构的风险管理问题提供最优解，但仍需制定更完善的风险管理标准。其次我们认为，通过务实的监管政策可实现企业全面风险管理流程的优化，同时避免市场机制与大型金融机构压力带来的负面影响。资源链接: Financial Failures andRiskManagement",

        "content": "The paper investigates the effects of trade liberalization on the technical efficiency of the Bangladesh manufacturing sector by estimating a combined stochastic frontier-inefficiency model using panel data for the period 1978–94 for 25 three-digit level industries. The results show that the overall technical efficiency of the manufacturing sector as well as the technical efficiencies of the majority of the individual industries has increased over time. The findings also clearly suggest that trade liberalization, proxied by export orientation and capital deepening, has had significant impact on the reduction of the overall technical inefficiency. Similarly, the scale of operation and the proportion of nonproduction labor in total employment appear as important determinants of technical inefficiency. The evidence also indicates that both export-promoting and import-substituting industries have experienced rises in technical efficiencies over time. Besides, the results are suggestive of neutral technical change, although (at the 5 per cent level of significance) the empirical results indicate that there was no technical change in the manufacturing industries. Finally, the joint test based on the likelihood ratio (LR) test rejects the Cobb-Douglas production technology as description of the database given the specification of the translog production technology.该研究通过运用1978年至1994年间25个三位数级别行业的面板数据，构建随机前沿-低效组合模型，探讨了贸易自由化对孟加拉国制造业技术效率的影响。结果表明：制造业整体技术效率及多数细分行业技术效率均呈现随时间提升的趋势。研究明确显示，以出口导向和资本深化为代表的贸易自由化措施对降低整体技术低效率具有显著作用。运营规模与非生产性劳动力占比同样被证实是技术低效率的关键影响因素。数据还表明，无论是出口导向型还是进口替代型行业，其技术效率均随时间推移有所提高。尽管在5%显著性水平上实证结果显示制造业未发生技术变革，但研究结果仍暗示存在中性技术变化。最后，基于似然比检验的联合检验表明，在超越对数生产函数设定条件下，柯布-道格拉斯生产技术不能有效描述该数据库特征。资源链接: TradeLiberalisation andTechnicalEfficiency: Evidence from Bangladesh Manufacturing Industries",

        "content": "The proliferation of regional trade agreements (“RTAs”) behoves all WTO members to assess the extent to which RTAs depart from fundamental principles in the WTO such as the most-favoured-nation (“MFN”) treatment in the GATT and in particular, the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade.  This paper focuses on technical barriers to trade (“TBT”) provisions in RTAs concluded by the United States, European Union, Australia and Singapore and finds that these TBT provisions complement the existing disciplines in the TBT Agreement.  To the extent that TBT provisions in RTAs may be inconsistent with the TBT Agreement, this paper examines the extent to which they can be justified under Article XXIV of GATT.  This paper concludes that the ambiguity of key terms in Article XXIV of GATT allows WTO Members to adopt an expansive interpretation of the scope of Article XXIV of GATT.区域贸易协定（“RTAs”）的激增促使所有世贸组织成员评估这些协定在多大程度上偏离了世贸组织的基本原则，如《关税及贸易总协定》中的最惠国待遇（“MFN”），尤其是《世贸组织技术性贸易壁垒协定》。本文聚焦于美国、欧盟、澳大利亚和新加坡签署的区域贸易协定中的技术性贸易壁垒（“TBT”）条款，发现这些条款对《技术性贸易壁垒协定》现有规则形成了补充。针对区域贸易协定中可能与该协定不一致的技术性贸易壁垒条款，本文探讨了其在《关税及贸易总协定》第二十四条项下的合理性依据。研究结论表明，《关税及贸易总协定》第二十四条关键术语的模糊性使得世贸组织成员能够对该条款适用范围作出宽泛解释。资源链接: TechnicalBarriers toTradeProvisions in RegionalTradeAgreements",

Financial and non-financial companies of Public Listed Companies (PLCs) of service sector had been chosen as a population to determine the crucial factors that should be considered for a success implementation of EWRM. A triangulation approach was adopted to get an enriched data collection and analysis for the study. From a survey on 14 financial companies and 41 non-financial companies and 4 companies of a case study, it is found that organisational culture is a most critical factor which contributes more to a success implementation of EWRM and has an effect on shareholder value. Significantly, the function and the effectiveness of other critical success factors were depended on strong organisational culture. The other EWRM critical success factors identified were risk management base, compliance, resource, cross-functional staff, knowledge management, and authority or power.本文探讨了影响股东价值的有效企业全面风险管理（EWRM）实践的关键成功因素。研究选取服务业上市公司中的金融与非金融企业作为样本，以确定成功实施EWRM需考虑的核心要素。采用三角验证法进行数据收集与分析，通过对14家金融公司、41家非金融公司及4家案例企业的调研发现：组织文化是推动EWRM成功实施并影响股东价值的最关键因素。值得注意的是，其他关键成功因素的效能均依赖于强有力的组织文化。研究还识别出风险管理制度基础、合规性、资源配置、跨部门协作、知识管理及职权划分等其他EWRM关键成功因素。资源链接: Enterprise-WideRiskManagementBest Practices: The Critical Success Factors",

        "content": "Financial Services are a key infrastructure component of trade in goods and services, crucial for economic development, with strong backward and forward linkages with the overall economy. As past financial crisis have shown, the cost of failure in the financial sector can be high. Given the importance of the sector, the impact of the financial crisis and the lessons that can be learnt, ensuring national and global financial stability to support economic stability is a global public good. This chapter attempts to give an overview of the importance of and recent developments in the FS sector, specifically as they relate to the interests of developing countries. This chapter draws on UNCTAD’s work in the FS sector including observations made by experts during UNCTAD meetings on financial and insurance services and the regulatory and institutional aspects of infrastructure services. This note considers in Part I the importance of the financial sector and its role in the national economy. In particular it weighs the arguments for and against financial liberalization including capital account liberalization. Part II provides an overview of financial markets, tracing developments prior to and subsequent to the financial crisis. It focuses on global market trends, specifically the potential of microfinance, South-South trade in financial services, outsourcing in the financial services sector and Islamic finance. Part III takes a closer look at the financial crisis in terms of its causes, costs, potential impact on developing countries and more broadly policy implications for the financial sector as a whole. Part IV considers briefly the role and importance of regulation. In particular it examines the kinds of approaches countries adopt toward regulation in the FS sector and the formulation and implications of adopting international standards. Part V looks at the post crisis development in the financial regulatory landscape specifically developments in the US, EU and Basel Committee on Banking and Supervision. It then sets out the possible implications this evolving regulatory landscape could have for global co-operation and developing countries. Part VI focuses on the trade aspects of financial services. It looks at financial services trade liberalization in the World Trade Organization and at a bilateral and regional level. It then examines possible interlinkages between financial services, trade commitments, and the bail out packages and financial sector interventions made in light of the financial crisis.金融服务是商品和服务贸易的关键基础设施组成部分，对经济发展至关重要，与整体经济具有强大的后向和前向关联。历史金融危机表明，金融部门的失败代价可能极其高昂。鉴于该行业的重要性、金融危机的影响以及可汲取的教训，确保国家和全球金融稳定以支持经济稳定是一项全球公共产品。本章试图概述金融服务业的重要性及最新发展，特别是与发展中国家利益相关的方面。本章借鉴了联合国贸发会议在金融服务业的工作成果，包括金融与保险服务会议上专家提出的观点，以及基础设施服务的监管与制度层面讨论。. . 第一部分阐述金融部门的重要性及其在国民经济中的作用，重点权衡金融自由化（包括资本账户开放）的利弊。第二部分纵览金融市场发展脉络，梳理金融危机前后的演变历程，聚焦全球市场趋势——特别是小额信贷的潜力、南南金融服务贸易、金融服务外包及伊斯兰金融。第三部分深入分析金融危机的成因、代价、对发展中国家的潜在影响，以及更广泛的金融业政策启示。第四部分简要探讨监管的作用与重要性，具体考察各国对金融服务业采取的监管模式，以及采纳国际标准的制定过程与影响。第五部分研究危机后金融监管格局的变化，重点关注美国、欧盟和巴塞尔银行监管委员会的改革动态，并探讨这种演变中的监管框架对全球合作与发展中国家的潜在影响。第六部分聚焦金融服务的贸易维度，分析世界贸易组织框架内及双边、区域层面的金融服务贸易自由化，进而审视金融服务、贸易承诺与金融危机背景下的救助方案及金融部门干预措施之间可能存在的关联。资源链接: Tradein Financial Services, Financial Crisis and Development Implications: What is Important and What Has Changed?",

        "content": "In this article, we review the literature on the measurement of trade costs in international trade with a special emphasis on nontariff measures and in particular on standards and technical regulations. We distinguish ‘direct’ from ‘indirect’ approaches. The direct approach collects observable data or proxy variables on trade cost components which are then typically used as regressors in a gravity equation of trade. Instead, the indirect approach infers the extent of trade impediments from trade flows. It compares actual trade flows to the trade flows predicted by a hypothetical frictionless benchmark scenario based on a micro-founded trade model, attributing the deviation of actual from predicted trade flows to trade frictions. We argue that economists and policymakers can gain useful insights from both approaches.本文回顾了有关国际贸易中贸易成本测算的文献，特别关注非关税措施，尤其是标准与技术法规。我们区分了”直接”与”间接”两种研究方法。直接法通过收集贸易成本构成要素的可观测数据或代理变量，通常将其作为贸易引力方程中的回归变量；而间接法则从贸易流量反推贸易障碍程度，通过将实际贸易流量与基于微观基础贸易模型构建的无摩擦基准情景下的预测值进行对比，将二者偏差归因于贸易摩擦。我们认为经济学家与政策制定者可从两种方法中获取有益洞见。资源链接: On the Measurement ofTradeCosts: Direct vs. Indirect Approaches to Quantifying Standards andTechnicalRegulations",

        "content": "In an attempt to disentangle the impact of sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures on trade patterns, we estimate a Heckman selection model on the HS4 disaggregated level of trade. Using SPS measures obtained from the SPS Information Management System of the WTO and controlling for zero trade flows, we find that SPS concerns reduce the probability of trade in agricultural and food products consistently. However, the amount of trade is positively affected by SPS measures conditional on market entry. This suggests that SPS measures constitute an effective market entry barrier. Additionally, we split SPS measures into requirements related to conformity assessment, and product characteristics. Both types of measures are implemented by policy makers to achieve a desired level of health safety, yet, entail diverse trade costs. We find that conformity assessment measures hamper not only the likelihood to trade but also the amount of trade, while measures related to product characteristics do not affect the market entry decision, but have a strong positive impact on the trade volume. This suggests that trade outcomes crucially depend on the measure policy makers decide to implement.为厘清卫生与植物检疫（SPS）措施对贸易模式的影响，我们在HS4细分贸易层级上构建了赫克曼选择模型。通过采用WTO的SPS信息管理系统中获取的SPS措施数据，并控制零贸易流量后，我们发现SPS关切持续降低农产品和食品贸易的发生概率。然而在进入市场的前提下，SPS措施对贸易量却产生正向影响，这表明SPS措施构成了有效的市场准入壁垒。此外，我们将SPS措施划分为符合性评估要求和产品特性要求两类。虽然政策制定者实施这两类措施均旨在实现特定健康安全标准，但其产生的贸易成本存在差异。研究发现：符合性评估措施不仅抑制贸易发生概率，还会缩减贸易规模；而产品特性措施虽不影响市场准入决策，却对贸易量产生显著正向影响。这表明贸易效果本质上取决于政策制定者选择实施的措施类型。资源链接: SPSMeasuresandTrade: Implementation Matters",

The Hellenic crisis is the product of years of recession, of the sluggish economic environment and poor productivity – but above all it is the product of the mismanagement of the public finance, of unsatisfactory reporting, risk management and accounting practices. Information about Greece is scarce and fragmented, but the inability by European authorities to understand the incredible mismanagement strongly disappoints the taxpayer. The relevant exposure of European banks in the bond market toward the default risk of Greece supports the need for hedging tools, such as Credit Default Swaps. However, there is evidence that the CDS market on Greek sovereign bonds is segmented, and contracts are mis-priced. The lack of comprehensive data on CDS and other OTC contracts impedes any further investigation. European authorities should consider revising CDSs trading rules and requirements, until the risks produced are properly limited.2010年，过度的公共支出引发了欧洲首场主权债券市场危机：希腊。这场希腊危机是多年经济衰退、疲软经济环境和低效生产力的产物——但归根结底源于公共财政管理不善、财务报告不达标、风险管理与会计实务缺陷。关于希腊的信息稀缺且零散，但欧洲当局对这种严重管理失察的无知令纳税人深感失望。欧洲银行在债券市场对希腊违约风险的相关敞口，凸显了对信用违约互换等对冲工具的需求。然而有证据表明希腊主权债券的CDS市场存在分割现象，合约定价存在偏差。CDS及其他场外合约数据的全面缺失阻碍了进一步调查。欧洲当局应考虑修订信用违约互换的交易规则和要求，直至其产生的风险得到有效控制。资源链接: TheManagementof Greek SovereignRisk",

As a consequence, a growing number of RTAs include provisions on NTMs. This paper investigates the effect of standards-harmonization clauses contained in many North-South Agreements on international trade. Using a gravity equation, we find that (i) North-South harmonization of technical regulations reinforces a hub-and-spoke trade structure potentially detrimental to the development of South-South trade and (ii) harmonization on regional standards hurts Southern exports to the North. Thus, standards-harmonization provisions included in many recent North-South RTAs miss their target and contribute to marginalize Southern countries in the world economy.近年来，区域贸易协定（RTAs）数量激增，非关税措施（NTMs）也持续发展。其结果是越来越多的区域贸易协定开始纳入非关税措施条款。本文研究了众多南北协定中的标准协调条款对国际贸易的影响。通过引力模型分析，我们发现：（一）南北技术法规的协调强化了”中心-辐条”式贸易结构，可能阻碍南南贸易的发展；（二）采用区域标准进行协调会损害南方国家对北方的出口。因此，当前诸多南北区域贸易协定中的标准协调条款未能实现预期目标，反而加剧了南方国家在世界经济中的边缘化地位。资源链接: North-South Standards Harmonization and InternationalTrade",

The link between NTMs and supply chains also has implications for economic development and for the relationship between liberalization in services and goods.通过国际贸易将地理上分散的多个生产环节连接起来的商品制造方式日益普遍。这种被称为”生产分割”“加工贸易”或”垂直专业化”的趋势，对非关税措施和贸易便利化的分析具有重要意义。首先，不同类型的非关税措施或贸易便利化问题自然对应货物流动的不同环节。可将不同的价格差异归因于这些环节，从而分解总体扭曲程度，并优先考虑可能带来最大效率提升的政策。其次，非关税措施可能在长供应链中累积，意味着其对分段生产商品的贸易扭曲效应大于简单生产流程的商品。有证据表明，贸易成本对高科技产品或需多道加工工序的商品更为重要。产品标准问题对长供应链商品可能尤为关键。非关税措施与供应链的关联还对经济发展以及服务与货物贸易自由化之间的关系具有启示意义。资源链接: Using Supply Chain Analysis to Examine the Costs of Non-TariffMeasures(NTMs) and the Benefits ofTradeFacilitation",

Given the intensity and scope of technical measures imposed by China, the directional impacts of technical barriers to trade (TBTs) on bilateral ASEAN-China exports are investigated empirically using an augmented gravity model. The results imply that Chinese TBTs do have some trade depressing effects from the ASEAN perspective. However, sectoral trade effects of TBTs are important as dual effects exist even within some TBT intensive product groups. This informs the policy debate on the effects of NTMs from the ASEAN-China perspective more specifically, and the “South-South” context more generally on two fronts. First, the identification of specific trade restricting meaures for the affected sectors will assist in determining policy priorities within the ASEAN-China context. Second, trade facilitation measures that increase the business costs to the ASEAN exporters also warrant attention in addressing the scale of market access issues in China.本文探讨了中国并存且直接影响进口的各类非关税措施(NTMs)。鉴于中国实施技术措施的强度与广度，研究采用扩展引力模型实证检验了技术性贸易壁垒(TBTs)对东盟-中国双边出口的定向影响。结果表明，从东盟视角看，中国的TBTs确实存在一定的贸易抑制效应。但TBTs的行业贸易效应具有重要性，因为即便在某些TBT密集型产品类别中也存在双重效应。这从两个层面为政策讨论提供了更具体的东盟-中国视角及更广义的”南南合作”背景下的NTMs影响分析：首先，识别受影响行业的具体贸易限制措施将有助于确定东盟-中国框架下的政策优先事项；其次，那些增加东盟出口商商业成本的贸易便利化措施，在解决中国市场准入规模问题时同样值得关注。资源链接: Proliferation of Non-TariffMeasuresin China – Their Relevance for ASEAN",

The traditional gravity equation model estimates the net effect of these measures on international trade with a loss of useful inference on separate effects. We stipulate a generalized gravity equation model to disentangle the two effects. We apply the augmented approach to agricultural trade among OECD countries in 2004. We find that technical measures in agriculture often jointly enhance import demand and hinder export supply with the net effect of promoting the propensity to trade. Further disaggregated data analysis reveals heterogeneity across sectors in terms of net effects of technical measures, despite common demand-enhancing and supply-hindering effects. These measures in the net decrease the probability of intra-OECD trade in dairy products, whereas they increase that of intra-OECD trade in cereal preparations.诸如SPS和TBT等国内技术措施，既可通过信息披露和质量提升来增强进口需求，也可通过施加大量合规成本阻碍外国出口供应，或同时产生双重影响。传统引力方程模型仅能估算这些措施对国际贸易的净效应，却无法解析其各自独立效应。为此我们构建广义引力方程模型以分离这两种效应，并运用增强方法分析2004年经合组织国家间农产品贸易。研究发现农业技术措施通常同时具备增强进口需求与抑制出口供应的双重特性，其净效应表现为提升贸易倾向性。更细化的数据分析显示：尽管各行业普遍存在需求促进与供给抑制效应，技术措施的净效应存在显著行业异质性——这些措施总体上降低了经合组织内部乳制品贸易概率，却提高了谷物加工品贸易概率。资源链接: Disentangling the Demand-Enhancing Effect andTrade-Cost Effect ofTechnicalMeasuresin AgriculturalTradeAmong OECD Countries",

This paper offers a robust new method for estimating fraud rate, PRIDIT-FRE (PRIDIT-based Fraud Rate Estimation), developed based on PRIDIT, an unsupervised fraud detection method to assess individual claim fraud suspiciousness. PRIDIT-FRE presents the first nonparametric unsupervised estimator of the actual rate of fraud in a population of claims, robust to the bias contained in the audited sample (arising from the quality or individual hubris of an auditor or investigator, or the natural data gathering process through claims adjusting). PRIDIT-FRE exploits the internal consistency of fraud predictors and makes use of a small audited sample or even an unaudited sample to obtain an estimate of the fraud rate. Using two insurance fraud data sets with different characteristics, we illustrate the effectiveness of PRIDIT-FRE and examine its robustness in varying scenarios.若想有效管理欺诈行为，必须测量欺诈率以评估问题严重程度及反欺诈技术的有效性。本文提出一种基于PRIDIT（一种评估单个索赔欺诈可疑度的无监督欺诈检测方法）开发的稳健新方法——PRIDIT-FRE（基于PRIDIT的欺诈率估计法）。该方法首次实现了对索赔群体实际欺诈率的无监督非参数估计，能有效克服审计样本中的偏差（这种偏差可能源于审计员或调查员的能力局限、个人主观判断，或理赔调整过程中的自然数据收集流程）。PRIDIT-FRE通过挖掘欺诈预测因子的内在一致性，仅需少量审计样本甚至无需审计样本即可估算欺诈率。我们通过两个特征迥异的保险欺诈数据集，验证了PRIDIT-FRE的有效性，并检验了其在多种场景下的稳健性。资源链接: A Robust Unsupervised Method for Fraud Rate Estimation",

        "content": "Agriculture accounts for 13 percent of global GHG emissions. This rises to approximately 30 percent if land clearance for farming, agrochemical production and trade in agricultural and food products are attributed to the sector. Market based mechanisms (carbon tax, cap and trade, payment for environmental services) and voluntary mitigation measures (carbon labeling and food miles) are reviewed for their effectiveness (if they reduce emissions), efficiency (the costs of the measures) and equity (fairness to suppliers). Measures to reduce agricultural emissions are limited in their effectiveness and efficiency by the technical difficulty and high costs of measuring, reporting and verification. However, pricing carbon would be effective in internalizing negative externalities in the transport, processing, retail and consumer purchase and preparation of food. The GTAP model is used to illustrate that a US $40 carbon tax implemented in the EU would have little negative impact on developing country exporters of agricultural products due to their low carbon intensity. Carbon labeling and food miles initiatives are likely to be ineffective, inefficient and unfair to developing country exporters.农业占全球温室气体排放量的13%。如果将农田开垦、农用化学品生产以及农产品和食品贸易归入该行业，这一比例将上升至约30%。本文评估了基于市场的机制（碳税、限额与交易、环境服务付费）和自愿减排措施（碳标签和食物里程）在效果（是否能减少排放）、效率（措施的成本）和公平性（对供应商的公正程度）方面的表现。由于测量、报告和核查在技术上的难度和高成本，减少农业排放的措施在效果和效率上受到限制。然而，碳定价能有效将运输、加工、零售及消费者购买和准备食物过程中的负面外部性内部化。GTAP模型分析表明，欧盟实施40美元的碳税对发展中国家农产品出口商的负面影响较小，因其碳强度较低。碳标签和食物里程措施可能效果不佳、效率低下，且对发展中国家出口商不公平。资源链接: The Effectiveness, Efficiency and Equity of Market Based and VoluntaryMeasuresto Mitigate Greenhouse Gas Emissions from the Agri-Food Sector",

We focus on standard-like measures such as technical barriers and sanitary and phytosanitary regulations. The approach overcomes the shortcomings of the mainstream approach based on the analysis of forgone trade caused by trade costs. The latter ignores market imperfections: welfare increases when NTMs are removed and trade expands. We explain how to account for external effects and market failures in trade-focused welfare analysis, leading to a more balanced overall assessment of measures despite a potential reduction of trade flows. We show that the relationship between trade, welfare, and NTMs is complex. The optimum NTM is often not zero. An application to shrimp trade illustrates the feasibility of the proposed approach. The illustration shows that the reinforcement of a food safety standard can be socially preferable to the status-quo situation, both domestically and internationally.本文提出了一种基于福利的系统性方法，用于分析存在市场缺陷时非关税措施（NTMs）对贸易和福利的影响。我们重点关注技术性贸易壁垒、卫生与植物检疫法规等类标准措施。该方法克服了主流研究通过贸易成本分析所造成贸易损失这一路径的缺陷——后者忽视了市场缺陷的存在，简单认为取消非关税措施扩大贸易就能提升福利。我们阐述了如何在以贸易为核心的福利分析中纳入外部效应和市场失灵因素，从而对政策措施做出更全面的整体评估，即便这可能减少贸易流量。研究表明，贸易、福利与非关税措施之间存在复杂关联，最优非关税措施水平通常不为零。以虾类贸易为例的实证研究验证了本方法的可行性，该案例表明强化食品安全标准无论在国内还是国际层面，都可能成为比维持现状更具社会效益的选择。资源链接: Measuring Costs and Benefits of Non-TariffMeasuresin Agri-FoodTrade",

        "content": "As governments increasingly adopt policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, concern has grown on two fronts. First, carbon leakage can occur when mitigation policies are not the same across countries and producers seek to locate in jurisdictions where production costs are least affected by emission constraints. The risk of carbon leakage raises questions about the efficacy of climate change policies in a global sense. Secondly, it is precisely the cost-related consequences of differential mitigation policies that feed industry concerns about competitiveness. We thus have a link between environmental and competitiveness perspectives that fuses climate change and trade regimes in potentially problematic ways as governments contemplate trade actions to manage the environmental and/or competitiveness consequences of differential climate change policies. On the trade side of this relationship, we have the reality that the GATT/WTO rules were not originally drafted to accommodate climate change policies and concerns. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the relevance of certain WTO rules to the interface between climate change and trade, focusing in particular on border measures, technical regulations on trade, standards and labelling, and subsidies and countervailing duties. It concludes that in the absence of clear international understandings on how to manage the climate change and trade interface, we run the risk of a clash that compromises the effectiveness of climate change policies as well as the potential gains from specialization through trade.随着各国政府越来越多地采取减少温室气体排放的政策，两方面的担忧日益加剧。首先，当各国的减排政策不一致时，可能导致碳泄漏现象——生产商会选择将业务迁往受排放限制影响最小的地区。碳泄漏风险引发了人们对全球气候变化政策有效性的质疑。其次，正是这种差异化减排政策带来的成本问题，引发了产业界对竞争力的担忧。因此，在环境与竞争力视角之间形成了某种联系，这种联系以可能存在问题的方式将气候变化与贸易体制捆绑在一起——当政府考虑采取贸易行动来应对差异化气候变化政策带来的环境和/或竞争力影响时。从贸易层面看，关贸总协定/世贸组织规则最初制定时并未考虑气候变化政策及相关问题。本文旨在分析某些世贸组织规则与气候变化和贸易交叉领域的关联性，重点探讨边境措施、贸易技术法规、标准与标签制度以及补贴与反补贴税等问题。研究结论表明，若国际社会未能就如何协调气候变化与贸易关系达成明确共识，我们可能面临双重风险：既会削弱气候变化政策的有效性，也可能丧失通过贸易专业化带来的潜在收益。资源链接: The Interface Between theTradeand Climate Change Regimes: Scoping the Issues",

Agriculture and food industries tend to be more impeded by these barriers than other sectors.

Controlling for “multilateral resistance” lowers the propensity to find that these policies impede trade.

However, there is diverse perception of research in supply chain risk because these researchers have approached this area from different domains. This paper presents our study of this diversity from the perspectives of operations and supply chain management scholars: First, we reviewed the researchers’ output, i.e., the recent research literature. Next, we surveyed two focused groups (members of Supply Chain Thought Leaders and International Supply Chain Risk Management groups) with open-ended questions. Finally, we surveyed operations and supply chain management researchers during the 2009 INFORMS meeting in San Diego. Our findings characterize the diversity in terms of three “gaps”: a definition gap in how researchers define SCRM, a process gap in terms of inadequate coverage of response to risk incidents, and a methodology gap in terms of inadequate use of empirical methods. We also list ways to close these gaps as suggested by the researchers.供应链风险管理(SCRM)是一个新兴领域，源于实践者和研究者对供应链风险日益增长的重视。然而，由于研究者们从不同领域切入，对供应链风险研究的认知存在显著差异。本文从运营与供应链管理学者的视角出发，对这种差异性展开研究：首先梳理了研究者的产出——即近年来的学术文献；其次通过开放式问题调研了两个焦点小组（供应链思想领袖联盟和国际供应链风险管理小组成员）；最后在2009年圣地亚哥INFORMS会议期间对运营与供应链管理学者进行了问卷调查。研究发现这种差异性主要体现在三大”鸿沟”：研究者对SCRM定义的理解鸿沟、风险事件应对措施研究不足的过程鸿沟，以及实证方法运用不足的方法论鸿沟。文中同时列举了研究者提出的弥合这些鸿沟的途径。资源链接: Researchers’ Perspectives on Supply ChainRiskManagement",

        "author": "Marc Auboin",
        "tags": "Trade financing  cooperation with international financial institutions  coherence  G-2  financial crisis ",
        "content": "The paper discusses a number of issues related to the treatment of trade credit internationally, a priori (treatment by banking regulators) and a posteriori (treatment by debtors and creditors in the case of default), which are currently of interest to the trade finance community, in particular the traditional providers of trade credit and guarantees, such as banks, export credit agencies, regional development banks, and multilateral  agencies. The paper does not deal with the specific issue of regulation of official insured-export credit, under the OECD Arrangement, which is a specific matter left out of this analysis. Traditionally, trade finance has received preferred treatment on the part of national and international regulators, as well as by international financial agencies in the treatment of trade finance claims, on grounds that trade finance was one of the safest, most collateralized, and self-liquidating forms of trade finance. Preferred treatment of trade finance also reflects the systemic importance of trade, as in sovereign or private defaults a priority is to “treat” expeditiously trade lines of credits to allow for such credit to be restored and trade to flow again. It is not only a matter of urgency for essential imports to be financed, but also a pre-condition for economic recovery, as the resumption of trade is necessary for ailing countries to restore balance of payments equilibrium. The relatively favourable treatment received by trade finance was reflected in the moderate rate of capitalization for cross-border trade credit in the form of letters of credit and similar securitized instruments under the Basel I regulatory framework, put in place in the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, as the banking and regulatory communities moved towards internal-rating based and risk-weighted assets systems under the successor Basel II framework, a number of complaints emerged with respect to the treatment of trade credit – particularly in periods of crisis. Issues of pro-cyclicality, maturity structure and country risk have been discussed at some length in various fora, including in the WTO at the initiative of Members. Part of the issue was that Basel II regulation was designed and implemented in a manner that, in periods of banking retrenchment, seemed to have affected the supply of trade credit more than other potentially more risky forms of lending. With the collapse of trade in late 2008 and early 2009, the regulatory treatment of trade credit under Basel II clearly became an issue and was discussed by professional banking organizations, regulators and international financial institutions. A sentence made its headway into the communiqué of G-20 Leaders in London in April 2009, calling upon regulators to exercise some flexibility in the application of Basel II rules, in support of trade finance. As the issue of removing the obstacles to the supply of trade finance spread became part of the public debate, discussions with respect to the regulatory treatment of trade finance in the context of the making of “Basel III” rules are now raising political attention. Part of the underlying problem regarding the design of regulation of trade finance is that banking regulators may not have enough understanding of the way that trade and trade finance operate in practice. In turn, the banking community has made insufficient progress in explaining these issues to regulators and in providing evidence about the high level of safety and soundness of their activity, in collecting statistical information and even in defining clearly what comprises trade finance. This paper aims at clarifying such issues.  The WTO, in its role as an “honest broker”, is trying to help the parties concerned, and has been asked from time to time to act as a go-between between the two communities, in order to clarify issues. Section 1 looks at the overall Basel framework and its evolution over time, with particular emphasis on the regulation of trade finance. Section 2 looks at issues raised in the WTO context by the trading and trade finance communities, be it by WTO Members or by experts, and how this has helped to clarify some of the disputed issues. Section 3 raises a number of questions which need clarification from the trade finance community for regulators to be able to better capture the reality of trade finance operations, and allow them to regulate with full understanding of its implications.本文探讨了国际贸易信贷处理中的若干议题，包括事前（银行监管机构的处理方式）和事后（违约情况下债务人与债权人的处理方式），这些议题当前备受贸易金融界关注，尤其是传统贸易信贷与担保提供方，如银行、出口信用机构、区域开发银行及多边机构。本文不涉及经合组织安排下官方保险出口信贷的监管这一具体问题，该问题未被纳入本次分析范围。. . 传统上，贸易金融在国家及国际监管机构以及国际金融机构处理贸易金融债权时享有优先待遇，理由是贸易金融被视为最安全、最具抵押性且能自我清偿的贸易融资形式之一。这种优待也反映了贸易的系统重要性——当主权国家或私营部门违约时，优先”处理”贸易信贷额度以恢复信贷流动和贸易往来，不仅关乎紧急必需品的进口融资，更是经济复苏的前提条件，因为贸易恢复是困境国家重建国际收支平衡的必要条件。. . 这种相对优待体现在1980年代末至1990年代初实施的巴塞尔I框架下，信用证等证券化跨境贸易信贷工具适用的适度资本充足率要求。但随着银行业与监管界转向巴塞尔II框架下的内部评级与风险加权资产体系，关于贸易信贷处理的质疑开始浮现——尤其在危机时期。周期性、期限结构与国家风险等问题已在包括WTO成员发起的多边论坛中被广泛讨论。. . 部分问题在于巴塞尔II监管的设计与实施方式，在银行收缩时期似乎对贸易信贷供给的冲击大于其他风险更高的贷款形式。随着2008年末至2009年初的贸易崩溃，巴塞尔II下贸易信贷的监管处理明显成为银行专业组织、监管机构与国际金融机构的讨论焦点。2009年4月G20伦敦峰会公报特别提出，呼吁监管机构在实施巴塞尔II规则时保持灵活性以支持贸易金融。. . 随着消除贸易金融供给障碍成为公共辩论议题，围绕”巴塞尔III”规则制定中贸易金融监管处理的讨论正引发政治关注。监管设计中的根本问题在于：银行监管者可能对贸易及贸易金融的实际运作机制理解不足；而银行业在向监管者解释这些问题、提供业务安全稳健的证据、收集统计数据乃至明确定义贸易金融范畴等方面进展有限。. . 本文旨在澄清这些问题。作为”诚实中间人”的WTO正努力协助相关方，并时常受邀充当两大群体间的沟通桥梁。第一章概述巴塞尔框架及其演变，重点分析贸易金融监管；第二章考察WTO框架内贸易界与金融界（包括成员方与专家）提出的问题，及其对争议焦点的澄清作用；第三章提出需要贸易金融界澄清的若干问题，以帮助监管者更准确把握行业实况，实现基于充分认知的监管决策。资源链接: International Regulation and Treatment ofTradeFinance: What are the Issues?",

        "content": "This document assesses the economic impacts of a free trade agreement between Canada and Korea, using the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) CGE model and version 6 of its database (base year 2001). Five alternative scenarios are simulated based on a range of assumptions concerning the supply-side responses of the two economies to expanded bilateral trade. We find that choice of closure assumptions heavily influences the scale (and even the sign) of the welfare impacts and the breakdown of the economic impacts between output and terms of trade.  The default closure within the GTAP modelling framework of fixed labour and capital supply, which is equivalent to assuming zero supply elasticities for factor inputs, results in terms of trade gains dominating output gains, an outcome that in our view is unlikely for small, open economies like Canada and Korea. Our central scenario incorporates the assumptions which in our view are best suited for Canada and Korea respectively; this yields larger economic gains for both countries, with a more reasonable breakdown between output and terms of trade impacts.本文件运用全球贸易分析项目（GTAP）可计算一般均衡模型及其第六版数据库（基准年2001年），评估了加拿大与韩国自由贸易协定的经济影响。基于两国经济对双边贸易扩张供给侧反应的不同假设，我们模拟了五种替代情景。研究发现，闭合假设的选择显著影响福利效应的规模（甚至方向）以及产出与贸易条件经济效应的分布。GTAP建模框架默认采用劳动力和资本供给固定的闭合设定（相当于假设要素投入的供给弹性为零），这会导致贸易条件收益远大于产出收益——我们认为这种结果对加拿大、韩国这类小型开放经济体并不现实。我们的核心情景采用了分别最适合两国国情的假设，使双方获得更大的经济收益，同时产出与贸易条件影响的分布也更为合理。资源链接: Preliminary Assessment of the Economic Impacts of a Canada-Korea FreeTradeAgreement",

        "content": "The paper investigates the role of global supply chains in explaining the trade collapse of 2008-2009 and the long-term variations observed in trade elasticity. Building on the empirical results obtained from a subset of input-output matrices and the exploratory analysis of a large and diversified sample of countries, a formal model is specified to measure the respective short-term and long-term dynamics of trade elasticity. The model is then used to formally probe the role of vertical integration in explaining changes in trade elasticity. Aggregated results on long-term trade elasticity tend to support the hypothesis that world economy has undertaken in the late 1980s a “traverse” between two underlying economic models. During this transition, the expansion of international supply chains determined an apparent increase in trade elasticity. Two supply chains related effects (the composition and the bullwhip effects) explain also the overshooting of trade elasticity that occurred during the 2008-2009 trade collapse. But vertical specialization is unable to explain the heterogeneity observed on a country and sectoral level, indicating that other contributive factors may also have been at work to explain the diversity of the observed results.该论文探讨了全球供应链在解释2008-2009年贸易崩溃及贸易弹性长期变化中的作用。基于部分投入产出矩阵的实证结果和对多样化国家样本的探索性分析，研究构建了一个正式模型来衡量贸易弹性的短期与长期动态变化。随后通过该模型系统检验了垂直整合对贸易弹性变化的解释力。长期贸易弹性的汇总结果支持了世界经济在1980年代末经历两种基本经济模式”跨越”的假说。在此转型期间，国际供应链的扩张导致了贸易弹性的表面增长。两个与供应链相关的效应（结构效应和牛鞭效应）也解释了2008-2009年贸易崩溃期间贸易弹性的超调现象。但垂直专业化无法解释国家与行业层面观察到的异质性，这表明其他影响因素可能也在导致观测结果多样性方面发挥了作用。资源链接: International Supply Chains andTradeElasticity In Times of Global Crisis",

        "content": "Tobacco manufacturers have targeted youth for decades in the marketing of tobacco products.  Their continuation of such practices, despite the prohibition against youth marketing under the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (“MSA”) between state attorneys general and the five largest tobacco manufacturers, does not come as a surprise to many public health and tobacco control advocates.  Since the signing of the MSA, state attorneys general have investigated and prosecuted numerous violations.  Still, the brazen approach some manufacturers have taken to market candy and fruit-flavored tobacco products in a manner that targets youth is astounding.  This law synopsis explores legal approaches for addressing the marketing and sale of flavored tobacco products to youth.  Section I describes various types of flavored tobacco products and reviews current evidence that the marketing of these products, as well as the products themselves, target youth.  Internal tobacco industry documents provide some answers as to why manufacturers have developed these new products.  Section II introduces one possible legal approach, MSA enforcement.   Section III focuses on legislative initiatives, such as Food and Drug Administration oversight of tobacco products, and state legislative initiatives, with particular attention paid to the State of Maine’s law prohibiting the sale of flavored cigarettes, which took effect January 1, 2009.  The experiences involved in passing the Maine Law provide an initial model for public health law development in this area.  Section III concludes with recommendations for refining the Maine Law.  It should be noted that although the design and marketing of menthol tobacco products may also increase youth smoking rates, this synopsis focuses on the less traditional flavored cigarettes, including candy, fruit and alcohol-flavored tobacco products. Editor’s Note:  This publication was prepared in February 2009, prior to the June 2009 passage of the Family Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, giving the U.S. Food and Drug Administration comprehensive authority to regulate the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of tobacco products.  Under this Act, cigarettes that contain flavors other than tobacco or menthol may not be sold, distributed or manufactured in the U.S., effective September 22, 2009.烟草制造商数十年来一直将青少年作为烟草产品的营销目标。尽管1998年各州总检察长与五大烟草制造商达成的《总和解协议》（MSA）禁止针对青少年的营销行为，但许多公共卫生和控烟倡导者对这些企业继续此类做法并不感到意外。自MSA签署以来，州总检察长已调查并起诉了多起违规案件。然而，某些制造商肆无忌惮地通过糖果和水果味烟草产品针对青少年进行营销的手段仍令人震惊。本法律概要探讨了解决向青少年营销和销售调味烟草产品的法律途径。第一部分描述了各类调味烟草产品，并回顾了当前证据，表明这些产品的营销手段及产品本身均以青少年为目标。烟草业内部文件为制造商开发这些新产品的原因提供了一些答案。第二部分介绍了MSA执法这一可能的法律途径。第三部分聚焦立法举措，包括美国食品药品监督管理局对烟草产品的监管及各州立法行动，其中特别关注缅因州自2009年1月1日起生效的禁止销售调味香烟法律。缅因州立法过程中的经验为该领域公共卫生法律的发展提供了初步范本。第三部分最后提出了完善缅因州法律的建议。需要说明的是，虽然薄荷味烟草产品的设计和营销也可能提高青少年吸烟率，但本概要主要关注非传统口味的香烟，包括糖果味、水果味和酒味烟草产品。编者注：本出版物完成于2009年2月，早于2009年6月通过的《家庭预防与烟草控制法》。该法案授权美国食品药品监督管理局全面监管烟草产品的生产、营销和销售。根据该法案，自2009年9月22日起，美国禁止销售、分销或生产含有烟草或薄荷以外口味的香烟。资源链接: Pick Your Poison: Responses to the Marketing and Sale of Flavored Tobacco Products",

        "content": "Trade can be a powerful engine for economic growth, poverty reduction, and development. However, harnessing the power of trade is often difficult for developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, because of supply-side domestic constraints (lack of trade-related infrastructure and capacity). The Aid for Trade Initiative was launched to address these constraints. This paper sets forth strategies to identify the most binding constraints to trade expansion so countries and donors can channel resources toward reforms and projects that have the largest effect. It shows that the four most common objectives of aid-for-trade projects (increasing trade, diversifying exports, maximizing the linkages with the domestic economy, and increasing adjustment capacity) have the potential to boost growth and reduce poverty in developing countries. However, the potential of trade may not be realized as developing countries often face binding constraints that prevent them from turning trade opportunities into trade, and trade into growth. First, they face difficulties turning trade opportunities into trade flows because of capacity constraints and lack of adequate trade-related infrastructure. Second, some domestic constraints choke the impact of trade expansion on economic growth. The paper focuses on the first set of constraints and presents various diagnostic tools available to identify them. These tools often pinpoint a long list of constraints. As all constraints cannot be addressed simultaneously, there is a need to identify the most binding ones in order to prioritize reforms. The paper suggests combining the different diagnostic tools in an appropriate framework to achieve this prioritization. An adaptation of the growth diagnostics can be such a framework. By shifting the focus from growth to trade, this framework can be readily adapted by local authorities and development practitioners.贸易可以成为经济增长、减贫和发展的强大引擎。然而，发展中国家尤其是最不发达国家由于供给侧国内制约因素（缺乏与贸易相关的基础设施和能力），往往难以发挥贸易的推动作用。”贸易援助倡议”正是为应对这些制约因素而启动。本文提出了一系列识别贸易扩张最紧迫制约因素的策略，以便各国和捐助方将资源投向能产生最大效果的改革和项目。研究表明，贸易援助项目最常见的四大目标（扩大贸易规模、促进出口多元化、最大化与国内经济的联动效应、提升调整适应能力）有望推动发展中国家经济增长并减少贫困。但贸易潜力可能无法充分释放，因为这些国家常面临刚性约束，使其难以将贸易机遇转化为实际贸易活动，再将贸易转化为经济增长。首先，受能力限制和贸易基础设施不足影响，他们难以将贸易机会转变为贸易流量；其次，部分国内制约因素削弱了贸易扩张对经济增长的促进作用。本文重点探讨第一类制约因素，介绍了多种可用于识别这些问题的诊断工具。这些工具通常会列出一长串制约因素，由于无法同时解决所有问题，必须识别最关键的制约因素以确定改革优先级。文章建议在适当框架内综合运用不同诊断工具来实现优先排序，调整后的”增长诊断法”可作为此类框架。通过将关注点从增长转向贸易，该框架能方便地被当地政府和发展实践者采用。资源链接: Binding Constraints toTradeExpansion: Aid forTradeObjectives and Diagnostics Tools",

        "content": "This paper investigates the efficient design of rules on domestic subsidies in a trade agreement. A clear trade-off emerges from the economic literature. Weak rules may lead Member governments to inefficiently use domestic subsidies for redistributive purposes or to lower market access granted to trading partners once tariffs are bound. On the other hand, excessive rigidity may inhibit tariff negotiations or induce governments to set inefficiently high tariffs, as strict regulations would reduce policy makers’ ability to use subsidies to offset domestic market distortions. Efficient subsidy rules are, therefore, the ones that strike the right balance between policy flexibility and rigidity. This economic approach provides a framework to interpret the provisions on domestic subsidies in the WTO.本文探讨了贸易协定中关于国内补贴规则的高效设计。经济学文献揭示了一个明显的权衡问题：宽松的规则可能导致成员国政府为再分配目的低效使用补贴，或在关税受限后降低给予贸易伙伴的市场准入；而过度严格的规则则会抑制关税谈判，或促使政府设定低效的高关税，因为严苛的监管将削弱政策制定者运用补贴纠正国内市场扭曲的能力。因此，高效的补贴规则应在政策灵活性与刚性之间取得恰当平衡。这一经济学视角为解读世贸组织国内补贴条款提供了分析框架。资源链接: The Value of Domestic Subsidy Rules inTradeAgreements",

        "content": "This paper presents the results of a four-year project tackling several issues relating to multilateral and preferential trade in services. One of the underlying organising principles of our research on services trade has been a presumed fault line between the innate coherence that is achieved through multilateral rules and commitments, on the one side, and the more inherently fragmented nature of preferential solutions or rules, on the other. Doubtlessly rooted in the way mainstream trade theorists and economists more broadly have long championed multilateralism over its peripheral brethren, such a perception proceeds from the assumed second-best nature of preferential, or non-WTO-centric, policy and rule-making approaches. Our key messages put forward concrete proposals to improve regulation of services trade. We find, inter alia, that: a) fragmentation is a source of policy and innovation apt to inform multilateral rule-making, while theatres at the periphery may yield superior outcomes or more politically palatable bargains; b) the adoption of a necessity test applicable across services sectors at the multilateral level would improve the quality of services trade regulation domestically; c) the current treatment of labour mobility under GATS is not conducive to an optimal global governance of migration; d) when examing likeness, both service-related and supplier-related factors have to be considered to decide whether there is competitive relationship in the marketplace; e) Overlapping multilateral and bilateral rules on investment blur the rights and obligations of domestic authorities and foreign investors in services; f) co-ordination between the WTO and arbitral panels so that similar principles are intepreted in a uniform manner can lead to a more coherent international investment framework in services.本文展示了一项为期四年的研究成果，该项目致力于解决与服务领域多边及优惠贸易相关的若干问题。我们研究服务贸易的基本组织原则之一，是假定多边规则与承诺所达成的内在一致性，与优惠解决方案或规则固有的碎片化特性之间存在分界线。这种认知无疑源于主流贸易理论家及更广泛经济学界长期推崇多边主义而非边缘化替代方案的传统，其逻辑起点在于将优惠性或非WTO核心的政策规则制定路径视为次优选择。我们的核心主张提出了改进服务贸易监管的具体建议，主要发现包括：a) 碎片化现象能催生政策创新，为多边规则制定提供借鉴，而边缘化试验场可能产生更优成果或更易被政治接纳的妥协方案；b) 在多边层面实施跨服务部门的必要性测试将提升国内服务贸易监管质量；c) 现行GATS对劳动力流动的规制不利于实现全球移民治理的最优化；d) 判定市场竞争力关系时需同时考量服务特性与供应商特性；e) 多边与双边投资规则的重叠模糊了服务业中国内监管机构与外国投资者的权责边界；f) 通过WTO与仲裁庭的协调机制实现原则解释的一致性，可构建更连贯的国际服务业投资框架。资源链接: DevelopingTradeRules for Services: A Case of Fragmented Coherence?",

        "content": "Trade in agriculture is linked to a whole range of economic, environmental, societal and future interests. For this reason, international regulation of trade in agricultural goods is highly contentious. While mainly directed towards an opening of markets, the WTO Agreement on Agriculture also has some entry points for ‘non trade concerns’. However, the agreement still looks like a casual patchwork that allows rather unsystematically for exemptions, without explicitly exposing the grounds that allow for them. The question arises of how the agreement could be drafted in a more structured way, in order to make sure that the economic objectives are efficiently pursued, and at the same time that human rights and environmental concerns are adequately taken account of‘ The concept of sustainable development provides for a methodical ‘seven step’ framework that gives guidance on integrated decision making processes. In this paper, this framework is partially applied to the Agreement on Agriculture. This working paper served as an introductory note to a brainstorming workshop on the subject that took place on 27 March 2009 at the World Trade Institute, University of Bern.农产品贸易涉及一系列经济、环境、社会及未来利益。正因如此，国际农产品贸易监管始终存在高度争议。虽然《WTO农业协定》主要旨在推动市场开放，但也为”非贸易关切”设置了若干入口条款。不过该协定仍显得零散拼凑，其豁免条款缺乏系统性安排，亦未明确阐述豁免依据。由此引发的问题是：如何以更具结构性的方式重新拟定协定，在有效实现经济目标的同时，充分兼顾人权与环境关切？可持续发展概念提供的”七步法”框架，为综合决策流程提供了方法论指导。本文将该框架部分应用于《农业协定》分析。本工作论文系2009年3月27日伯尔尼大学世界贸易研究所专题研讨会的引言文件。资源链接: Towards a New Balance ofTradein Agriculture",

The present paper aims to consider a class of stochastic models in severity and risk duration reduction operations. Design/Methodology/Approach - A new stochastic model is formulated which is shown to be of some importance in fundamental risk management operations. The investigation of such a model is based on classical methods of characteristic functions theory. Findings - A stochastic model having the form of the product of two nonnegative and independent random variables is formulated. A characterization of the distribution of such a model is established. Moreover, applications of the proposed stochastic model in risk control programs of organizations are provided. Research limitations/implications - The difficulty of evaluating the corresponding distribution function, which extends the practical applicability of the proposed stochastic model still remains.   Originality/Value - The formulated stochastic model consists a strong analytical tool for investigating operations of risk control programs.目的 - 现代复杂组织的风险控制程序广泛运用随机模型。本文旨在探讨一类用于降低风险严重程度和缩短风险持续期操作的随机模型。设计/方法论/途径 - 本研究构建了一个新随机模型，该模型在基础风险管理操作中具有重要价值。基于特征函数理论的经典方法对该模型进行了研究。研究结果 - 构建了一个由两个非负独立随机变量乘积构成的随机模型，确立了该模型分布特征的表征方法，并提供了该随机模型在组织风险控制程序中的实际应用案例。研究局限/启示 - 评估对应分布函数的难度仍然存在，这在一定程度上限制了所提出随机模型的实际应用范围。原创性/价值 - 所构建的随机模型为研究风险控制程序的操作提供了强有力的分析工具。资源链接: Stochastic Models forRiskControlPrograms of Organizations",

It aims to provide theoretical evidence of the changes adopted in the terms of trade structure from implementing SPS Measures. The paper explores how European Agricultural Trade volumes have changed. Producing at SPS measure requirements, lead to an increase in costs, while it may be a small proportion of the value-added to the final value, it still will have an affect upon the bilateral Terms of Trade Agreement. An assessment is made upon the risk of compliance using a Cost-Benefit analysis to evaluate the costs of implementing SPS measures. Also incorporating an inventory approach, the extent of SPS measure distortion is assessed. The consequence of the distortion may be seen with the loss of comparative advantages and the movement towards other products.《卫生与植物检疫（SPS）协定》引发了人们对其扭曲贸易的担忧。自实施SPS措施以来，贸易扭曲的价值日益受到关注，这些价值通过采用合格贸易量来评估，即在采用SPS措施之前和之后估计国家间贸易条件的变化。本文基于理论假设，评估了欧洲成员国与其贸易伙伴之间高价值农产品的情况。其目的是为实施SPS措施后贸易条件结构变化提供理论证据。本文探讨了欧洲农产品贸易量的变化。按照SPS措施要求生产会导致成本增加，虽然这可能只是最终价值增值的一小部分，但仍会对双边贸易条件协定产生影响。通过成本效益分析评估了实施SPS措施的成本，从而对合规风险进行了评估。同时结合清单方法，评估了SPS措施扭曲的程度。这种扭曲的后果可能表现为比较优势的丧失以及向其他产品的转移。资源链接: Distortion to Terms ofTradethrough SPSMeasures",

No country of the world is self-sufficient; everyone has some advantages and disadvantages. People once used to share their strengths and weaknesses with others for the sake of peaceful living. The modern system of this sharing is multilateral trading system under the umbrella of WTO or regional trade agreement like the EU, ASEAN, SAFTA, APTA, etc. As multilateral trade negotiation in the WTO is getting delayed because of so many issues, countries are moving to regional free trade arrangements, even bilateral free trade arrangements, to make to process quicker. With the same end in view, Bangladesh-Myanmar Joint Trade Commission (JTC) was formed in 2003 to promote mutual trade and investment among us. In the meantime, two meetings of this JTC were held and some very important trade related issues were initiated in those meetings. But until now, none of the issues has been finalized. We must remember that, in this age of ITC, no opportunity will wait for any one. If someone fails to take the opportunity in time, we must see that it has been taken by any other else. The problems and issues involved in Bangladesh-Myanmar trade negotiation are about: L/C opening Transportation. Mutual exchange of gas and fertilizer issue.

This paper shows the extent of overlap between a broad-based view of risk management, namely Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), and the balanced scorecard, which is a widely used strategic control system. A case study of one of the UK’s largest retailers, Tesco plc, is used to show how ERM can be introduced as part of an existing strategic control system. The case demonstrates that, despite some differences in lines of communications, the strategic controls and risk controls can be used to achieve a common objective. Adoption of such an integrated approach, however, has implications for the profile of risk and the overall risk culture within an organisation.关于风险管理角色与风格以及绩效管理/战略控制系统的定义和认知虽历经演变，但可以说风险管理的核心在于确保战略目标的实现。本文通过英国最大零售商乐购公司的案例研究，展现了广义风险管理（即企业风险管理ERM）与广泛应用的战略控制系统平衡计分卡之间的交叉程度，揭示如何将ERM纳入现有战略控制系统。案例表明，尽管沟通路径存在差异，战略控制与风险控制仍可协同实现共同目标。但采用这种整合方法将对组织内部的风险定位及整体风险文化产生影响。资源链接: LinkingRiskManagementto Strategic Controls: A Case Study of Tesco Plc",

Tactical approaches focus on particular models (VaR, option theory, fault trees, etc.) while strategic approaches take an enlarged view of key managerial and contextual factors which shape the actual use of risk management.

Our contribution is twofold: first, extending the specification and estimation procedure for the model, and then estimating on a dataset of European institutions, spanning major turmoil episodes in the past two decades. Operational risk is evaluated individually for each institution, by regressing monthly stock returns on proxies that capture institutions exposure to market and credit risks.

We first examine the relations between internal control weaknesses and audit fee, audit fee increase, modified opinion, and auditor resignation, respectively, and establish that these are viable strategies to manage control risk on a stand-alone basis.  When we investigate these strategies simultaneously, descriptive evidence suggests that there exists a pecking order among auditors’ client risk management strategies.  Our ordered logit analyses document that, as the clients’ control risk increases, auditors are likely to respond in the order of audit fee adjustments, modified opinions, and auditor resignations.  We further create an index based on the severity of auditors’ responses, and find that the degree of control risk is positively correlated with this auditor response index.  Our comprehensive evidence suggests that auditors use an array of ordered strategies to manage client-related control risk.我们研究了《萨班斯-奥克斯利法案》404条款实施首年审计师的客户风险管理行为，发现审计师针对内部控制缺陷引发的控制风险存在层级化的管理策略。首先分别检验了内部控制缺陷与审计费用、审计费用增长、非标准审计意见及审计师辞任之间的关系，证实这些策略单独运用时均可有效管理控制风险。当我们同步考察这些策略时，描述性证据表明审计师的客户风险管理策略存在优先顺序。有序逻辑回归分析显示，随着客户控制风险上升，审计师可能依次采取审计费用调整、出具非标准意见和终止审计合约的应对措施。我们进一步根据审计师反应强度构建指数，发现控制风险程度与该反应指数呈正相关。综合证据表明，审计师采用了一系列有序策略来管理客户相关的控制风险。资源链接: InternalControlWeaknesses and ClientRiskManagement",

Our paper offers an analysis of the structure and the importance of these measures in agricultural trade. We cover all notifying countries and products at the HS6 digit level. Results of the inventory approach show that EU countries have the lowest coverage ratios of all OECD countries except South Korea and Turkey. Using gravity equation, we also estimate the stringency of such measures. In contrast with previous works, our equation controls for the bilateral applied tariff protection and uses ad valorem equivalents of SPS and TBT measures. Our results first suggest that these measures have on the whole a negative impact on OECD imports. When we consider different groups of exporting countries, we show that OECD exporters are not significantly affected by SPS and TBTs in their exports to other OECD countries while developing and least developed countries’ exports are negatively and significantly affected. Furthermore, EU imports seem to be more negatively influenced by tariffs and SPS &amp; TBTs than imports of other OECD countries. Finally, our sectoral analysis suggests an equal distribution of negative and positive impacts of NTBs on agricultural trade.根据世贸组织规则，各国可依据《卫生与植物检疫措施协定》（SPS）和《技术性贸易壁垒协定》（TBT）制定法规，以保护人类、动植物健康及环境、野生动植物和人类安全。本文分析了这些措施在农产品贸易中的结构及重要性，涵盖所有通报国及HS六位码商品。清单分析法结果显示，除韩国和土耳其外，欧盟国家在经合组织中的措施覆盖率最低。通过引力模型，我们还评估了此类措施的严格程度。与既往研究不同，本模型控制了双边适用关税保护水平，并采用SPS与TBT措施的从价税等值。研究首先表明，这些措施总体上对经合组织进口呈负面影响。按出口国分组分析显示，经合组织成员对同体系国家的出口未受SPS与TBT显著影响，而发展中国家和最不发达国家出口则遭受显著负面冲击。此外，欧盟进口受关税及SPS与TBT的负面影响较其他经合组织国家更为显著。最后，部门分析表明非关税壁垒对农业贸易的负面与正面影响分布均衡。资源链接: The Impact of Regulations on AgriculturalTrade: Evidence from SPS and TBT Agreements",

We conduct an experiment in which we manipulate provision of information about an internal control material weakness. We find that when fraud risk is heightened by provision of material weakness information, audit seniors’ programs are of lower quality. This occurs because these auditors tend to propose audit program modifications that are not effective in detecting the fraud, resulting in programs that are less efficient. We also investigate determinants of higher quality audit programs, finding that program quality increases as auditors identify more risk factors focused on the specific fraud. These results suggest that identifying risk factors focused on the fraud area is critical to the development of high quality audit plans, and thus to fraud detection.本文探讨了在存在具体欺诈假设线索的情况下，审计高级人员如何针对升高的欺诈风险修改标准审计程序。我们通过实验操纵了内部控制重大缺陷信息的提供，发现当重大缺陷信息提高欺诈风险时，审计高级人员制定的程序质量较低。这是因为这些审计师倾向于提出无法有效发现欺诈的程序修改方案，导致程序效率下降。我们还研究了高质量审计程序的决定因素，发现当审计师识别出更多针对特定欺诈的风险因素时，程序质量会提高。这些结果表明，聚焦于欺诈领域的风险因素识别对于制定高质量审计计划及发现欺诈至关重要。资源链接: How Do Audit Seniors Respond to Heightened FraudRisk?",

        "content": "We start by presenting a reduced-form multiple default type of model and derive abstract results on the influence of a state variable X on credit spreads, when both the intensity and the loss quota distribution are driven by X. The aim is to apply the results to a concrete real life situation, namely, to the influence of macroeconomic risks on credit spreads term structures. There has been increasing support in the empirical literature that both the probability of default (PD) and the loss given default (LGD) are correlated and driven by macroeconomic variables. Paradoxically, there has been very little effort from the theoretical literature to develop credit risk models that would include this possibility. A possible justification has to do with the increase in complexity this leads to, even for the “treatable” default intensity models. The goal of this paper is to develop the theoretical framework needed to handle this situation and, through numerical simulation, understand the impact on credit risk term structures of the macroeconomic risks. In the proposed model the state of the economy is modeled trough the dynamics of a market index, that enters directly on the functional form of both the intensity of default and the distribution of the loss quota q given default. Given this setup, we are able to make periods of economic depression, periods of higher default intensity as well as periods where low recovery is more likely, producing a business cycle effect. Furthermore, we allow for the possibility of an index volatility that depends negatively on the index level and show that, when we include this realistic feature, the impacts on the credit spread term structure are emphasized.我们首先提出一个简化形式的多重违约类型模型，并推导出当违约强度和损失配额分布均受状态变量X驱动时，X对信用利差影响的抽象结果。目的是将这些结果应用于具体的现实情境，即宏观经济风险对信用利差期限结构的影响。实证文献日益支持违约概率（PD）和违约损失率（LGD）存在相关性且均受宏观经济变量驱动的观点。然而矛盾的是，理论文献却极少致力于开发包含这种可能性的信用风险模型。一个可能的解释在于，即便对于”可处理”的违约强度模型，这也会导致复杂性增加。本文目标是构建处理这种情况所需的理论框架，并通过数值模拟来理解宏观经济风险对信用风险期限结构的影响。在所提出的模型中，经济状态通过市场指数的动态变化来建模，该指数直接进入违约强度函数和违约条件下损失配额q的分布函数。基于此设置，我们能够模拟经济萧条时期——这些时期不仅违约强度更高，且低回收率的可能性更大，从而产生商业周期效应。此外，我们允许指数波动率与指数水平呈负相关，并证明当加入这一现实特征时，对信用利差期限结构的影响会被放大。资源链接: On Recovery and Intensity’s Correlation - A New Class of CreditRiskModels",

        "content": "Risk characteristics of the Korean financial market have changed dramatically during the decade following the financial crisis in 1997. First of all, credit risk in the large corporate sector has decreased significantly after turmoil in the corporate bond market in 1999 and 2000. Second, credit risk in the small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) sector has been continuously deteriorating. Third, credit risk in the household sector has increased. Over-supply of credit by large financial institutions in early 2000s had created near crisis in this sector in 2003. The market stabilized rather quickly, but fast increase of residential mortgage loans by commercial banks had triggered new concerns in recent years. Korean financial institutions have in general made remarkable progresses in improving risk management practices. The supervisory authorities (FSC/FSS) had exerted very strong influences on financial institutions to prompt improvements in their risk management functions. As a result, many of the large financial institutions have made noticeable progresses in adopting advanced risk management technologies and risk-based decision making procedures, even medium- and small-sized financial institutions have been rather slow in progress. Due to lack of experience and insufficient dada, however, many financial institutions are still struggling to fully utilize new risk management technologies. Proactive supervisory measures have become ever more important to maintain soundness and safety of the financial system, because most of large financial institutions still pursue similar asset-origination strategies. Early adoption of Basel II and similar risk-based supervisory criteria and strict implementation of Pillar 3 will be essential to maintain stability of the financial markets. Expanding the pool of risk management professionals is also a task that should not be ignored.1997年金融危机后的十年间，韩国金融市场的风险特征发生了显著变化。首先，1999年至2000年公司债券市场动荡后，大型企业部门的信用风险显著降低。其次，中小型企业（SMEs）部门的信用风险持续恶化。第三，家庭部门的信用风险有所上升。2000年代初大型金融机构的信贷过度供应导致该部门在2003年几近危机。市场虽迅速企稳，但近年来商业银行住房抵押贷款的快速增长引发了新的担忧。韩国金融机构在改进风险管理实践方面总体取得显著进展。监管机构（FSC/FSS）对金融机构施加了强大影响，推动其风险管理职能的改善。因此，许多大型金融机构在采用先进风险管理技术和基于风险的决策流程方面进步明显，而中小型金融机构进展相对缓慢。但由于经验不足和数据缺失，许多机构仍难以充分运用新型风险管理技术。鉴于多数大型金融机构仍采取相似的资产配置策略，采取前瞻性监管措施对维持金融体系稳健与安全愈发重要。尽早实施《巴塞尔协议II》等基于风险的监管标准，严格执行第三支柱要求，对保持金融市场稳定至关重要。扩大风险管理专业人才储备同样是不容忽视的任务。资源链接: RiskManagementin Korean Financial Institutions: Ten Years after the Financial Crisis",

        "content": "During each phase of the audit members of the engagement team pose numerous questions, the answers to which may affect both the course and outcome of the audit. The authors posit that an understanding of the psychology of lying may provide auditors with an additional tool with which to evaluate verbal responses to audit inquiries and thereby lessen detection risk. A large body of literature suggests that people are only about 4% better than chance at identifying deception. Additionally, most people hold stereotypical views about the indicators of deception, such as a lack of eye contact indicates deception. Unfortunately, research has found many of these stereotypical views to be invalid indicators of deception. The paper concludes by exploring 6 guidelines that may assist auditors in making more accurate judgments of truth or deception.在审计的每个阶段，项目组成员会提出大量问题，这些问题的答案可能影响审计的进程和结果。作者认为，理解说谎心理可以为审计师提供额外的工具，用以评估对审计询问的口头回应，从而降低检查风险。大量文献表明，人们在识别欺骗方面的准确率仅比随机猜测高出约4%。此外，大多数人对欺骗的指示持有刻板印象，例如缺乏眼神接触意味着欺骗。遗憾的是，研究发现许多这类刻板印象并非有效的欺骗指标。本文最后探讨了六条准则，可能帮助审计师更准确地判断真伪。资源链接: Audit Inquiries and DeceptionDetection: Standards, Research, and Guidance",

        "content": "The Netherlands is highly dependent on international trade for its  economic prosperity. Successive Dutch governments have, therefore, always supported the further liberalization of international trade. At the same time, the public debate on economic globalization and international trade reveals that citizens as well as policy makers fear the corrosive impact of international trade on the core societal values on which Dutch society is founded. They fear that international trade, in particular a further liberalization thereof, may undermine or put at risk policies and measures for the protection of public health, the environment, labour rights, social welfare, good governance, national security, cultural identity, food safety, access to knowledge, consumer interests and animal welfare. There is a general consensus in the Netherlands that these non-trade concerns (NTC’s), which cover very different societal aspirations and fears, must be addressed in Dutch government policy and measures relating to international trade. Many of the trade measures introduced by developed countries to address non-trade concerns have been met by developing countries with much suspicion and opposition. Developing countries often suspect that such measures are inspired by protectionist motives and intentions, rather than genuine non-trade concerns. Moreover, developing countries perceive these measures as an attempt by developed countries to impose their social, ethical or cultural values and preferences on exporting developing countries. Over the last two years, the debate in the Netherlands on trade measures addressing non-trade concerns has focused on two important and politically sensitive issues, namely:   the sustainability of the large-scale production of biomass as an alternative source of energy; and   the production of livestock products in a manner that is consistent with animal welfare requirements. With regard to the first issue  sustainable biomass production  in February 2007 the Project Group Duurzame Productie van Biomassa, a commission established by the government and chaired by Jacqueline Cramer (hereinafter the ‘Cramer Commission’), issued a report on the Toetsingskader voor Duurzame Biomassa (hereinafter the ‘Cramer Report’). This report discusses the risks associated with large-scale biomass production and establishes a list of criteria for the sustainable production of biomass. These criteria (hereinafter the ‘Cramer sustainability criteria’) reflect a broad range of non-trade concerns, including environmental protection, global warming, food security, biodiversity, economic prosperity and social welfare. The Cramer Report invites the Dutch government to give effect to the Cramer sustainability criteria by incorporating them into relevant policy. The report recognizes, however, that the implementation of the Cramer sustainability criteria (including the establishment of a certification system) will require careful consideration of the obligations of the Netherlands under EU and WTO law. With regard to the second issue  animal welfare  modern methods of intensive agricultural production have generated, especially in Europe, increased concern about the treatment of farm animals, in particular with regard to their housing, nutrition, transportation and slaughter. Individual EU Member States, including the Netherlands, as well the EU itself, have adopted wide-ranging animal welfare legislation. Governments called upon to address non-trade concerns may do so by using different types of measures. Prominent among these are measures concerning processes and production methods of products. These measures may concern either:   product-related processes and production methods (PR PPMs), i.e. measures that prescribe processes and production methods that affect the characteristics of products (e.g. measures prohibiting the use of growth hormones for cattle in the production of meat, or prohibiting the use of pesticides in the production of vegetables); or   non-product-related processes and production methods (nPR PPMs), i.e. measures that prescribe processes and production methods that do not, or in a negligible manner only, affect the characteristics of the products (e.g. a measure requiring that tuna fishing vessels use dolphin-friendly nets). The second type of measure, i.e. measures concerning nPR PPMs, is  much more than measures concerning PR PPMs  the subject of controversy. Pursuant to its terms of reference, this study therefore focuses on three main issues relating to unilateral non-product-related PPM measures addressing non-trade concerns, namely:   the consistency of unilateral nPR PPM measures addressing non-trade concerns with the obligations under the WTO Agreement (see Part 1);   the relevance of other international agreements for unilateral nPR PPM measures addressing non-trade concerns (see Part 2); and    the economic effectiveness and efficiency, as well as the impact on developing countries, of unilateral nPR PPM measures addressing non-trade concerns. In the present study, these issues are examined primarily with regard to existing, proposed or still purely hypothetical measures for implementing the Cramer criteria for the sustainable production of biomass, or measures for the protection and promotion of animal welfare.荷兰的经济繁荣高度依赖国际贸易。因此，历届荷兰政府始终支持进一步推动国际贸易自由化。与此同时，关于经济全球化与国际贸易的公共讨论显示，民众和政策制定者都担忧国际贸易会侵蚀荷兰社会赖以建立的核心价值观。他们担心国际贸易——尤其是进一步自由化——可能损害或危及旨在保护公共卫生、环境、劳工权利、社会福利、良政、国家安全、文化认同、食品安全、知识获取、消费者利益及动物福利的政策措施。荷兰社会普遍共识认为，这些涵盖多元社会诉求与忧虑的非贸易关切事项（NTC’s），必须在政府涉及国际贸易的政策与措施中得到处理。. . 发达国家为应对非贸易关切出台的许多贸易措施，常引发发展中国家的强烈质疑与反对。发展中国家往往认为这些措施源于保护主义动机，而非真正的非贸易关切，并视其为发达国家试图将自身社会、伦理或文化价值观强加于出口型发展中国家。过去两年间，荷兰国内关于应对非贸易关切的贸易措施争论聚焦于两大政治敏感议题：一是作为替代能源的大规模生物质生产的可持续性；二是符合动物福利要求的畜产品生产方式。. . 针对生物质可持续生产议题，2007年2月，由政府设立、杰奎琳·克拉默（以下简称”克拉默委员会”）领导的”可持续生物质生产项目组”发布了《可持续生物质认证框架》报告（以下简称《克拉默报告》）。该报告分析了大规模生物质生产的风险，并制定了一套可持续生产标准（以下简称”克拉默可持续标准”），涵盖环境保护、全球变暖、粮食安全、生物多样性、经济繁荣及社会福利等广泛非贸易关切。报告建议政府将标准纳入相关政策，但强调实施过程（包括认证体系建立）需审慎考量荷兰在欧盟与WTO框架下的义务。. . 关于动物福利议题，现代农业集约化生产方式（尤其在欧洲）引发对农场动物待遇的深切关注，涉及饲养、运输、屠宰等环节。荷兰等欧盟成员国及欧盟层面已通过综合性动物福利立法。. . 政府处理非贸易关切时可采取不同类型措施，其中关于产品加工与生产方法（PPMs）的措施尤为突出。这类措施分为两类：一是影响产品特性的生产加工方法（PR PPMs），如禁止肉类生产使用生长激素或蔬菜种植使用农药；二是不影响（或可忽略影响）产品特性的生产加工方法（nPR PPMs），如要求金枪鱼捕捞船使用海豚友好型渔网。后者比前者更具争议性。. . 本研究据此聚焦于单边非产品相关PPM措施应对非贸易关切的三大核心问题：一是此类措施与WTO协定义务的一致性（见第一部分）；二是其他国际协定对此类措施的相关性（见第二部分）；三是此类措施的经济效能及对发展中国家的影响。研究主要结合实施克拉默生物质可持续标准（现有/拟议/假设性措施）及动物福利保护措施展开分析。资源链接: UnilateralMeasuresAdressing Non-TradeConcerns",

In this paper, we add an exit option, the right of early termination, to the standard agency model for employment contracts. We address two questions: (1) Who should have this right? (2) What is the effect of its inclusion in a contract? Under risk neutrality, we find that (1) it does not matter for investments and economic efficiency to whom this right belongs, although it may affect con-tractual terms and income sharing, and (2) although the allocation of this right does not mat-ter, its inclusion can have either a positive or a negative effect on economic efficiency. Our analysis provides a benchmark for more general studies on control rights under risk aversion.控制权的分配是不完全合同中的一个关键问题。本文在标准雇佣合同代理模型中引入了退出选择权——提前终止权。我们探讨了两个问题：（1）谁应拥有这一权利？（2）将该权利纳入合同会产生何种影响？在风险中性条件下，我们发现：（1）该权利归属对投资和经济效率无实质影响，尽管可能改变合同条款与收入分配；（2）虽然权利分配方式无关紧要，但该权利的引入可能对经济效率产生正向或负向影响。本研究为风险厌恶条件下控制权更广泛的研究提供了基准框架。资源链接: The Irrelevance ofControlRights in Agency Models underRiskNeutrality",

Philip Morris that the U.S. Government had proven its case.  The court found that the tobacco company defendants violated the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) and engaged in a fifty-year conspiracy to defraud the American public and the world.  Specific remedies were ordered. The Verdict Is In: Findings from United States v. Philip Morris is a compilation of select quotes from 1,259 pages of findings in Judge Kessler’s 1,700-page opinion. The final opinion is a masterpiece of legal scholarship: clear, thorough and compelling.  Its only shortcoming is its length.  With so much deceit to chronicle, the opinion is longer than a Russian novel.  Its heft alone is enough to deter most readers. Our goal in preparing this compilation has been to extract highlights of the court’s findings that help tell the story in a direct and easily understandable way.  We have taken great care in quoting verbatim and in chronological order from the court’s opinion, and in providing the original legal citations, footnotes, and court numbered paragraphs.  The publication contains seven sections that correspond with sections in the findings that address the hazards of smoking, addiction, nicotine levels, “light” cigarettes, marketing to youth, secondhand smoke, and the suppression of information.2006年8月17日，经过六年诉讼、九个月庭审、数百份证词和数千件证据呈递，美国地方法院法官格拉迪斯·凯斯勒在美国诉菲利普·莫里斯案中裁定美国政府胜诉。法庭认定烟草公司被告违反《反诈骗腐败组织集团犯罪法》，实施了长达五十年的欺诈美国公众及全球消费者的阴谋，并下达了具体整改措施。《判决落定：美国诉菲利普·莫里斯案裁决精要》是从凯斯勒法官1700页判决书中1259页事实认定部分精选的语录汇编。这份终审判决堪称法学典范：清晰、详尽且令人信服，唯篇幅稍显冗长。为记录如此庞杂的欺诈行为，判决书厚度超越俄国小说，单是体积就足以令多数读者却步。本汇编旨在提炼法庭认定要旨，以直观易懂的方式呈现事件全貌。我们严格遵循判决书原文逐字引用，按时间顺序编排，并保留原始法律引证、脚注及法庭编号段落。全书七大章节对应判决书中关于吸烟危害、成瘾性、尼古丁含量、”淡味”香烟、青少年营销、二手烟及信息压制等核心问题的认定内容。资源链接: The Verdict Is In: Findings from United States v.

Cummins et al (2006) have proposed a cost function specification that measures separately insurer efficiency in handling risk pooling, risk management, and financial intermediation functions. We investigate the insurer characteristics that determine these efficiencies. Our empirical results show that mutuals outperform stock insurers in handling the three functions. Independent agents and high capitalization reduce the cost efficiency of risk pooling. Certain characteristics such as being a group of affiliated insurers, handling a higher volume of business in commercial lines, assuming more reinsurance, or investing a higher proportion of assets in bonds, do significantly increase insurers’ efficiency in risk management and financial intermediation.公司财务理论预测，企业的特征会影响代理成本，从而影响其效率。Cummins等人（2006年）提出了一种成本函数规范，分别衡量保险公司在风险汇聚、风险管理和金融中介职能方面的效率。我们研究了决定这些效率的保险公司特征。实证结果表明，互助保险公司在这三项职能上的表现优于股份制保险公司。独立代理人和高资本化会降低风险汇聚的成本效率。某些特征，如作为附属保险公司集团、在商业保险领域处理更高业务量、承担更多再保险、或将更高比例的资产投资于债券，确实显著提高了保险公司在风险管理和金融中介方面的效率。资源链接: Determinants of Insurers’ Performance inRiskPooling,RiskManagement, and Financial Intermediation Activities",

And with all economies becoming increasingly open against the backdrop of globalization, the role of trade in development is much more prominent. The Heads of State and Government at the 2005 World Summit reaffirmed their commitment to ensuring that trade plays its full part in promoting economic growth, employment and development for all. How can implementation of this commitment be monitored? The Trade and Development Index (TDI) responds to this question with an innovative conceptual and quantitative framework looking systematically at the interactions among different factors that determine trade and human development outcomes. The usefulness of the TDI lies in its integration of three key functions: monitoring the trade and development performance of countries; diagnosing and identifying factors affecting their performance; and providing a policy tool for national and international action to keep trade focused on development and poverty reduction.贸易对发展的贡献在很大程度上取决于贸易运作的背景及其服务的目标。没有国家能在不进行贸易的情况下实现增长。在全球化的背景下，随着所有经济体日益开放，贸易在发展中的作用更加突出。2005年世界首脑会议上的各国元首和政府首脑重申了他们的承诺，即确保贸易在促进经济增长、就业和所有人的发展方面充分发挥作用。如何对这一承诺的执行情况进行监督？贸易和发展指数（TDI）通过一个创新的概念和量化框架来回答这个问题，系统地考察决定贸易和人类发展成果的不同因素之间的相互作用。TDI的实用性在于它整合了三个关键功能：监测各国的贸易和发展表现；诊断和识别影响其表现的因素；为国家和国际行动提供政策工具，使贸易始终聚焦于发展和减贫。资源链接: Developing Countries in InternationalTrade2005:Tradeand Development Index",

        "content": "In modern society, products are often subject to requirements relating to their characteristics and/or the manner in which they are produced. The purpose of these requirements may be the protection of life or health, the protection of the environment, the prevention of deceptive practices or to ensure the quality of products. These requirements may constitute formidable barriers to trade. Moreover, procedures set up to verify whether a product meets certain requirements may obstruct trade. These barriers to trade are referred to as technical barriers to trade. One must distinguish between:   the general category of technical barriers to trade, for which rules have been set out in the TBT Agreement; and    a special category of technical barriers to trade, namely sanitary and phytosanitary measures, for which rules are provided in the SPS Agreement. The rules of the TBT Agreement and the SPS Agreement are of great importance to international trade. They go significantly beyond the GATT obligations not to discriminate among or against imported products or not to impose quantitative restrictions but also impose certain international disciplines on national regulation regarding products, their characteristics and production. This working paper gives an overview of the scope of application as well as the substantive and institutional/procedural provisions of the TBT Agreement and the SPS Agreement.在现代社会中，产品常需符合与其特性及/或生产方式相关的要求。这些要求的目的可能是保护生命健康、保护环境、防止欺诈行为或确保产品质量。此类要求可能构成巨大的贸易壁垒。此外，为验证产品是否符合特定要求而设立的程序也可能阻碍贸易。这类贸易壁垒被称为技术性贸易壁垒。必须区分以下两类：. • 一般性技术贸易壁垒，其规则由《技术性贸易壁垒协定》（TBT协定）规定；. • 特殊技术贸易壁垒，即卫生与植物检疫措施，其规则由《实施卫生与植物检疫措施协定》（SPS协定）规定。. . TBT协定与SPS协定的规则对国际贸易至关重要。它们不仅大幅超越了《关税及贸易总协定》（GATT）关于不歧视进口产品或不实施数量限制的义务，还对各国关于产品特性及生产的法规设定了国际纪律约束。本工作文件概述了TBT协定与SPS协定的适用范围、实质性条款及制度性/程序性规定。资源链接: WTO Rules onTechnicalBarriers toTrade",

GCs, in demanding higher accountability for a company’s IP holdings, require IP counsel to acquire multidisciplinary knowledge in the execution of an offensive risk management strategy that is pertinent to the company’s strategic operating plan. From IP counsels’ perspective, a comprehensive and successful legal risk management program inherently requires particular attention to the proper preparation of opinions and deliberate drafting of underlying IP rights. These responsibilities, however, should be assumed in combination with non-traditional forums of indemnity and cyberlaw that assist IP counsel in identifying the greatest risks inherent in the company’s IP operations. Integration of the IP counsel’s traditional means of risk mitigation across different practice areas grants IP counsel the opportunity for multidisciplinary cooperation as part of an overall legal risk management plan that preserves the maximum value of the IP portfolio.随着股东和监管机构在企业运营的各个层面识别风险，总法律顾问（GCs）愈发认识到与内部知识产权（IP）法律顾问加强合作的必要性。为提升企业对知识产权资产的责任要求，总法律顾问要求IP法律顾问在执行与企业战略运营计划相关的主动风险管理策略时，需具备跨学科知识。从IP法律顾问的角度看，全面且成功的法律风险管理方案必然需要特别注重法律意见书的恰当准备和基础知识产权的审慎撰写。然而，这些职责应与非传统的赔偿机制及网络法律领域相结合，以帮助IP法律顾问识别企业IP运营中固有的重大风险。通过将IP法律顾问传统的风险缓释手段整合至不同业务领域，使其有机会在整体法律风险管理计划框架下开展跨学科协作，从而最大限度维护知识产权组合的价值。资源链接: How to Stump a Corporate Lawyer: Means of Effective LegalRiskManagementfor IP Counsel",

Empirical evidence is presented how, in the framework of the CreditRisk+ model with integrated correlations, this method leads to an increased economic capital estimate. Thus, the limits of detecting the portfolio’s diversification potential are adequately reflected.信用组合的风险主要取决于潜在协变量之间的相关性，例如不同经济部门的违约概率（PD）。通常，相关性必须从相对较短的时间序列中估计，而由此产生的估计误差会阻碍信号的检测。我们提出了一种通用的参数估计方法，该方法以可控方式避免低估相关性风险。实证证据表明，在具有集成相关性的CreditRisk+模型框架下，该方法会导致经济资本估计值增加。因此，投资组合分散化潜力的检测局限得到了充分反映。资源链接: Modelling Correlations in Credit PortfolioRisk",

        "content": "At a time when the high-tech industry has increasingly demanded harmonized standards, China has signaled its intention to follow a different direction.  China’s recent actions seeking to set its own unique standards instead of adopting international standards shifts focus to the impact on international trade and the corresponding legal framework defining responsibilities for State members of the World Trade Organization.  While trade barriers of the past - high tariffs and quotas imposed on imports - have been greatly reduced, less obvious impediments normally referred to as non-tariff barriers (NTBs) have in many cases replaced them.  One area ripe for the incursion of NTBs concerns technology standards.  The WTO’s Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade recognizes the important contribution that international standards can make by improving efficiency of production and facilitating the conduct of international trade, but also cautions that standards should not be used to create NTBs.  China’s WAPI standard provides a test-case for ICT standards and their relationship to the international trade regime. It serves to illustrate standards’ dual nature as trade facilitators and indispensable elements of the ICT industry, on the one hand, and as potential measures of protectionism when applied inappropriately, on the other hand.  As China’s economic power grows and it becomes more adept at playing the standards game, it may find new means for pressing its own concerns in relation to international standards and trade-related issues.在高科技产业日益要求统一标准之际，中国却表现出要走不同方向的意图。中国近期寻求制定自身独特标准而非采用国际标准的举动，将关注焦点转向了对国际贸易的影响，以及界定世界贸易组织成员国责任的相应法律框架。虽然过去的贸易壁垒——对进口商品征收高额关税和配额——已大幅减少，但在许多情况下，它们已被不太明显的障碍所取代，这些障碍通常被称为非关税壁垒（NTBs）。技术标准领域正是非关税壁垒容易侵入的一个领域。世贸组织的《技术性贸易壁垒协定》承认国际标准通过提高生产效率和促进国际贸易开展所能做出的重要贡献，但也警告不应将标准用于制造非关税壁垒。中国的WAPI标准为信息通信技术标准及其与国际贸易体系的关系提供了一个测试案例。它一方面说明了标准作为贸易促进者和信息通信技术产业不可或缺要素的双重性质，另一方面也说明了标准若应用不当可能成为保护主义手段。随着中国经济实力的增长以及更擅长参与标准制定游戏，它可能会找到新的手段来推动自身在国际标准和贸易相关问题上的诉求。资源链接: Technology Standards - NewTechnicalBarriers toTrade?",

        "content": "In the use of peer group data to assess individual, typical or best practice performance, the effective detection of outliers is critical for achieving useful results, particularly for two-stage analyses.  In the DEA-related literature, prior work on this issue has focused on the efficient frontier as a basis for detecting outliers. An iterative approach to deal with the potential for one outlier to mask the presence of another has been proposed but not demonstrated.  This paper proposes using both the efficient frontier and the inefficient frontier to identify outliers and thereby improve the accuracy of second stage results in two-stage nonparametric analysis.  The iterative outlier detection approach is implemented in a leave-one-out method using both the efficient frontier and the inefficient frontier and demonstrated in a two-stage semi-parametric bootstrapping analysis of a classic data set.  The results show that the conclusions drawn can be different when outlier identification includes consideration of the inefficient frontier.在使用同群数据评估个体、典型或最佳实践表现时，有效识别异常值对获得有用结果至关重要，尤其是在两阶段分析中。在DEA相关文献中，此前关于此问题的研究主要聚焦于以效率前沿作为异常值检测基础。虽有研究提出迭代方法处理一个异常值掩盖另一个异常值的可能性，但未得到实证验证。本文提出同时利用效率前沿和非效率前沿来识别异常值，从而提高两阶段非参数分析中第二阶段结果的准确性。该迭代式异常值检测方法通过留一法实现，结合效率前沿与非效率前沿，并在经典数据集的两阶段半参数自助法分析中得到验证。结果表明，当异常值识别纳入非效率前沿考量时，所得结论可能发生变化。资源链接: An OutlierDetectionMethodology with Consideration for an Inefficient Frontier",

        "content": "User profiling, which classifies users into different risk classes, is regarded as a cost effective method to ensure adequate security of critical assets and services in many domains in which adversaries have heterogeneous incentives to commit security breaches. The benefit of profiling is that it allows firms to use an optimally designed and possibly a different detection system for each risk class whereas all users will be sent through the same detection system when profiling is not used. While profiling can be a useful tool in security, we show that the use of profiling and multiple detection systems increases high-risk users’ incentives to fake their identity, and that this incentive increases when the profiling accuracy increases. The direct effect of an increase in the profiling accuracy is the increase in the likelihood that a high-risk user faking his identity will be classified as a low-risk user. The indirect effect is that the higher disparity in optimal detection rates for the high- and low-risk users resulting from a higher profiling accuracy provides more incentive for high-risk users to fake.  If faking is sufficiently easy or the profiling accuracy is sufficiently poor, then the use of profiling results in a more expensive and less secure security system. We show that, in order to reap the maximum benefit out of profiling, an improvement in the accuracy of profiling technology should be accompanied by a minimum level of increase in the users’ cost to fake or cheat the profiling system. If faking is not an issue, then it is optimal for a firm to design detection systems that operate at their efficient detection rates; the efficient detection rate for a high-risk (low-risk) user increases (decreases) when the profiling accuracy increases. However, we show that, when faking is possible, if the profiling accuracy is higher than a threshold value, then it is optimal to make the detection systems more similar by degrading the detection rate of the detection system for a high-risk user and enhancing the detection rate of the detection system for a low-risk user.用户画像技术通过将用户划分为不同风险等级，被视为保障关键资产与服务安全的成本效益型方法，尤其适用于攻击动机存在显著差异的多个领域。该技术的优势在于：企业可为每个风险等级定制最优检测系统，而无画像技术时所有用户需通过同一套检测机制。尽管画像技术能提升安防效能，但我们的研究表明，采用多套检测系统会刺激高风险用户伪造身份，且这种动机随着画像精度的提升而增强。精度提高的直接效应是：高风险用户伪装成低风险类别的成功率上升；间接效应则是：高低风险用户间最优检测率的差距扩大，进一步激励高风险用户实施身份欺诈。若伪造成本过低或画像精度过差，采用画像技术反而会导致安防系统成本攀升且防护效能下降。研究证明，要最大化画像技术收益，必须在提升画像精度的同时，同步提高用户伪造身份的最低成本门槛。当不存在身份伪造风险时，企业最优策略是让高低风险用户的检测系统分别运行在效率最优的检测率——画像精度提升会相应提高（降低）对高风险（低风险）用户的检测强度。但存在伪造行为时，若画像精度超过临界值，则需通过降低高风险用户检测强度、提升低风险用户检测强度，使两套系统检测率趋同才符合最优策略。资源链接: Economics of User Segmentation, Profiling, andDetectionin Security",

        "content": "There has been increasing support in the empirical literature that both the probability of default (PD) and the loss given default (LGD) are correlated and driven by macroeconomic variables. Paradoxically, there has been very little effort from the theoretical literature to develop credit risk models that would include this possibility. The goals of this paper are: first, to develop the theoretical reduced-form framework needed to handle stochastic correlation of recovery and intensity, proposing a new class of models; second, to understand under what conditions would our class of models reflect empirically observed features and, finally, to use concrete model from our class to study the impact of this correlation in credit risk term structures.  We show that, in our class of models, it is possible to model directly empirically observed features. For instance, we can define default intensity and losses given default to be higher during economic depression periods - the well-know credit risk business cycle effect. Using the concrete model we show that in reduced-form models different assumptions - concerning default intensities, distribution of losses given default, and specifically their correlation - have a significant impact on the shape of credit spread term structures, and consequently on pricing of credit products as well as credit risk assessment in general. Finally, we propose a way to calibrate this class of models to market data, and illustrate the technique using our concrete example using US market data on corporate yields.实证文献中越来越多的证据表明，违约概率（PD）与违约损失率（LGD）存在相关性，且两者均受宏观经济变量驱动。然而矛盾的是，理论文献却鲜少尝试构建包含这种可能性的信用风险模型。本文目标有三：首先，建立处理回收率与违约强度随机相关性的理论简化形式框架，提出新模型类别；其次，探究该模型类在何种条件下能反映实证观察到的特征；最后，通过具体模型研究这种相关性对信用风险期限结构的影响。我们证明，该模型类可直接刻画实证观察到的特征。例如，能定义经济萧条时期更高的违约强度与违约损失率——即众所周知的信用风险经济周期效应。通过具体模型展示：在简化形式模型中，关于违约强度、违约损失率分布及其相关性的不同假设，会显著影响信用利差期限结构的形态，进而影响信用产品定价及整体信用风险评估。最后，我们提出基于市场数据校准此类模型的方法，并运用美国公司债券收益率市场数据进行实例演示。资源链接: Correlation Between Intensity and Recovery in CreditRiskModels",

Judging from the draft Ministerial Text submitted by Chairman of the General Council (GC) and the Director-General (DG) to the WTO members in anticipation of the HK Ministerial Meeting, the concern about the plight of the LDCs seems to have increased considerably. There is a need for initiating measures to improve the trade related technical assistance (TRTA) and trade related capacity building (TRCB). While calling for improved aid is laudable and urgently needed, at the same time member countries should take a step back and reflect on what has been done so far in the name of TRTA in order to reach an agreement on TRTA at the HK Ministerial Meeting which will have sufficient chances of actually leading to sustained improvement of living conditions in the LDCs.在世界贸易组织（WTO）香港部长级会议召开前夕，发展中国家尤其是最不发达国家（LDCs）的需求日益受到关注，这些国家大多深陷长期贫困与债务困境。从总理事会（GC）主席和总干事（DG）为筹备香港部长级会议向WTO成员提交的《部长宣言草案》来看，对最不发达国家困境的关注度已显著提升。当前亟需启动措施以改进贸易相关技术援助（TRTA）和贸易相关能力建设（TRCB）。尽管呼吁增加援助值得赞许且迫在眉睫，但各成员国也应回溯反思过往以TRTA名义开展的各项行动，以便在香港部长级会议上达成真正有望持续改善最不发达国家生活条件的TRTA协议。资源链接: TechnicalAssistance and Capacity Building for Ldcs: Time to Reconsider",

        "content": "Credit risk is the major challenge for risk managers and market regulators. Banks, regulators and central banks do not agree on how to measure credit risk and, more particularly, on how to compute the optimal capital that is necessary for protecting the different partners that share this risk. Asking banks to keep too much capital in reserve to cover credit risk can be a source of market distortion in risk management behavior. All these issues arise in part because credit risk is not well understood. So the contribution of Duffie and Singleton will be welcomed by the academics, regulators, and practitioners who consult it. The book has thirteen chapters, three appendices (two on affine processes), a comprehensive list of references, and an index (authors and subjects). It covers all subjects related to credit risk. The main focus is modeling credit risk: measuring portfolio credit risk and pricing different securities exposed to credit risk. The focus on credit risk management is less important. The book covers with great clarity the relevant topics of credit risk. It reflects the strong academic competence of the authors. This is certainly the best reference on credit risk available on the market. I recommend the book to academics and professionals, and also for the teaching of credit risk at Masters and PhD levels in finance and economics.信用风险是风险经理和市场监管者面临的主要挑战。银行、监管机构和中央银行在如何衡量信用风险，尤其是如何计算保护风险分担各方所需的最优资本方面存在分歧。要求银行留存过多资本以覆盖信用风险，可能导致风险管理行为的市场扭曲。这些问题的出现部分源于人们对信用风险的理解尚不充分。因此，达菲和辛格尔顿的著作将受到学术界、监管机构和从业者的欢迎。全书共十三章，含三个附录（其中两个涉及仿射过程）、详尽的参考文献列表及作者与主题索引，涵盖了信用风险相关所有议题。核心内容聚焦信用风险建模：包括投资组合信用风险度量及信用风险相关证券定价。信用风险管理并非本书重点。该书以极高清晰度阐述了信用风险关键课题，彰显了作者深厚的学术造诣。这无疑是当前市场上最权威的信用风险参考著作。我向学术界与专业人士强烈推荐此书，同时也建议将其用于金融经济领域硕士及博士阶段的信用风险教学。资源链接: Book Review of CreditRisk: Pricing, Measurement, andManagement",

This paper explores this change, using sociological perspectives on risk and its conceptualisation to frame the debate about internal control and risk management within the UK corporate governance arena - the most recent manifestation of an ongoing competition for the control of economic and social resources. The paper demonstrates that developments in corporate governance reporting requirements offer opportunities for the appropriation of risk and its management by groups wishing to advance their own interests.

This question is a timely one, since many firms have a special committee devoted to risk management - banks and insurance companies in particular. In the wake of the Enron affair, various proposals have been formulated regarding the composition of the different committees set up by boards of directors. In the financial literature, it is now a widely accepted fact that risk management issues can give rise to conflicts of interest between heads of firms and shareholders, notably when executives are remunerated in stock options. In our opinion, the board’s risk management committee must be composed of competent and independent directors who hold no options to purchase the firm’s shares.我们探讨风险管理政策目标与公司价值最大化目标之间可能存在的冲突问题。这一问题具有现实意义，因为许多企业（尤其是银行和保险公司）都设立了专门的风险管理委员会。安然事件后，针对董事会下设各委员会的组成已提出了多种改革方案。金融学界现已普遍认同：当高管薪酬采用股票期权形式时，风险管理问题可能导致企业负责人与股东之间的利益冲突。我们认为，董事会风险管理委员会必须由不持有公司股票期权的、具备专业能力且保持独立性的董事组成。资源链接: RiskManagementand Corporate Governance",

        "content": "Weather derivatives are financial contracts that allow entities to hedge themselves against the adverse impacts of fluctuations in the weather. The pricing of such contracts is based on a combination of actuarial and arbitrage methods. Risk management of portfolios of weather derivatives centres on the estimation of two distributions: the expiry distribution and the short term risk distribution. These distributions can be used to calculate the expiry VaR and the VaR, respectively. The expiry distribution can be estimated relatively easily using the actuarial methods used to price contracts and manage portfolios. The short term risk distribution, however, is much more difficult to estimate since it depends on market dynamics and the statistics of changes in probabilistic meteorological forecasts. Nevertheless, we show that, under certain reasonable assumptions, the short term risk distribution for a large class of standard contracts takes a particularly simple form. It depends on a single volatility that can be derived without having to perform any statistical analysis of past forecasts. In addition we show that the framework we develop for calculating the short term risk distribution leads to a simple method for the actuarial valuation of options during the contract period.天气衍生品是一种金融合约，允许实体对冲天气波动带来的不利影响。此类合约的定价基于精算与套利方法的结合。天气衍生品组合的风险管理核心在于对两种分布的估算：到期分布与短期风险分布。这两种分布可分别用于计算到期风险价值（VaR）和风险价值（VaR）。利用定价合约和管理组合的精算方法，到期分布相对容易估算。然而短期风险分布的估算则困难得多，因为它取决于市场动态和概率气象预报变化的统计特性。尽管如此，我们证明在特定合理假设下，大量标准合约的短期风险分布具有特别简单的形式——其仅取决于单一波动率参数，且无需对历史预测数据进行统计分析即可推导得出。此外，我们提出的短期风险分布计算框架还能衍生出合约期间期权精算估值的简易方法。资源链接: Weather Derivative Pricing andRiskManagement: Volatility and Value atRisk",

In contrast to previous research on assessing the accuracy of risk systems or VaR, which has focused on backtesting a large sample of  historical observations, we provide tools for real-time assessment, using a time window that varies adaptively with the data.  The objective is to quickly signal if the estimation process is systematically biased, subject to a specified rate of false detections.  For example, if the volatility is systematically underestimated by 25 percent our procedure detects this in an average of 25 observations.  Previous techniques have often backtested thousands of observations. We also discuss the trade-off between increasing detection power at the risk of detecting meaningless errors and suggest a parameter to specify the balance desired for a specific application.企业财务主管面临的一个重要问题是，当前的风险管理系统（如风险价值VaR）是否能够产生准确结果。与以往通过回溯测试大量历史数据样本来评估风险系统或VaR准确性的研究不同，我们提供了实时评估工具，采用随数据自适应变化的时间窗口。该方法旨在快速识别估值过程是否存在系统性偏差，同时将误判率控制在指定范围内。例如，当波动率被系统性低估25%时，我们的程序平均仅需25次观测即可检测出偏差，而传统技术往往需要回溯数千次观测数据。我们还探讨了提高检测灵敏度与误检无关误差之间的权衡关系，并提出了一个参数来根据具体应用需求指定平衡点。资源链接: StructuredRiskAssessment and Value-at-Risk",

We describe the specific needs of an asset management company, in terms of proper financial modelling, time and resources constraints, given that an investment company: - manages “third party funds” (eventual losses are not its liabilities); - has a relatively long investment horizon, if compared to other market participants; - often monitors relative risk, rather than absolute risk. As models for estimating portfolio risk on medium-long horizons are crucial, and the related theoretical problems are absolutely not trivial, we briefly describe the model we use. It is based on bootstrapping, that allows us to calculate several risk measures for a large number of portfolios. It allows us to simulate medium-term to long-term financial scenarios, without imposing any particular probability function, taking into account heteroscedasticity, serial correlation, and any existing market views. We shortly describe the implementation, with  some details on the database and the calculation engine (both available on the market). This kind of system is more straightforward and cheaper to implement than traditional, bank-oriented risk systems: it  took less than one year to implement the whole tool, with limited costs (basically some cheap licences and the work of two quants). We hope that our experience could be of help to other asset management companies.本文探讨了银行与资产管理公司在风险管理含义上的差异，并阐述了为一家意大利中型公司构建风险管理体系时所找到的解决方案。我们描述了资产管理公司在适当金融建模、时间和资源限制方面的特定需求，考虑到投资公司具有以下特点：管理”第三方资金”（潜在损失不构成其负债）；相较于其他市场参与者拥有相对较长的投资期限；通常监测相对风险而非绝对风险。鉴于中长期投资组合风险评估模型至关重要且相关理论问题绝非简单，我们简要介绍了所采用的基于自助法的模型。该模型能计算大量投资组合的多项风险指标，模拟中长期金融场景，无需设定特定概率函数，同时考虑异方差性、序列相关性及现有市场观点。我们简述了系统实施过程，包括数据库与计算引擎（均为市售产品）的若干细节。此类系统比传统银行导向的风险系统更易实施且成本更低：整套工具开发耗时不足一年，成本有限（主要为廉价许可证和两名量化分析师的投入）。希望我们的经验能为其他资产管理公司提供参考。资源链接: RiskManagementin an AssetManagementCompany: A Practical Case",

        "content": "From the risk management’s perspective, one of the main differences between asset management companies and banks concerns the investment horizon: typically, asset managers have longer investment horizons. We compare different ways to deal with medium/long horizons, when the aim is to calculate absolute or relative VaR using a historical simulation approach and its variations, like bootstrapping procedures. We use several indices to test the accuracy of the different methods analysed. We find these methodologies: - can provide satisfactory assessments of tactical risk; - can inform portfolio managers of changes in market risk; - are also promising for strategic risk analysis.从风险管理的角度来看，资产管理公司与银行之间的主要差异之一涉及投资期限：通常资产管理公司拥有更长的投资期限。我们比较了处理中长期期限的不同方法，旨在使用历史模拟法及其变体（如自助法程序）计算绝对或相对风险价值。我们采用多种指数来测试所分析不同方法的准确性。研究发现这些方法：- 能对战术风险提供令人满意的评估；- 可向投资组合经理提示市场风险的变化；- 对于战略风险分析也颇具前景。资源链接: RiskAnalysis for Asset Managers: Historical Simulation, the Bootstrap Approach and Value atRiskCalculation",

        "content": "The use of derivatives in corporate risk management has grown rapidly in recent years. In this paper, the authors explore the factors that influence the use of financial derivatives in the U.S. insurance industry. Their objective is to investigate the motivations for corporate risk management The authors use regulatory data on individual holdings and transactions in derivative markets. According to modern finance theory, shares of widely held corporations are held by diversified investors who operate in frictionless and complete markets and eliminate non-systematic risk through their portfolio choices. But this theory has been challenged by new hypotheses that take into account market imperfections, information asymmetries and incentive conflicts as motivations for corporate managers to change the risk/return profile of their firm. The authors develop a set of hypotheses regarding the hedging behavior of insurers and perform tests on a sample of life and property-liability insurers to test them. The sample consists of all U.S. life and property-liability insurers reporting to the NAIC. The authors investigate the decision to conduct derivatives transactions and the volume of transactions undertaken. There are two primary theories about the motivations for corporate risk management - maximization of shareholder value and maximization of managerial utility. The authors discuss these theories, the hypotheses they develop from them , and specify variables to test their hypotheses. They posit the following rationales for why corporations may choose to engage in risk management and also specify variables that help them study the use of these rationales by insurance firms: to avoid the costs of financial distress; to hedge part of their investment default/volatility/liquidity risks; to avoid shocks to equity that result in high leverage ratios; to minimize taxes and enhance firm value by reducing the volatility of earnings; to maximize managerial utility. The authors argue that the use of derivatives for speculative purposes in the insurance industry is not common. The authors analyze the decision by insurers to enter the market and their volume of transactions. They use probit analysis to study the participation decision and Tobit analysis along with Cragg’s generalization of the Tobit analysis to study volume. The results provide support for the authors’ hypothesis that insurers hedge to maximize shareholder value. The analysis provides only weak support for the managerial utility hypothesis. Insurers are motivated to use financial derivatives to reduce the expected costs of financial distress. There is also evidence that insurers use derivatives to hedge asset volatility and exchange rate risks. There is also evidence that there are significant economies of scale in running derivatives operations - only large firms and/or those with higher than average risk exposure find it worthwhile to pay the fixed cost of setting up a derivatives operation. Overall, insurers with higher than average asset risk exposures use derivative securities.近年来，衍生品在企业风险管理中的运用迅速增长。本文作者探讨了影响美国保险业使用金融衍生品的因素，旨在研究企业风险管理的动机。作者利用监管机构提供的衍生品市场个体持仓与交易数据展开分析。现代金融理论认为，股权分散型企业的股票由多元化投资者持有，这些投资者在无摩擦的完全市场中通过投资组合选择消除非系统性风险。但该理论正受到新假说的挑战——这些假说将市场缺陷、信息不对称和激励冲突视为企业管理者调整公司风险/收益特征的动因。作者针对保险公司的对冲行为提出一系列假设，并通过对寿险与财产责任险公司的样本测试进行验证。研究样本涵盖所有向美国保险监督官协会（NAIC）提交报告的美国寿险及财产责任险公司。作者重点考察了企业开展衍生品交易的决策过程及交易规模。关于企业风险管理动机存在两大主流理论：股东价值最大化理论和管理者效用最大化理论。作者讨论了这些理论及其衍生的假设，并设定变量进行检验。他们提出以下企业可能选择风险管理的理由，同时设定相应变量以研究保险公司对这些理由的运用：规避财务困境成本；对冲部分投资违约/波动性/流动性风险；避免导致高杠杆率的权益冲击；通过降低盈利波动实现节税并提升企业价值；实现管理者效用最大化。作者指出保险业鲜少将衍生品用于投机目的。通过分析保险公司进入衍生品市场的决策与交易规模，作者采用概率单位模型（Probit）研究参与决策，并运用托宾模型（Tobit）及Cragg对托宾模型的推广来研究交易规模。结果支持作者关于”保险公司为股东价值最大化进行对冲”的假设，但对管理者效用假说的支持较弱。研究表明：保险公司运用金融衍生品的主要动机是降低预期财务困境成本；同时存在证据表明其通过衍生品对冲资产波动性与汇率风险；衍生品业务运营具有显著规模效应——仅大型公司和/或风险敞口高于平均水平的企业认为值得支付建立衍生品业务的固定成本。总体而言，资产风险敞口高于平均水平的保险公司更倾向于使用衍生证券。资源链接: Derivatives and CorporateRiskManagement: Participation and Volume Decisions in the Insurance Industry",
