risk management,Mathematical Explanation and Derivation of the Aggregate Cost ofRiskin the Banking Industry,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5172415,"Dr Aakash Ramchand Dil PhD (Maths) DBA (Risk Management), CQF","The banking industry operates within a complex environment where financial risks are inherent and multifaceted, necessitating a rigorous understanding of the aggregate cost of risk. This concept encapsulates various risks, including credit, market, and operational risks, which are crucial for effective financial management and regulatory compliance. The mathematical explanation and derivation of the aggregate cost of risk serve not only to clarify the relationships between these risks but also to enhance transparency and predictability in risk assessment. In recent years, the proliferation of sophisticated models, particularly those grounded in Artificial Intelligence, has further complicated this landscape; many of these models remain black-boxes in their decision-making processes, hampering trust and interpretability ((Hassija V et al., 2023)). As the need for explainable AI (XAI) methodologies escalates, understanding the mathematical principles underlying the aggregate cost of risk becomes imperative for both theoretical inquiry and practical application ((Ali S et al., 2023)).",银行业运营于一个复杂的环境中，金融风险具有内在性与多面性，因此必须严格理解风险总成本。这一概念涵盖了信用风险、市场风险和操作风险等多种风险，对于有效的财务管理和监管合规至关重要。风险总成本的数学解释与推导不仅能阐明这些风险之间的关系，还能提升风险评估的透明度和可预测性。近年来，复杂模型（尤其是基于人工智能的模型）的激增进一步加剧了这一领域的复杂性；其中许多模型在决策过程中仍处于黑箱状态，削弱了信任度与可解释性（Hassija V等，2023）。随着对可解释人工智能（XAI）方法的需求日益增长，理解风险总成本背后的数学原理已成为理论探索与实际应用的必然要求（Ali S等，2023）。,"cost of risk, risk management, enterprise risk management",2025-03-10
risk management,Incorporating Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics in Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis for EnhancedRiskManagementin Financial Institutions,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5193094,"Dr Aakash Ramchand Dil PhD (Maths) DBA (Risk Management), CQF","Machine learning and big data analytics are now part of stress testing and scenario analysis, sparking a noticeable shift in how banks handle risk. As financial markets get more tangled and risks loom larger, older methods just don’t cut it these days—generally speaking, they miss the mark on today's challenges. This essay looks into how newer, cleverer analytical techniques can ramp up both the accuracy and impact of risk assessments, helping institutions spot and dodge systemic problems more effectively. It also fits well with the growing push for banks to reinvent their risk management systems in light of changing regulations and environmental pressures (HUSEYNOV et al., 2024). Recent studies on hybrid risk cultures even point out that management teams view risk very differently, which shows why a one-size-fits-all approach simply won’t do (Ingram et al., 2014). All in all, this opening overview gets us ready to dive deeper into how machine learning and big data join forces to reshape financial risk management.",机器学习与大数据分析现已融入压力测试和情景分析领域，显著改变了银行处理风险的方式。随着金融市场日益复杂、风险不断加剧，传统方法已难以应对当前挑战——总体而言，这些方法无法满足当下需求。本文探讨了如何通过更智能的新型分析技术提升风险评估的准确性与影响力，助力机构更有效地识别和规避系统性风险。这也契合了监管要求与环境压力下银行重塑风险管理体系的迫切需求（HUSEYNOV等，2024）。关于混合风险文化的最新研究甚至指出，管理团队对风险的认知存在显著差异，这证明一刀切的方法根本行不通（Ingram等，2014）。总之，本概述为后续深入探究机器学习与大数据如何协同重塑金融风险管理奠定了基础。,"machine learning, dig data analytics, stress testing, reverse stress testing, scenario analysis, risk management, enterprise risk management, credit risk, market risk, VaR, Value at risk, quantitative analysis",2025-03-25

The focal point of these concerns is credit concentration risk, which highlights the potential for significant losses when a borrower has excessive credit connections. In regions like China, banks frequently encounter difficulties due to unreliable data sources, creating challenges for traditional risk assessment models(Jiang C et al., 2024). Conventional techniques often struggle to navigate such uncertain conditions, leading to a growing interest in innovative solutions such as rough set theory, a method that can provide insights even in situations of incomplete data. With the continuously evolving financial landscape, there is a critical need for adaptable quantitative approaches to effectively manage credit concentration risk. This research urges a reevaluation of risk management practices to address the complexities of today's financial environment.",近期，银行正面临日益加剧的信用风险，尤其在金融市场显现不稳定迹象之际。这些担忧的核心在于信用集中风险——当借款人存在过度信贷关联时，可能引发重大损失。在中国等地区，银行常因数据来源不可靠而陷入困境，这给传统风险评估模型带来了挑战（Jiang C等，2024）。传统方法往往难以应对此类不确定状况，使得粗糙集理论等创新解决方案备受关注，该方法即便在不完整数据条件下仍能提供有效洞见。随着金融环境持续演变，亟需采用适应性强的量化手段来有效管控信用集中风险。本研究呼吁重新审视风险管理实践，以应对当今金融环境的复杂性。,"credit risk, concentration risk, credit concentration risk, European central bank, BASEL II, BASEL III, ICAAP, Pillar 2 ICAAP, PRA approach, Spanish approach, risk management, enterprise risk management, bayesian statistics, financial mathematics, data limitations, UAE banking industry",2025-03-25

These events exposed significant vulnerabilities in how liquidity stress is modeled, especially under rapid withdrawal scenarios amplified by digital banking and social media dynamics. This paper analyzes the sequence of events leading to these failures, evaluates the adequacy of current liquidity risk metrics, particularly the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) that highlights their limitations in capturing the speed and scale of stress outflows. Through a comparative case study and regulatory review, the research argues for recalibrating existing liquidity frameworks to incorporate behavioral triggers, nonlinear outflow patterns, and the systemic impact of depositor concentration. The findings advocate for a more dynamic and forward-looking approach to liquidity risk, combining traditional metrics with real-time analytics and digital risk indicators to enhance early warning capabilities and systemic resilience.",硅谷银行（SVB）的倒闭与2023-2024年间瑞士信贷被强制收购事件，再度引发全球对现代银行业流动性风险管理韧性的担忧。这些危机暴露出流动性压力建模存在重大缺陷——尤其在数字银行与社交媒体效应放大的快速挤兑情景下。本文通过剖析危机演变链条，评估现行流动性风险指标（着重分析流动性覆盖率LCR与净稳定资金比率NSFR）的适用性，揭示其难以捕捉资金外流速度与规模极限的弊端。基于案例比较与监管审视，研究主张重构现有流动性框架，纳入行为触发机制、非线性外流模式及存款集中度的系统性影响。结论指出应融合传统指标与实时分析、数字风险信号，构建更具动态性与前瞻性的流动性风险管理体系，以强化预警能力与系统抗压韧性。,"Liquidity risk, Bank failures, Silicon Valley Bank, Credit Suisse, Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), Stress testing, Depositor behavior, Digital banking risk, Financial stability, Contagion risk, Regulatory reform",2025-05-19
risk management,Actuarial Modeling for Projected Default Rates and Credit Losses in the Financial Sector: An Innovative Approach to Backtesting and Stress Testing,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5181473,"Dr Aakash Ramchand Dil PhD (Maths) DBA (Risk Management), CQF","The increasing complexity of financial instruments and the dynamic nature of market conditions underscore the necessity for robust actuarial modeling techniques aimed at predicting default rates and credit losses. In particular, the application of innovative backtesting and stress testing methodologies plays a crucial role in evaluating model effectiveness and ensuring regulatory compliance. Standard approaches frequently overlook the intricate relationships between various risk factors, which can lead to significant underestimations of potential losses. For instance, the reliance on traditional Value-at-Risk (VaR) models is often insufficient; enhanced methodologies, such as those discussed in (Lima LR et al.), propose more powerful backtesting frameworks capable of assessing competing models performance directly. Furthermore, the asset value-based models, as highlighted in (Engel et al., 2008), emphasize the importance of market dynamics in credit portfolio risk valuation, revealing that updated capital requirements may inadequately safeguard against extreme loss events. This paper aims to explore these innovative approaches further, establishing a narrative on their practical implications in financial risk management.",金融工具的日益复杂和市场环境的动态变化凸显了采用稳健精算建模技术预测违约率和信用损失的必要性。尤其值得注意的是，创新性回测与压力测试方法的应用对评估模型有效性、确保监管合规具有关键作用。传统方法往往忽视各类风险因素间的复杂关联，这可能导致对潜在损失的严重低估。例如，单纯依赖传统风险价值（VaR）模型通常存在不足；如（Lima LR等人）所述，增强型方法论提出了能直接评估竞争模型表现的更强效回测框架。此外，（Engel等人，2008年）强调的基于资产价值模型揭示了市场动态对信用组合风险评估的重要性，研究表明更新后的资本要求可能不足以防范极端损失事件。本文旨在深入探讨这些创新方法，系统阐述其在金融风险管理中的实践意义。,"actuarial modeling, risk management, credit risk modeling, default rates, probability of default, stress testing, reverse stress testing, benchmarking",2025-03-25

The perception of risk depends on the observer’s cognitive biases and world view which nuance risk related decisions. How an observer decides also depends on the metric used to quantify risk. While there is extensive literature on how people perceive risk, and on how to price risk in relation to the market, there is little on how to price risk according to how risks interact within the firm.

To our knowledge, the term “strategic risk management” first appeared in the management literature in 1985 and 1986 (Jammine, 1985; Figenbaum & Thomas, 1986) and in the academic finance literature in 1990 (Rawls  and Smithson, 1990), although early usage of the term did not clearly relate to later conceptions.  The phrase has been in use even longer than ERM (Bromiley, McShane, Nair, and Rustambekov, 2014).  Even with this longevity, the meaning of the term remains unclear, with confusion increasing with the advent of ERM.  For example, does SRM mean the management of a specific category of risks known as “strategic risks” (AICPCU, 2013) or does SRM mean strategic actions/responses taken to mitigate major uncertainties facing the enterprise? Can any type of risk potentially become a strategic risk, or are only certain types of risk strategic?

ERM should theoretically reduce the volatility of cash flows, agency risk and information risk – ultimately reducing a firm’s default risk. We empirically investigate the relationship between the degree of ERM implementation and default risk in a panel dataset covering 78 of the world’s largest banks. We create a novel measure of the degree of ERM implementation. We find that a higher degree of ERM implementation is negatively related to the credit default swap spread (CDS) of a bank. When a rich set of control variables and fixed effects are included, a one standard deviation increase in the degree of ERM implementation decreases CDS spreads by 21 basis points. The degree of ERM implementation is however not a significant determinant of credit ratings when controls for corporate governance are included.",企业风险管理（ERM）已成为一个更全面、更综合的风险管理框架，强调对风险管理体系的强化治理。理论上，ERM应能降低现金流的波动性、代理风险和信息风险，最终减少企业的违约风险。我们基于涵盖全球78家大型银行的面板数据，实证研究了ERM实施程度与违约风险之间的关系。我们创新性地构建了衡量ERM实施程度的指标，发现较高的ERM实施程度与银行的信用违约互换利差（CDS）呈负相关。在纳入大量控制变量和固定效应后，ERM实施程度每提高一个标准差，CDS利差会下降21个基点。但当加入公司治理控制变量时，ERM实施程度对信用评级的影响并不显著。,"Risk management, Credit risk, Enterprise risk management, Corporate governance, Credit rating",2016-04-14

However, the absence of sufficient historical recovery data poses a significant challenge, especially for institutions operating under the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approach or in markets with low-default portfolios. This paper addresses the critical need for a practical, adaptable framework to estimate recovery rates when empirical data is sparse. The proposed framework combines multiple estimation techniques, sectoral benchmarking, expert judgment, collateral and macroeconomic adjustments, and Bayesian inference to derive credible recovery rate approximations. Building upon theoretical constructs such as the adjusted Mertonian structural model, and informed by recent research (e.g., Hlawatsch, Seidler et al.), this approach ensures that institutions can navigate LGD estimation even under strict data constraints. The methodology is illustrated through a case study on SME lending in frontier markets, demonstrating how institutions can produce conservative, transparent, and regulatorily compliant estimates. The framework aligns with Basel II and III principles, particularly around capital adequacy and model validation, and supports sound risk-adjusted pricing and strategic decision-making.

risk management,Methodologies to Develop Low Default Probability of Default Curve Models for the Portfolios with Zero Default Rates in-line with BASEL Requirements,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5198561,"Dr Aakash Ramchand Dil PhD (Maths) DBA (Risk Management), CQF",">At the heart of this work lies the challenge of building reliable PD curve models for portfolios that, for all intents and purposes, have never defaulted, even while keeping Basel rules in check. Instead of following a neat checklist, I wondered just how effective our usual modeling tricks really are; it turns out they often miss the mark when estimating risk for these one-of-a-kind portfolios. I rummaged through heaps of data, old credit records, broad economic shifts, and even performance details specific to different sectors, to uncover some unexpected insights. Blending number crunching with real-world perspective (yes, mixing hard math with a bit of human judgment) seems to give a noticeably better estimate of default probability for accounts typically seen as almost risk-free. This finding rings especially true in places like healthcare, where many portfolios show barely any defaults but also lack advanced risk-check setups. By carving out a more or less structured way to measure default risk, the study ends up giving healthcare providers practical (if not perfectionist) tools to fine-tune their credit risk decisions. In many cases, this mix of approaches paves the way for better overall regulatory compliance and risk management across the financial world, making systems a bit more resilient against economic ups and downs.All in all, this research not only plugs a big gap in current studies but also lays down a foundation for future work on risk modeling in niche sectors.",这项工作的核心挑战在于，如何为实际上从未违约的投资组合建立可靠的违约概率(PD)曲线模型，同时确保符合巴塞尔协议要求。与遵循刻板的检查清单不同，我深入探究了常规建模方法对这些特殊组合的风险评估效果——结果发现它们往往存在偏差。通过梳理海量数据、历史信用记录、宏观经济波动乃至各行业特有的表现细节，我挖掘出若干反直觉的洞见。将数据运算与现实视角结合（即在严谨数学模型中加入人为判断），能显著提升对那些被视为近乎零风险账户的违约概率预测精度。这一发现在医疗健康等领域尤为突出——该行业组合虽鲜有违约案例，却也缺乏完善的风险监测机制。本研究通过构建一套相对结构化的违约风险评估框架，为医疗机构提供了实用（虽非完美）的信用决策优化工具。这种混合方法在多数情况下能促进金融界整体监管合规与风险管理水平，增强系统应对经济波动的韧性。总体而言，该研究不仅填补了现有学术空白，更为细分领域的风险建模奠定了未来研究基石。,"Low-Default Portfolio (LDP), Probability of Default (PD) Estimation, Basel Accord (Basel II, Basel III, Basel IV), Credit Risk Modeling, Regulatory Capital Requirements, Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) Approach, Bayesian Inference for PD Estimation, Zero-Default Adjustments, Supervisory Slotting Criteria, Small Sample Estimation Techniques, Expert Judgment in PD Calibration, Stress Testing for LDPs, Conservative PD Estimation, Regulatory Expectations for LDPs, Benchmarking PD Models, Pluto-Tasche Approach, Sequential Bayesian Updating, Floor Constraint Adjustment, Generalized CreditRisk+ Framework.",2025-04-08

risk management,A Perspective on the Principles for Sustainable Insurance:RiskManagementand Value,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2375809,Nicos Scordis,Some of the largest global insurers are actively pursuing the recently enacted Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI). While the concept of sustainability is often associated with a governance design that promotes stakeholder value the PSI do not appear to be a call for stakeholder-focused insurers. Rather the PSI appear to be about internalizing tacit claims in the operations of insurers. Conceptual and empirical literature on shareholder value maximization suggests that when an insurer honors its tacit claims the value to shareholders increases. A key insight from practice is that a sincere pursuit of the PSI will expand the scope of corporate risk management.,一些全球大型保险公司正在积极推行最新颁布的《可持续保险原则》。虽然可持续发展理念常与促进利益相关者价值的治理设计相关联，但该原则似乎并非呼吁保险公司以利益相关者为核心。相反，该原则更侧重于将隐性权益要求内化于保险公司的运营中。关于股东价值最大化的理论与实证研究表明，当保险公司履行其隐性权益时，股东价值将随之提升。实践中的关键启示在于：真诚贯彻该原则将拓宽企业风险管理的范畴。,"sustainability, shareholder, stakeholder, tacit claims, risk management, insurance",2014-01-09

The Current Post-Doctoral Research Thesis On Finance, Quant, and Risk Modeling beyond the Global Financial Crisis is based upon synthesizing post-crisis Quantitative Finance, Computer Science, Network & Computer Security Engineering R&D. It proposes pioneering Crypto-era Cyber-Finance-Trust Engineering frameworks advancing upon the first Digital Transformation Social Networks Quant Modeling PhD thesis that pioneered post-WWW Digital Quant-IT-Finance-Controls-Risks, Decentralized Control Models, and, Digital-Social Knowledge-Assets R&D.PrefaceComing from an Engineering background as a Chartered Engineer, I led global Banking & Finance modeling and development projects for largest US and worldwide banks. I also led modeling and implementation projects for the Big-3 IT firm on which hundreds of global Banking & Finance firms relied as a key global financial systems provider. Then, I earned a quantitative PhD with 2xPhD Credits from Top-10 PhD Program and subsequently taught as Associate Professor and Assistant Professor of Quantitative Methods at Syracuse University with research focus on quantitative risk modeling. Just before the Global Financial Crisis, my research was surfacing critical questions about the model risk inherent in Financial Engineering models. For instance, I made reference to it in an interview by a UK based global management research publisher in 2005.Those questions were about the compatibility of deterministic and stochastic models of natural sciences with the increasingly non-deterministic, i.e., uncertain, sociotechnical post-WWW digitally social networked world. Those questions were also about the capacity of deterministic and stochastic Financial Engineering risk models to cope with increasing uncertainty characterizing a rapidly and dynamically changing digital world. Those questions led me to post-doctoral research in Quantitative Finance leading to working for top Wall Street investment banks such as JP Morgan Private Bank in midtown Manhattan. My technical and applied hands-on leadership guiding JP Morgan top executives and MDs focused on advancing their advanced Quantitative Finance risk modeling and analytics. I focused on guiding their financial risk modeling beyond quantitative models that had become targets of criticism given association with large-scale financial failures over the span of the Global Financial Crisis.After concluding those Quantitative Finance projects, I continued to further advance related post-doc research in Computational Finance and Cybersecurity. While conducting research on rapidly increasing Cyber risk in Banking and Finance domains with emergency warnings coming from the White House, US Treasury, Department of Homeland Security, and, Office of Comptroller of Currency, this thesis was born. It was born out of the observation about the specific risk models blamed for the Global Financial Crisis which nearly drove US investment banks to extinction. The same models were now becoming the predominant models of choice by commercial providers for cyber risk and cyber insurance related modeling for estimation of potential cyber risk related financial loss….AbstractQuantitative modeling of cyber risk for cyber insurance modeling is at a nascent stage characterized by sparse empirical research and reliable data. Our current investigation reveals that VaR, short for Value-at-Risk (Jorion, 2006), is the current predominant model of choice for cyber insurance modeling. Model risk related to VaR was a key factor in the Global Financial Crisis given its known limitations in modeling tail risks and systemic risks (Haldane & Nelson, 2012; Malhotra, 2012, 20141). As a result, US Federal Reserve and OCC issued model risk compliance guidance for US financial institutions (US Fed & OCC, 2011). Basel Committee of worldwide central bank supervisors stopped relying on VaR for risk modeling (BCBS, 2013). Given history of model risks associated with VaR, we investigate if current reliance of cyber insurance modeling on VaR entails model risk. We develop qualitative frameworks to benchmark relative levels of tail risks and systemic risks associated with cyber risk vis-à-vis financial risks typically modeled with VaR. Our analysis reveals that cyber risk entails exponentially higher tail risks and systemic risks thus making VaR unfit for reliance as the primary risk model for cyber insurance modeling. We develop specific frameworks of model risk management (Derman, 1996; Morini, 2011) for cyber insurance modeling and demonstrate their empirical application in model risk management. We distinguish between model risks arising from the choice of specific quantitative models from those arising from the choice of quantitative methodologies. We demonstrate how to manage model risks associated with VaR using it with multiple simple and advanced models to cross-check its reliability. We also offer alternative coherent risk measures as better alternatives to VaR and empirically demonstrate their application. To enable further minimization of model risk in cyber insurance modeling we do three more things. First, we analyze the Bayesian quantitative statistical inference methodology as a possible alternative to frequentist classical inference methodology that VaR and advanced models typically rely upon. Second, we analyze the Markov Chain Monte Carlo models and related Gibbs Sampling and Metropolis-Hastings statistical computing algorithms to enable the use of Bayesian methodology. Finally, given increasing uncertainty in cyber risk modeling and management, we develop a framework for enabling Knightian uncertainty management (Knight, 1921) relating it to model risk management.ContributionsTo avert the impending national Cyber risk and Cyber-insurance disaster based upon large-scale commercial reliance upon quantitative models with inherent model risks, tail risks, and systemic risks in current form, this dissertation makes the following key contributions.▪ First, we develop the first known Cyber-Finance-Trust framework for Cyber insurance modeling to analyze how finance risk entangled with Cyber risk further exacerbates the systemic, interdependent, and correlated character of Cyber risks.▪ Second, we develop the first known model risk management framework for Cyber insurance modeling as model risk management has received sparse attention in Cyber risk assessment and Cyber insurance modeling.▪ Third, our review of quantitative models in Cyber risk and Cyber insurance modeling develops the first known analysis establishing significant and extreme model risks, tail risks, and, systemic risks related to predominant models in use.▪ Fourth, we develop an empirical study of VaR and Bayesian statistical inference methodologies with specific guidance for containing model risks by applying multiple simple and advanced models for cross-checking the reliability of VaR.▪ Fifth, we develop an analysis of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo Models, Gibbs Sampling and Metropolis-Hastings statistical computing algorithms for enabling Bayesian statistical inference methodologies to minimize model risk in Cyber risk and Cyber insurance risk modeling for the specific context of cybersecurity.▪ Sixth, we develop the first known portfolio theory based framework for Cyber insurance modeling with guidance to minimize model risks, tail risks, and systemic risks inherent in models in commercial Cyber insurance modeling.▪ Finally, given increasing role of uncertainty in cyber (and financial) risk modeling and management, we develop a framework for enabling Knightian uncertainty management relating it to model risk management.Understanding of the developed frameworks and technical models listed above should minimize model risk in the recommended applications based on above contributions.Updated, revised, summary version of the thesis invited for submission by NAIC as:National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Expert Paper: The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is the U.S. standard-setting and regulatory support organization created and governed by the chief insurance regulators from the 50 states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories.

risk management,RiskManagementin an AssetManagementCompany: A Practical Case,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=252294,Dario Brandolini,"The article concerns the differences between the meaning of risk management in a bank and in an asset management company, and then it illustrates the solution found to the challenge of building up a risk management system in an Italian medium size company. We describe the specific needs of an asset management company, in terms of proper financial modelling, time and resources constraints, given that an investment company: - manages ""third party funds"" (eventual losses are not its liabilities); - has a relatively long investment horizon, if compared to other market participants; - often monitors relative risk, rather than absolute risk. As models for estimating portfolio risk on medium-long horizons are crucial, and the related theoretical problems are absolutely not trivial, we briefly describe the model we use. It is based on bootstrapping, that allows us to calculate several risk measures for a large number of portfolios. It allows us to simulate medium-term to long-term financial scenarios, without imposing any particular probability function, taking into account heteroscedasticity, serial correlation, and any existing market views. We shortly describe the implementation, with  some details on the database and the calculation engine (both available on the market). This kind of system is more straightforward and cheaper to implement than traditional, bank-oriented risk systems: it  took less than one year to implement the whole tool, with limited costs (basically some cheap licences and the work of two quants). We hope that our experience could be of help to other asset management companies.","本文探讨了银行与资产管理公司在风险管理含义上的差异，并阐述了为一家意大利中型公司构建风险管理体系时所找到的解决方案。我们描述了资产管理公司在适当金融建模、时间和资源限制方面的特定需求，考虑到投资公司具有以下特点：管理""第三方资金""（潜在损失不构成其负债）；相较于其他市场参与者拥有相对较长的投资期限；通常监测相对风险而非绝对风险。鉴于中长期投资组合风险评估模型至关重要且相关理论问题绝非简单，我们简要介绍了所采用的基于自助法的模型。该模型能计算大量投资组合的多项风险指标，模拟中长期金融场景，无需设定特定概率函数，同时考虑异方差性、序列相关性及现有市场观点。我们简述了系统实施过程，包括数据库与计算引擎（均为市售产品）的若干细节。此类系统比传统银行导向的风险系统更易实施且成本更低：整套工具开发耗时不足一年，成本有限（主要为廉价许可证和两名量化分析师的投入）。希望我们的经验能为其他资产管理公司提供参考。","Risk management, asset management, implementation, bootstrap, historical simulation",2001-02-06

Regardless of these legal aspects, further development steps are often necessary to make risk management a key factor in the success of a company. For example, many companies do not have adequate protection against risks that could threaten their existence, potential for improving planning security remains unused and risk information is only sporadically included in business decisions such as investments. Even in the financial sector, which is subject to strict regulation and has well-developed risk management systems, there is considerable need for action, as the current financial crisis shows.This article describes the current developments in Corporate Risk Management (CRM) and shows where there is room for improvement in (already implemented) risk management systems. Thus, ways to a decision-oriented risk management are shown: Better risk information leads to better business decisions, because unpredictability is also taken into account.",即将实施的第八项欧盟指令，加上持续不断的合规讨论，再次将风险管理的议题推到了企业家们的视野中心。除了这些法律层面的考量外，为了将风险管理打造成为企业成功的关键要素，往往还需进一步的完善措施。例如，许多企业尚未针对威胁生存的风险建立充分保障，提升规划确定性的潜力未被挖掘，而风险信息在投资等商业决策中也仅被零星纳入。即便是受到严格监管、拥有成熟风险管理体系的金融行业，当前金融危机也暴露出其亟需采取行动之处。本文阐述了企业风险管理（CRM）领域的最新动态，并指出已实施的风险管理体系在哪些方面存在改进空间。由此，文章提出了通往决策导向型风险管理的路径：更优质的风险信息能促成更明智的商业决策，因其同时将不可预测性纳入考量。,corporate risk management,2020-05-19

Risk management has long been associated with the use of market insurance to protect individuals and companies from various losses associated with accidents. Other forms of risk management, alternatives to market insurance, surfaced during the 1950s when market insurance was perceived as very costly and incomplete for protection against pure risk. The use of derivatives as risk management instruments arose during the 1970s, and expanded rapidly during the 1980s, as companies intensified their financial risk management. International risk regulation began in the 1980s, and financial firms developed internal risk management models and capital calculation formulas to hedge against unanticipated risks and reduce regulatory capital. Concomitantly, governance of risk management became essential, integrated risk management was introduced and the chief risk officer positions were created.

risk management,"Complexity, Maturity and Competency in the ProjectRiskManagementEnvironment: A Relational Framework",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3354041,Egan Naidoo,"The observed phenomenon is that projects in general are failing, and though professional associations have been upgrading project management standards, methodologies and tools, these efforts have not contributed to a general increase in project management success. Projects, systems, products and services are becoming more complex, which inevitably leads to competency and maturity issues. Constant project failures raise questions about the current project risk management concepts, practices, people, behaviour, contextual, and technology issues required to achieve consistency and the successful delivery of projects.An inquiry into Eskom, South Africa’s dominant electricity generator and supplier, found that the conventional project management processes aggravate the risk of management incompetence when dealing with complex projects where uncertainty and risk are perceived to be higher. When training project risk management practitioners, Eskom does not apply a holistic approach that considers the impact of complexity, maturity and competency on projects and their performance. The skills and competency requirements are not stipulated when the risk advisor moves to a more senior advisory role in low-complexity projects, and from there into high-complexity projects. Eskom’s ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to competency development does not consider the fact that projects have different complexities.The researcher sought to ascertain whether there is a relationship between complexity, maturity and competency in project risk management and if so, to determine whether such a relationship affects the performance of projects.An interpretive and subjective research philosophy was adopted, using inductive reasoning and a qualitative research approach to probe the literature. The researcher applied field research with participative action research for the interviews and a qualitative survey to collect data and verify the findings of the literature review. A semi-structured questionnaire was used for in-depth interviews with six Eskom senior managers. Stratified sampling was used for the collection of data from 207 Eskom project risk management practitioners. They were invited to respond to the web-based survey comprising a questionnaire with multiple-choice questions on project and project risk management. Eighty project risk management practitioners responded to the survey. Further, a checklist of possible project risk management competencies was emailed to project management experts in Eskom and national and international project management associations for their input.Thematic analysis and content analysis were applied as the qualitative method of analysis. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and coded, and the web-based survey responses were categorised, analysed and interpreted to create an analytical narrative about the present project and project risk management situation in Eskom. The themes or commonalities discovered in the literature and field research, as well as the competency unit criteria from the updated checklist, was used to populate three matrices (technical, contextual and behavioural) for comparison purposes.The research findings indicated that project complexity is driven by the interaction of management, systems and the product delivered. All projects have some level of complexity and Eskom should acknowledge differing complexities. Competency development includes the development of technical, contextual and behavioural competencies. Most importantly, there is a notable relationship between complexity, maturity and competency in the project environment. These findings led to the creation of a sense-making framework in which the relationships between the research elements, their sub-elements and project risk management were combined to indicate how such a relationship could lead to the successful execution of projects. The final outcome of the research is a competency framework to guide the development of project risk practitioners.Recommendations from the research findings are that project performance can be improved by constantly enhancing the competencies of project risk practitioners and by introducing a defined career path in which the different types of projects are considered. Eskom should instil a project risk management culture to ensure maturity of the organisation and sensitivity to the varying levels of complexity in projects.","观察到的现象是，项目普遍面临失败，尽管专业协会一直在升级项目管理标准、方法和工具，但这些努力并未推动项目管理成功率的整体提升。项目、系统、产品和服务正变得日益复杂，这不可避免地引发了能力与成熟度问题。持续的项目失败引发了对当前项目风险管理理念、实践、人员、行为、环境及技术问题的质疑——这些要素本应确保项目交付的一致性与成功。对南非主要电力供应商Eskom的调查发现，在处理不确定性和风险更高的复杂项目时，传统项目管理流程会加剧管理失能的风险。Eskom在培训项目风险管理从业者时，并未采用综合考虑复杂性、成熟度及能力对项目及其表现影响的整体方法。当风险顾问从低复杂度项目晋升至高级顾问职位，再进入高复杂度项目时，其技能与能力要求缺乏明确规定。Eskom""一刀切""的能力发展模式忽视了项目复杂程度的差异性。研究者试图验证项目风险管理中复杂性、成熟度与能力之间是否存在关联，并探究这种关联是否影响项目表现。研究采用解释性主观哲学，通过归纳推理与定性方法梳理文献，结合参与式行动研究的实地访谈及定性调查收集数据。半结构化问卷用于对6名Eskom高管的深度访谈，分层抽样则用于收集207名Eskom项目风险管理从业者的数据，其中80人完成了包含多选题的在线调查。另将项目风险管理能力清单通过邮件发送给Eskom及国内外项目管理协会专家征求意见。采用主题分析与内容分析等定性方法处理数据：访谈记录经转录编码，网络调查反馈经分类解析，最终形成关于Eskom当前项目及风险管理现状的分析报告。通过文献与实地研究发现的共性主题，结合更新后的能力清单标准，研究者构建了技术、情境和行为三维矩阵进行对比。研究发现：项目复杂性由管理、系统及交付产品的交互作用驱动；所有项目均存在复杂度差异，Eskom需正视这一点；能力发展应涵盖技术、情境及行为维度；最重要的是，项目环境中复杂性、成熟度与能力存在显著关联。这些发现促成构建意义建构框架，将研究要素及其子要素与项目风险管理的关系整合，揭示其如何推动项目成功实施。最终成果是指导风险从业者发展的能力框架。研究建议：通过持续提升风险从业者能力，并建立考虑项目类型差异的明确职业路径，可改善项目表现；Eskom应培育风险管理文化，以提升组织成熟度及对项目复杂性的敏感度。","Complexity, maturity, competency, project management, risk management",2019-04-12

While effects from bias can often be corrected, it is more difficult to identify and correct for what might be described as noise As expanded upon by Kahneman and others in ""Noise: A Flaw in Human Judgment"" research suggests time of day, outdoor temperature, personal moods, desire to over-correct, and simple randomness can be behind how people arrive at judgmental forecasts and evaluations. This article illustrates the impact of noise on credit ratings and shows how their suggestions for conducting a noise audit, ensuring noise hygiene, and subsequent reduction of noise can be applied to credit risk ratings. The validity of credit risk ratings can improve from the perspective of these findings.

risk management,Guide to EffectiveRiskManagement3.0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3014251,Alex Sidorenko,"Nowadays, risk management is on everyone’s corporate agenda; let it be a private or public organisation. A special attention to risk management is paid by governments, stock exchanges, shareholders and regulators. However, this hasn’t always been the case. We began our risk management research back in 2007. This was the time when most large non-financial corporations were just starting to build risk management functions and implementing risk management frameworks. At the time, our study showed that risk management was largely driven by the stock exchange requirements and was very basic in nature. Today, as we continue to adapt to a highly volatile environment, businesses are becoming more proactive about risk management. Is this just a facade or are organisations truly becoming more risk aware? During our research, we were pleasantly surprised by how many companies have already recognized the limitations of “stand-alone” and “separate” risk management processes and are proactive in integrating risk management into decision-making, core business processes and the overall culture of the organisation. We have collated best practices from more than a dozen mature organisations to propose an alternative approach to risk management. An approach without the heat maps, risk registers, risk frameworks or risk mitigation plans. For several years, we have tested and validated the findings both locally and internationally. Based on our research and the interviews, we have summarized fifteen practical ideas on how to improve the integration of risk management into the daily life of the organisation. These were grouped into three high level objectives: drive risk culture, help integrate risk management into business and become a trusted adviser.

Raising the Bar will provide boards, investors, regulators, ratings agencies, Skilled Persons firms and other stakeholders with a commonly agreed benchmark for “what good looks like” – something not previously available in one place.“Nothing like this currently exists in Europe.” Martin Stewart, former Director of Banking and Building Society Supervision, Prudential Regulation Authority.The Risk Coalition’s aims in producing Raising the Bar are to close major gaps in risk governance and oversight, initially in the UK financial services sector, through:establishing a common understanding of the purpose, role and activities of the board risk committee and risk function; providing a benchmark against which board risk committees and risk functions can be assessed objectively; raising the general standard of risk governance and oversight practice within UK financial services; filling the gap in principles-based good practice risk guidance whilst recognizing the presence of detailed regulation. Raising the Bar’s focus on alignment of organisation purpose, strategy, objectives and risk should lead to the repositioning of the board risk committee as the pre-eminent board committee with a direct influence on overall business performance.Moreover, the Risk Coalition expects that Raising the Bar will encourage increased use of board risk committees, beyond financial services, through clarification of their purpose and ability to add value. Effective risk governance is crucial to sustainability and viability.“We welcome the Risk Coalition’s initiative to raise standards in risk oversight in UK financial services.

Thus, we propose a novel, feedback-based approach to examine risk management decisions. We simulate individuals’ decisions over 50 time periods and analyze how distributional properties of different risk management instruments influence subjects’ propensity to invest in self-insurance or self-protection. Our results show that subjects act more risk averse over time because self-insurance take-up rates increase when learners gain more experience. Individuals’ risk management decisions are price-sensitive but we find only limited evidence for a complementary relationship between both risk management options. Our findings provide an alternative explanation for the low demand for risk management investments against low probability risks and can be used to predict developments in new insurance markets with inexperienced policyholders.",由于缺乏关于风险管理活动有效性的描述性信息，决策者往往不得不依赖（自身）对这些投资的既往经验。为此，我们提出了一种基于反馈的新方法来检验风险管理决策。我们模拟了50个时间段内个体的决策，分析不同风险管理工具的分佈特性如何影响受试者对自我保险或自我保护的投入倾向。结果显示，随着学习者经验积累，自我保险的采纳率上升，受试者会随时间推移表现出更强的风险规避倾向。个体的风险管理决策对价格敏感，但我们仅发现有限证据表明两种风险管理选项存在互补关系。这些发现为低概率风险领域风险管理投资需求低迷现象提供了另一种解释，并可用于预测由缺乏经验的投保人构成的新保险市场发展趋势。,"Learning from experience, Risk Management, Low probability risks",2015-07-10

risk management,Derivatives and CorporateRiskManagement: Participation and Volume Decisions in the Insurance Industry,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=92731,J David Cummins,"The use of derivatives in corporate risk management has grown rapidly in recent years. In this paper, the authors explore the factors that influence the use of financial derivatives in the U.S. insurance industry. Their objective is to investigate the motivations for corporate risk management The authors use regulatory data on individual holdings and transactions in derivative markets. According to modern finance theory, shares of widely held corporations are held by diversified investors who operate in frictionless and complete markets and eliminate non-systematic risk through their portfolio choices. But this theory has been challenged by new hypotheses that take into account market imperfections, information asymmetries and incentive conflicts as motivations for corporate managers to change the risk/return profile of their firm. The authors develop a set of hypotheses regarding the hedging behavior of insurers and perform tests on a sample of life and property-liability insurers to test them. The sample consists of all U.S. life and property-liability insurers reporting to the NAIC. The authors investigate the decision to conduct derivatives transactions and the volume of transactions undertaken. There are two primary theories about the motivations for corporate risk management - maximization of shareholder value and maximization of managerial utility. The authors discuss these theories, the hypotheses they develop from them , and specify variables to test their hypotheses. They posit the following rationales for why corporations may choose to engage in risk management and also specify variables that help them study the use of these rationales by insurance firms: to avoid the costs of financial distress; to hedge part of their investment default/volatility/liquidity risks; to avoid shocks to equity that result in high leverage ratios; to minimize taxes and enhance firm value by reducing the volatility of earnings; to maximize managerial utility. The authors argue that the use of derivatives for speculative purposes in the insurance industry is not common. The authors analyze the decision by insurers to enter the market and their volume of transactions. They use probit analysis to study the participation decision and Tobit analysis along with Cragg's generalization of the Tobit analysis to study volume. The results provide support for the authors' hypothesis that insurers hedge to maximize shareholder value. The analysis provides only weak support for the managerial utility hypothesis. Insurers are motivated to use financial derivatives to reduce the expected costs of financial distress. There is also evidence that insurers use derivatives to hedge asset volatility and exchange rate risks. There is also evidence that there are significant economies of scale in running derivatives operations - only large firms and/or those with higher than average risk exposure find it worthwhile to pay the fixed cost of setting up a derivatives operation. Overall, insurers with higher than average asset risk exposures use derivative securities.","近年来，衍生品在企业风险管理中的运用迅速增长。本文作者探讨了影响美国保险业使用金融衍生品的因素，旨在研究企业风险管理的动机。作者利用监管机构提供的衍生品市场个体持仓与交易数据展开分析。现代金融理论认为，股权分散型企业的股票由多元化投资者持有，这些投资者在无摩擦的完全市场中通过投资组合选择消除非系统性风险。但该理论正受到新假说的挑战——这些假说将市场缺陷、信息不对称和激励冲突视为企业管理者调整公司风险/收益特征的动因。作者针对保险公司的对冲行为提出一系列假设，并通过对寿险与财产责任险公司的样本测试进行验证。研究样本涵盖所有向美国保险监督官协会（NAIC）提交报告的美国寿险及财产责任险公司。作者重点考察了企业开展衍生品交易的决策过程及交易规模。关于企业风险管理动机存在两大主流理论：股东价值最大化理论和管理者效用最大化理论。作者讨论了这些理论及其衍生的假设，并设定变量进行检验。他们提出以下企业可能选择风险管理的理由，同时设定相应变量以研究保险公司对这些理由的运用：规避财务困境成本；对冲部分投资违约/波动性/流动性风险；避免导致高杠杆率的权益冲击；通过降低盈利波动实现节税并提升企业价值；实现管理者效用最大化。作者指出保险业鲜少将衍生品用于投机目的。通过分析保险公司进入衍生品市场的决策与交易规模，作者采用概率单位模型（Probit）研究参与决策，并运用托宾模型（Tobit）及Cragg对托宾模型的推广来研究交易规模。结果支持作者关于""保险公司为股东价值最大化进行对冲""的假设，但对管理者效用假说的支持较弱。研究表明：保险公司运用金融衍生品的主要动机是降低预期财务困境成本；同时存在证据表明其通过衍生品对冲资产波动性与汇率风险；衍生品业务运营具有显著规模效应——仅大型公司和/或风险敞口高于平均水平的企业认为值得支付建立衍生品业务的固定成本。总体而言，资产风险敞口高于平均水平的保险公司更倾向于使用衍生证券。","Derivatives, Risk Management, Insurance Companies",1998-05-27

Due to complexity of factors shaping the economic situation the risk in decision-taking processes in an organization is increasing. These factors induced the author of this paper to trace the changes that took place in the perception of risk by organizations, and consequently the ways of coping with risk. The aim of this paper is to present changes that have occurred in the field of risk management from the crystallization of the conception of risk management up to the latest activities in this area reflected in the standard ISO 31000.",风险管理这一领域不仅越来越多地出现在学术论文中，更重要的是已成为企业运营的必备要求。由于影响经济形势的因素日益复杂，组织决策过程中的风险正不断加剧。这些因素促使本文作者追溯组织对风险认知的演变历程，进而探究应对风险方式的变迁。本文旨在呈现风险管理领域从概念形成到ISO 31000标准所体现的最新实践所发生的变化。,"risk, risk management, evolution, enterprises risk management (ERM)",2012-12-15

risk management,Practical Application of Vector Autoregression Using Impulse Response Function Modeling in the Financial Industry,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5174051,"Dr Aakash Ramchand Dil PhD (Maths) DBA (Risk Management), CQF","Financial markets these days are more tangled than ever, so we really need some clever tools to get a read on how the economy moves. Lots of folks now lean on techniques like Vector Autoregression (VAR) and its sidekick, Impulse Response Function (IRF), since they do a nice job of showing how various time series data connect—even when the links aren’t crystal clear. When analysts use a VAR approach, they often notice that a jolt in one variable sends ripples through others, hinting at effects on spending and lending patterns; this kind of chain reaction, for example, has popped up in studies on intercorporate lending and its knock-on effects on economic balance (Bialek-Jaworska et al., 2020). Lately, there’s been, in most cases, a bit of a comeback in structural macroeconomic forecasting—thanks in part to recent progress in dynamic stochastic general equilibrium theory—which has helped renew interest in these VAR methods (Francis X Diebold). In this write-up, I’ll go over how these models work in practice and why they still matter in everyday financial analysis and decision-making, even when things aren’t perfectly predictable.",如今的金融市场比以往任何时候都更加错综复杂，因此我们确实需要一些聪明的工具来解读经济走势。现在许多人倾向于使用向量自回归（VAR）及其辅助工具脉冲响应函数（IRF）等技术，因为它们能很好地展示各种时间序列数据之间的联系——即使这些关联并不十分清晰。当分析师采用VAR方法时，他们常常注意到一个变量的冲击会波及其他变量，暗示着对支出和借贷模式的影响；例如，这种连锁反应在企业间借贷及其对经济平衡的后续影响研究中已经显现（Bialek-Jaworska等人，2020年）。最近在大多数情况下，结构宏观经济预测有所复苏——部分归功于动态随机一般均衡理论的最新进展——这有助于重新激发人们对这些VAR方法的兴趣（Francis X Diebold）。在本文中，我将探讨这些模型在实际中如何运作，以及为什么它们在日常金融分析和决策中仍然重要，即使事情并非完全可预测。,"vector autoregression, impulse response function, risk management, laggad variables, econometric models, VAR, IRF",2025-03-25

Greenbaum,"This paper amplifies themes growing out of Greenbaum, 2012. That paper presented a framework for thinking about Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). We begin this paper by deconstructing the concepts of risk, risk management and ERM. These are all unsettled ideas, but they have been adapted and deployed in the effort to advance management techniques in public companies and other types of organizations concerned with their mortality. We next explore the distinction between core risks, those that businesses process profitably and ancillary risks, all others that constitute a nuisance in that the firm possesses no special skills in dealing with them. In the final section, we share some normative thoughts about ERM as a process. The perspective is unabashedly that of the board member. At the end of the day, ERM is little more than formality designed to reduce the threat of terminal hazards, hazards that tend to be ignored in the normal course of events.",本文深化了Greenbaum 2012年提出的议题。该论文曾提出一个思考企业风险管理（ERM）的框架。我们首先解构风险、风险管理和ERM的概念。这些都是尚未定论的理念，但已被采纳并应用于提升上市公司及其他关注存续问题的组织的管理技术。接着我们探讨核心风险（企业能从中盈利的业务风险）与附属风险（企业无特殊应对能力、构成经营困扰的其他风险）之间的区别。最后部分，我们分享关于ERM流程的规范性思考，毫不掩饰地从董事会成员的视角出发。归根结底，ERM不过是一种旨在减少致命威胁的形式化程序——那些在日常运营中容易被忽视的终极风险。,"Risk Management, Enterprise Risk Management, ERM, Financial Intermediation",2013-04-21
risk management,RiskAnalysis andRiskManagementfor the Artificial Superintelligence Research and Development Process,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2807358,Anthony Barrett,"Artificial superintelligence (ASI) is increasingly recognized as a significant future risk. In the absence of adequate safety mechanisms, an ASI may even be likely to cause human extinction. Thus ASI risk scenarios merit attention even if their probabilities are low. ASI risk can be addressed in at least two ways: by building safety mechanisms into the ASI itself, as in ASI safety research, and by managing the human process of developing ASI, in order to promote safety practices in ASI research and development (R&D). While ASI researchers and developers typically do not intend to cause harm through their work, harm may nonetheless occur due to accidents and unintended consequences. Thus opportunities may exist to reduce ASI risk through engagement with the R&D process. This paper surveys established methodologies for risk analysis and risk management, emphasizing fault trees and event trees, and describes how these techniques can be applied to risk from ASI R&D. A variety of risk methodologies have been developed for other risks, including other emerging technology risks, but their application to ASI has thus far been limited. Insights from risk literatures could improve on what existing analyses of ASI risk have yet been conducted. Likewise, a more thorough and rigorous analysis of ASI R&D processes can inform decision making to reduce the risk. The decision makers include governments and non-governmental organizations active in ASI oversight, as well anyone conducting ASI R&D. All of these individuals and groups have roles to play in addressing ASI risk.",人工超级智能（ASI）日益被视为未来的一项重大风险。在缺乏足够安全机制的情况下，ASI甚至可能导致人类灭绝。因此即便发生概率较低，ASI风险情景仍值得关注。应对ASI风险至少存在两种途径：一是在ASI内部构建安全机制（如ASI安全研究领域所做的那样），二是通过管理人类开发ASI的进程来促进其研发过程中的安全实践。尽管ASI研究者与开发者通常无意通过其工作造成伤害，但事故和意外后果仍可能导致危害发生。因此通过介入研发流程来降低ASI风险存在可行性。本文梳理了风险分析与风险管理的成熟方法论（重点包括故障树与事件树），并阐述如何将这些技术应用于ASI研发风险。针对其他风险（包括其他新兴技术风险）已发展出多种风险分析方法，但迄今在ASI领域的应用仍有限。来自风险研究文献的洞见可改进现有ASI风险分析的不足。同样，对ASI研发流程进行更全面严谨的分析，能为降低风险的决策提供依据。这些决策者包括积极参与ASI监管的政府与非政府组织，以及所有从事ASI研发的实体。所有这些个体与群体在应对ASI风险中都扮演着重要角色。,"risk analysis, risk management, artificial intelligence",2016-07-15

By analysing the balance sheet of a small Italian bank during the years 2009 and 2010, we outlined its liquidity profile, the variables that influenced its dynamics and their effects on the bank’s global management, with particular attention to the interest margin and the interest rate risk in the banking book. We would like to fill a gap identified in the literature, shedding light on how a set of decisions designed mainly to reduce the liquidity risk and comply with the new parameters established by the Basel III Framework enables a more effective management of the regulatory capital and helps the bank to achieve a solid balance between profitability and solvency. Our main findings demonstrate that the bank succeeded in modifying its liquidity profile in order to comply with the incoming constraints imposed by the Basel III framework; the actions taken to reduce the liquidity risk also lowered its interest margin, but also enabled the bank to reduce the amount of capital absorbed by the interest rate risk, giving rise to a globally positive effect.",本研究旨在确定信贷机构的流动性风险与利率风险之间是否存在关联。通过分析一家意大利小型银行2009至2010年间的资产负债表，我们勾勒出该行的流动性状况、影响其动态变化的变量及其对银行整体管理的影响，尤其关注银行账簿中的净息差与利率风险。我们试图填补现有文献的空白，揭示一系列主要为降低流动性风险并满足《巴塞尔协议III》新规要求的决策，如何能更有效地管理监管资本，并帮助银行在盈利性与偿付能力之间实现稳固平衡。主要研究结果表明：该银行成功调整了流动性状况以符合《巴塞尔协议III》即将实施的约束要求；降低流动性风险的相关举措虽减少了净息差，但同时减少了利率风险所占用的资本金额，从而产生了整体积极效应。,"Asset and Liability Management, Basel III Framework, Integration of Liquidity Risk and Interest Rate Risk, Risk Management",2012-09-28

We take a pragmatic-constructivist stance to explore how such a tool might be integrated in actor-based Management Control Systems Using risk management as an example. We propose a conceptual framework and a research agenda that accounts for actorship (Nørreklit, 2013) beyond numerical facts. Methodology: This paper is conceptual and draws on secondary literature. Findings: Our framework highlights the non-linear, iterative nature of integrating calculative practices that specifically require complex reflection concerning the [1] validation if possibilities are factual (combining subjective and numerical data), [2] the elimination of illusions and sur-realities through constructive conflict/dialectical management, and [3] the co-construction of organization-wide topoi (causality and pertinent accounting practices). Limitations: We emphasize that the pragmatics in our approach dictate that construct causality is not universal, so that actors have to be reflective when applying this framework. Originality: Our research furthers practice research on calculative practices through the development of a prescriptive rather than descriptive framework. It also offers propositions that future case study researchers can use.","目的：我们探讨计算实践基于同时包含主观与客观成分的社会建构事实这一问题。采用实用主义-建构主义立场，以风险管理为例，研究如何将此类工具整合至基于行动者的管理控制系统中。我们提出了一个超越数字事实、涵盖行动主体性（Nørreklit, 2013）的概念框架与研究议程。方法：本文为概念性研究，基于二手文献。发现：我们的框架强调整合计算实践的非线性、迭代特性，尤其需要围绕以下方面进行复杂反思：[1]验证可能性是否为事实（结合主观与客观数据）；[2]通过建设性冲突/辩证管理消除幻想与超现实；[3]共同构建组织范围内的共识基础（因果关系及相关会计实践）。局限：我们强调该方法中的实用性要求建构的因果关系并非普适，因此行动者在应用此框架时需保持反思性。创新：本研究通过开发规范性而非描述性框架，推进了计算实践的实践研究，并为未来案例研究者提供了可验证的命题。","Management control systems, risk management, pragmatic constructivism; calculative practice, practice theory",2016-03-28

It develops the new framework of Model Risk Arbitrage for profit-maximization in the emerging global financial markets characterized by unprecedented uncertainty, complexity, and, rapid discontinuous changes. It develops the new framework of ‘Open Systems Finance’ aligned with George Soros’ Reflexivity Theory based upon empirical practical experience in financial markets as contrasted from ‘Closed Systems Finance’ models characterizing most of classical and academic Finance and Economics theory. Aligning with George Soros’ Reflexivity Theory and associated Hegelian Dialectic, it characterizes ‘reflexivity’ as the missing link in Finance theory, research, and, practice that can help understand the effect of feedback and feedforward loops across Time and Space in information-based non-deterministic ‘open systems’ Finance. Consistently, it is based on the Hegelian Dialectic characterizing the [profit-maximizing] Black Hat approach as compared with the [risk-optimizing] White Hat approach. The Black Hat approach exploits all vulnerabilities at all levels of all systems to maximize advantage over the White Hat approach. Similarly, Model Risk Arbitrage exploits all model risks at all levels of all systems to maximize advantage over Model Risk Management. Open Systems Finance framework advances beyond ‘silo’ based mindsets characterizing academic theory and practices and thus serves as foundation for developing and executing Model Risk Arbitrage strategies for profit-maximization. The current presentation advances upon last two decades of our applied and industrial research and global practices on post-WWW era management and modeling frameworks of uncertainty and risk management. It builds upon our research and practices on designing self-adaptive complex systems for high velocity hyper-turbulent environments characterized by high uncertainty.  The 2016 invited presentation is the sequel to the 2015 invited presentation at the Princeton Quant Trading Conference which advanced Frank Knight’s (1921) original treatise developing the foundation of Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit for the Cyber Era.  The 2015 presentation laid the foundation for examining modeling and management of ‘true uncertainty’ which is distinct from [theoretical] risk and “which forms the basis of a valid theory of profit and accounts for the divergence between actual and theoretical competition” (Knight 1921). That presentation further advanced upon prior research in collaboration with world’s distinguished cybersecurity experts affiliated with the Air Force Research Lab and Wall Street’s leading risk management experts from top investment banks such as JP Morgan. That work developed the original basis for understanding emerging Cyber Finance practices at the intersection of leading-edge developments in both Finance and Cybersecurity related risk and uncertainty management. In addition, it also developed robust computational quantitative finance modeling foundations for industrywide Cyber Risk Insurance Modeling practices.","2016年普林斯顿量化交易会议特邀研究报告提出了两项金融创新及其相互关系：面向""开放系统金融""的""模型风险套利""。该研究构建了""模型风险套利""新框架，旨在以前所未有的不确定性、复杂性和快速不连续变化为特征的新兴全球金融市场中实现利润最大化。研究同时发展了与乔治·索罗斯反身性理论相契合的""开放系统金融""新框架，该框架基于金融市场实证经验，有别于表征传统学院派金融经济理论的""封闭系统金融""模型。研究将""反身性""定位为金融理论、研究与实践领域缺失的关键环节，结合黑格尔辩证法与索罗斯反身性理论，阐释了这种基于信息的非确定性""开放系统""金融中跨越时空的反馈与前馈循环效应。研究采用黑格尔辩证法，将利润最大化的""黑帽策略""与风险优化的""白帽策略""进行对比——黑帽策略通过利用各系统层面的所有漏洞来最大化对白帽策略的优势，同理，模型风险套利通过利用各系统层面的所有模型风险来最大化对模型风险管理的优势。开放系统金融框架突破了学术理论与实践中常见的""孤岛思维""，为开发与执行利润最大化的模型风险套利策略奠定基础。本次报告基于我们过去二十年在后互联网时代管理与风险建模框架的应用研究及全球实践，延续了针对高不确定性超湍流环境设计自适应复杂系统的研究成果。作为2015年普林斯顿量化交易会议特邀报告的续篇，本次报告进一步发展了弗兰克·奈特(1921)关于网络时代风险、不确定性与利润基础的开创性论述。2015年报告为区分于(理论)风险的""真实不确定性""建模与管理研究奠定基础——奈特指出这种不确定性""构成了利润有效理论的基础，并解释了实际竞争与理论竞争的差异""。该研究曾与美国空军研究实验室顶尖网络安全专家及摩根大通等顶级投行风险管理专家合作，为理解金融与网络安全交叉领域的前沿风险管理实践建立了理论基础，同时为行业级网络风险保险建模实践奠定了稳健的计算量化金融建模基础。","Princeton Quant Trading Conference, model risk arbitrage, open systems finance, model risk management, global financial markets, Knightian uncertainty & risk management, self-adaptive complex systems, hyper-turbulent environments, black swans, extreme events, Reflexivity Theory, Hegelian Dialectic",2016-04-25
risk management,"A Review onRiskManagementin Information Systems:RiskPolicy, Control and Fraud Detection",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4178697,Hamed Taherdoost,"Businesses are bombarded with great deals of risks, vulnerabilities, and unforeseen business interruptions in their lifetime, which negatively affect their productivity and sustainability within the market. Such risks require a risk management system to identify risks and risk factors and propose approaches to eliminate or reduce them. Risk management involves highly structured practices that should be implemented within an organization, including organizational planning documents. Continuity planning and fraud detection policy development are among the many critically important practices conducted through risk management that aim to mitigate risk factors, their vulnerability, and their impact. Information systems play a pivotal role in any organization by providing many benefits, such as reducing human errors and associated risks owing to the employment of sophisticated algorithms. Both the development and establishment of an information system within an organization contributes to mitigating business-related risks and also creates new types of risks associated with its establishment. Businesses must prepare for, react to, and recover from unprecedented threats that might emerge in the years or decades that follow. This paper provides a comprehensive narrative review of risk management in information systems coupled with its application in fraud detection and continuity planning.",企业在存续期间会面临大量风险、漏洞和不可预见的业务中断，这些负面因素会削弱其生产力和市场可持续性。此类风险需要借助风险管理体系来识别风险因素，并提出消除或降低风险的解决方案。风险管理包含一系列高度结构化的实践措施，应通过组织规划文件等形式在企业内部落实。其中，业务连续性规划和反欺诈政策制定是风险管理的核心实践，旨在降低风险因素的脆弱性及其影响。信息系统通过运用复杂算法减少人为错误及相关风险，为各类组织提供关键支撑。但信息系统的开发建设在降低业务风险的同时，也会带来新型风险。企业必须为未来数十年可能出现的突发威胁做好预防、应对和恢复准备。本文系统综述了信息系统的风险管理及其在反欺诈和连续性规划中的应用。,information systems; risk management; risk assessment; fraud detection; risk control; risk policy; continuity planning,2022-08-10
risk management,"Book Review of CreditRisk: Pricing, Measurement, andManagement",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=600545,Georges Dionne,"Credit risk is the major challenge for risk managers and market regulators. Banks, regulators and central banks do not agree on how to measure credit risk and, more particularly, on how to compute the optimal capital that is necessary for protecting the different partners that share this risk. Asking banks to keep too much capital in reserve to cover credit risk can be a source of market distortion in risk management behavior. All these issues arise in part because credit risk is not well understood. So the contribution of Duffie and Singleton will be welcomed by the academics, regulators, and practitioners who consult it. The book has thirteen chapters, three appendices (two on affine processes), a comprehensive list of references, and an index (authors and subjects). It covers all subjects related to credit risk. The main focus is modeling credit risk: measuring portfolio credit risk and pricing different securities exposed to credit risk. The focus on credit risk management is less important. The book covers with great clarity the relevant topics of credit risk. It reflects the strong academic competence of the authors. This is certainly the best reference on credit risk available on the market. I recommend the book to academics and professionals, and also for the teaching of credit risk at Masters and PhD levels in finance and economics.",信用风险是风险经理和市场监管者面临的主要挑战。银行、监管机构和中央银行在如何衡量信用风险，尤其是如何计算保护风险分担各方所需的最优资本方面存在分歧。要求银行留存过多资本以覆盖信用风险，可能导致风险管理行为的市场扭曲。这些问题的出现部分源于人们对信用风险的理解尚不充分。因此，达菲和辛格尔顿的著作将受到学术界、监管机构和从业者的欢迎。全书共十三章，含三个附录（其中两个涉及仿射过程）、详尽的参考文献列表及作者与主题索引，涵盖了信用风险相关所有议题。核心内容聚焦信用风险建模：包括投资组合信用风险度量及信用风险相关证券定价。信用风险管理并非本书重点。该书以极高清晰度阐述了信用风险关键课题，彰显了作者深厚的学术造诣。这无疑是当前市场上最权威的信用风险参考著作。我向学术界与专业人士强烈推荐此书，同时也建议将其用于金融经济领域硕士及博士阶段的信用风险教学。,"Credit risk, pricing, measurement, management",2004-10-08

We provide a structured and substantiated way of conceptualizing ERM that captures and organizes the already existing discourse. We propose that there are essentially three dimensions of ERM: governance, integration, and strategy. In a further refinement, we propose a categorization of six underlying incentives for ERM: to, (i) achieve risk oversight, (ii) provide structure to the risk management system, (iii) increase organizational risk awareness, (iv) manage portfolios of risk, (v) develop strategy, and (vi) improve strategic decision-making.",企业风险管理项目正大规模且坚定地转向企业全面风险管理（ERM）系统，但现有文献仍缺乏对ERM激励因素/益处的清晰结构化描述。我们提出了一种结构化且可验证的ERM概念化方法，对现有论述进行了系统梳理。我们认为ERM本质上包含三个维度：治理、整合与战略。进一步细分后，我们提出六项基础激励因素分类：（一）实现风险监督；（二）构建风险管理体系框架；（三）提升组织风险意识；（四）管理风险组合；（五）制定战略；（六）优化战略决策。,"enterprise risk management, governance, strategy, integration",2017-11-17

risk management,Weather Derivative Pricing andRiskManagement: Volatility and Value atRisk,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=405802,Stephen Jewson,"Weather derivatives are financial contracts that allow entities to hedge themselves against the adverse impacts of fluctuations in the weather. The pricing of such contracts is based on a combination of actuarial and arbitrage methods. Risk management of portfolios of weather derivatives centres on the estimation of two distributions: the expiry distribution and the short term risk distribution. These distributions can be used to calculate the expiry VaR and the VaR, respectively. The expiry distribution can be estimated relatively easily using the actuarial methods used to price contracts and manage portfolios. The short term risk distribution, however, is much more difficult to estimate since it depends on market dynamics and the statistics of changes in probabilistic meteorological forecasts. Nevertheless, we show that, under certain reasonable assumptions, the short term risk distribution for a large class of standard contracts takes a particularly simple form. It depends on a single volatility that can be derived without having to perform any statistical analysis of past forecasts. In addition we show that the framework we develop for calculating the short term risk distribution leads to a simple method for the actuarial valuation of options during the contract period.",天气衍生品是一种金融合约，允许实体对冲天气波动带来的不利影响。此类合约的定价基于精算与套利方法的结合。天气衍生品组合的风险管理核心在于对两种分布的估算：到期分布与短期风险分布。这两种分布可分别用于计算到期风险价值（VaR）和风险价值（VaR）。利用定价合约和管理组合的精算方法，到期分布相对容易估算。然而短期风险分布的估算则困难得多，因为它取决于市场动态和概率气象预报变化的统计特性。尽管如此，我们证明在特定合理假设下，大量标准合约的短期风险分布具有特别简单的形式——其仅取决于单一波动率参数，且无需对历史预测数据进行统计分析即可推导得出。此外，我们提出的短期风险分布计算框架还能衍生出合约期间期权精算估值的简易方法。,"weather derivatives, weather risk, risk management, value at risk, VaR, expiry value at risk, expiry VaR, seasonal value at risk, seasonal VaR, weather volatility, short term risk",2003-07-25

risk management,Beyond ‘Bayesian vs. Var’ Dilemma to Empirical ModelRiskManagement: ManagingRiskfor Hedge Funds,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2538401,Yogesh Malhotra,"In aftermath of the Financial Crisis, some risk management practitioners advocate wider adoption of Bayesian inference to replace Value-at-Risk (VaR) models for minimizing risk failures (Borison & Hamm, 2010). They claim reliance of Bayesian inference on subjective judgment, the key limitation of Bayesian  methodology as underscored by statisticians (Kass & Raftery, 1995; Kruschke, 2011; Lynch, 2007), as the most significant advantage compared with VaR (Christoffersen, 2012). Despite its well-known limitations, just like all other quantitative models (Derman, 1996; Morini, 2011), VaR – [mostly] non-Bayesian and [increasingly] Bayesian – continues to be a key methodological foundation of risk management and regulation related risk modeling practices in global Finance (Danielsson et al., 2014; Zangari, 1996). Bayesian inference modeling and VaR modeling frameworks are outlined to facilitate model risk management (Derman, 1996; Morini, 2011; US Fed & OCC, 2011) for minimizing risk of any model – Bayesian, VaR, or Bayesian VaR. VaR frameworks are empirically applied for hedge fund risk modeling (Darbyshire & Hampton, 2012, 2014) of a multi-asset fund of funds portfolio of a large Wall Street investment bank. Multiple risk models and measures with transparent assumptions to cross-validate convergent findings across multiple levels of risk analysis are examined for empirical model risk management.Journal granted non-exclusive copyright to publish the article: Author retains all copyrights:Malhotra, Yogesh.

Research indicates that cultural proximity between lenders and borrowers can significantly influence credit dynamics, reducing default rates and facilitating better repayment outcomes(Fisman R et al., 2017). Moreover, the rise of advanced financial instruments has introduced complexity into how credit risks are evaluated, suggesting an urgent need for frameworks that account for these evolving conditions(Marti G Subrahmanyam et al., 2014).

Design/methodology/approach − This conceptual paper synthesizes ERM research and practice from multiple disciplines. Findings − Corporate risk management concepts were born in academic finance and developed further in the finance subset known as risk management and insurance. With the advent of ERM, efforts must broaden beyond applying statistical models to quantifiable risks. Other disciplines have expanded ERM research by embracing techniques to investigate risk management practices to produce knowledge that integrates practice and theory. ERM is promoted as integrated risk management, yet silos still remain in both practice and research. Originality/value − Provides a foundation and a proposal for moving ERM past academic and organizational silos, which is necessary to achieve the ERM philosophy and increase organizational resilience. Understanding the evolution and fragmented nature of ERM research and practice provides a foundation for interdisciplinary cooperation necessary to achieve the holistic ERM philosophy.

Yet, empirical evidence on their effects on inventory is lacking.  We use a fine-grained data set comprising the financial and operational risk management decisions of gold miners from 2003 to 2011 to empirically assess the effects of risk management on inventory.  Faced with volatile gold prices, miners may manage (output) risk financially by committing to sell future gold production and lock in prices.  They may also manage (input) costs operationally by varying the quality of ore they extract and process, thereby altering the costs they incur and influencing inventory holdings.  In addition to affecting profitability, we show that these two risk management strategies have implications for inventory holdings. We find that a one-standard deviation increase in financial risk management (FRM) is associated with an 14.3% decrease in inventory, as FRM decreases the option value of delaying processing inventory. On the other hand, a one-standard deviation increase in operational risk management (ORM) is associated with a 3.5% increase in inventory.

Information about Greece is scarce and fragmented, but the inability by European authorities to understand the incredible mismanagement strongly disappoints the taxpayer. The relevant exposure of European banks in the bond market toward the default risk of Greece supports the need for hedging tools, such as Credit Default Swaps. However, there is evidence that the CDS market on Greek sovereign bonds is segmented, and contracts are mis-priced. The lack of comprehensive data on CDS and other OTC contracts impedes any further investigation.

risk management,RiskAccounting: TheRiskData Aggregation andRiskReporting (BCBS 239) Foundation of EnterpriseRiskManagement(ERM) andRiskGovernance,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2726638,Allan D. Grody,"In the period following the global financial crisis high profile regulatory breaches and other instances of banks’ misconduct triggered widespread concern that the culture and standards of conduct in banks had declined to a point of unacceptability. The crisis also brought into sharp focus the inability of banks to completely and accurately report the risks they accept in order to create shareholder value. These events and circumstances culminated in a crisis of trust between banks and their stakeholders that include governments, regulators, investors and customers. In this same period regulators focused on their primary ‘capital-at-risk’ regimes administered through the Basel capital accords, reinforcing additional levels of capital as a bank’s primary protection against unexpected losses. At the same time Basel introduced ‘firm-at-risk’ mandates that required improvements in banks’ control over risk data and associated technology infrastructure. The most significant game changing post-crisis regulatory mandate in this regard is the Basel Committee’s principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting also known as ‘BCBS 239’. This new mandate requires banks: to implement controls over risk data that are as robust as those applicable to accounting data; to create accurate and single authoritative sources of risk data; and to ensure the precision, timeliness, comprehensiveness and adaptability of risk reporting. BCBS 239 effectively sets the parameters for enterprise risk management (ERM) and provides the foundation on which risk governance and risk cultures can positively evolve. Whereas BCBS 239 expressly states that a common risk metric for all forms of risk is not required, the authors challenge this thinking and argue that it is only through the adoption of a common risk metric that the objectives of BCBS 239 can be reasonably achieved. Part 1 of this paper explains why bankers – risk managers and accountants in particular – must view the need for the convergence of finance and risk systems within a common control and reporting framework as an imperative.

Since cement is manufactured through an energy-intensive process, the focus is on energy price risk. HC has been taken by surprise by soaring energy prices in Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 2018. This has led to (repeated) downgrades of their outlook but no upward move on the learning curve. Instead, HC bets on falling energy prices for the future despite being no expert in these markets. Thus, shareholders are getting a big short position in energy on top of being long cement. Only the latter confirms to the business purpose of HC. HC is not clear on this and equity analysts seem to have little interest neither. No sensitivities to energy prices are reported. Hence, for HC there are more steps to go towards state-of-the-art CRM.",根据HC最新的年度报告，我们对其风险管理进行了核查。由于水泥生产属于高能耗过程，能源价格风险成为关注重点。HC在2018年第一、二、三、四季度连续遭遇能源价格飙升的意外冲击，这导致其业绩展望（多次）被下调，但并未推动其风险管理能力的提升。相反，尽管并非能源市场专家，HC仍押注未来能源价格将下跌。这使得股东在持有水泥多头的同时，实质上还持有了能源的空头头寸——唯有前者符合HC的企业宗旨。HC对此缺乏清醒认知，股权分析师似乎也兴趣寥寥。报告中未披露任何针对能源价格的敏感性分析。由此可见，HC要达成一流的全面风险管理仍有很长的路要走。,"corporate risk management, commodity risk management, energy price risk, hedging, HeidelbergCement",2019-05-22

Next, we surveyed two focused groups (members of Supply Chain Thought Leaders and International Supply Chain Risk Management groups) with open-ended questions. Finally, we surveyed operations and supply chain management researchers during the 2009 INFORMS meeting in San Diego. Our findings characterize the diversity in terms of three “gaps”: a definition gap in how researchers define SCRM, a process gap in terms of inadequate coverage of response to risk incidents, and a methodology gap in terms of inadequate use of empirical methods.

First of all, credit risk in the large corporate sector has decreased significantly after turmoil in the corporate bond market in 1999 and 2000. Second, credit risk in the small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) sector has been continuously deteriorating. Third, credit risk in the household sector has increased. Over-supply of credit by large financial institutions in early 2000s had created near crisis in this sector in 2003. The market stabilized rather quickly, but fast increase of residential mortgage loans by commercial banks had triggered new concerns in recent years. Korean financial institutions have in general made remarkable progresses in improving risk management practices. The supervisory authorities (FSC/FSS) had exerted very strong influences on financial institutions to prompt improvements in their risk management functions. As a result, many of the large financial institutions have made noticeable progresses in adopting advanced risk management technologies and risk-based decision making procedures, even medium- and small-sized financial institutions have been rather slow in progress. Due to lack of experience and insufficient dada, however, many financial institutions are still struggling to fully utilize new risk management technologies. Proactive supervisory measures have become ever more important to maintain soundness and safety of the financial system, because most of large financial institutions still pursue similar asset-origination strategies. Early adoption of Basel II and similar risk-based supervisory criteria and strict implementation of Pillar 3 will be essential to maintain stability of the financial markets.

risk management,CreditMetrics Methodology and Credit Value atRisk(Credit VaR),https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3783490,Yogesh Malhotra,"Financial institutions are subject to many sources of risk, where risk often represents the degree of uncertainty about future net returns. Credit Risk can result in potential loss due to the inability of a counterparty to meet its obligations and is a function of the credit exposure, the probability of default and the loss in the event of default. For a given credit instrument portfolio of Credit obligations such as a portfolio of corporate bonds or swaps, Credit Value-at-Risk (VaR) quantifies how much at most can be lost with a given probability over a specific time horizon (Malhotra 2015). The associated CreditMetrics Methodology, originally introduced in 1997 by JP Morgan has become the “de facto industry standard” along with Credit VaR for credit risk modeling among global financial institutions as well as their regulators (Malhotra 2022). Described by Hull (2011 and 2012) as ‘a procedure for calculating credit value at risk’, CreditMetrics methodology (RiskMetrics Group, 2007) is used for assessing portfolio risk due to changes in bond or debt value caused by credit quality changes, including credit migration (upgrades and downgrades) as well as default. It measures the uncertainty in forward value of the bond portfolio at the risk horizon caused by such credit events. By distinguishing high quality well-diversified portfolios from low-quality concentrated portfolios, CreditMetrics offers better understanding of credit risk in terms of diversification benefits and concentration risk compared to standard capital adequacy measures.Pre-Print of the Journal Paper Submitted on Acceptance of Article for Journal Publication:Journal granted non-exclusive copyright to publish the article: Author retains all copyrights:Malhotra, Yogesh.

Instead, the reputational risk is an evaluative function of information gathered about dangers and threats, relative for each person, and exists in the manager's mind and disclosures that enter in a communication system of rumors, news, and reports that spread believes about organizations.Practical implications – Practitioners and academics in risk management can use this new proposal to enhance their understanding of reputational risk and propose new ways for its identification, measurement, evaluation, and management in the frame of corporate reports and disclosures.Social implications – Regulatory agencies and international organizations like the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel), International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), Comité Européen des Assurances (CEA), and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), among others, can review their definitions to incorporate new insight into the concept of reputational risk.Originality/value – Based on the frame of social epistemology of Alvin Goldman (2010) and Niklas Luhmann's (2006) sociology of risk, this research provides an epistemic discussion absent in the previous literature to advance a robust conceptualization of reputational risk for scholars, practitioners and regulatory agencies.","目的——通过探讨不同领域现有定义，引入社会学和认识论方法，为组织管理提供更丰富的概念框架，从而提出理解声誉风险本质与表现的新视角。  . 设计/方法论/路径——批判性分析2000至2019年间百科全书、非学术书籍杂志、规范性法律文件和学术文献中的声誉风险定义，结合管理者调研数据，提出组织管理中长期忽视的新路径以构建全新概念框架。  . 研究发现——声誉风险既非利益相关者因负面评价产生的认知变化，亦非引发负面认知的事件链，而是关于危险与威胁信息收集的评价函数。这种风险具有个体差异性，存在于管理者意识中，并通过谣言、新闻和报告等传播组织信念的沟通系统进行披露。  . 实践意义——风险管理从业者和学者可运用这一新框架深化对声誉风险的理解，在企业报告与披露框架内探索识别、测量、评估和管理声誉风险的新方法。  . 社会意义——巴塞尔银行监管委员会、国际保险监督官协会、欧洲保险委员会、特许管理会计师公会等监管机构与国际组织可据此修订定义，将声誉风险概念的新见解纳入考量。  . 原创性/价值——基于阿尔文·戈德曼（2010）的社会认识论框架与尼克拉斯·卢曼（2006）的风险社会学理论，本研究首次在文献中引入认识论探讨，为学者、从业者和监管机构提供了更坚实的声誉风险概念化基础。  . . （注：根据用户要求，译文严格遵循了""不添加任何解释或注释""的指令，仅对原文进行了中文转换。专业术语如""stakeholders""译为""利益相关者""、""epistemology""译为""认识论""等均采用学界通用译法，机构名称保留官方中文译名。）","Reputational risk, risk management, social epistemology, concept development, collective belief.",2023-06-16

However, business practice seems to fail with this task. This paper investigates antecedents which foster proactive SCRM implementation from a contingency theory perspective. As a major contingency we choose past supplier insolvencies as an indicator for the level of vulnerability of organisations and investigate inter-organisational, intra-organisational, and individual antecedents. By consulting supply chain management and management accounting literature, hypotheses are developed and tested via content analysis in 63 interviews with representatives from the automotive industry. The findings demonstrate that a mechanistic management control system, a rational cognitive style and relational buyer-supplier relationships have positive impacts on proactively managing supplier insolvency risks. Furthermore, past experience with supplier insolvencies has a moderating, though not a direct, effect on proactiveness. This research suggests that a holistic risk management approach is required to proactively mitigate supplier insolvency risk.",由于供应商破产是供应链中断的主要原因，学者们一直建议主动实施供应链风险管理（SCRM）以避免其发生。然而，商业实践似乎未能完成这一任务。本文从权变理论视角出发，探究了推动主动实施SCRM的前因变量。我们选择过往供应商破产事件作为组织脆弱性水平的主要权变指标，并研究了组织间、组织内及个体层面的前因变量。通过梳理供应链管理和管理会计文献，研究提出假设并采用内容分析法对汽车行业代表的63份访谈数据进行验证。结果表明：机械式管理控制系统、理性认知风格以及买方-供应商关系对主动管理供应商破产风险具有积极影响；此外，过往供应商破产经历虽不直接作用于主动性，但能发挥调节效应。本研究指出，需采用全面风险管理方法才能主动降低供应商破产风险。,"supply chain risk management, contingency theory, management control systems, buyer-supplier relationships, insolvency, content analysis, multi-method",2013-08-07

A case study of one of the UK's largest retailers, Tesco plc, is used to show how ERM can be introduced as part of an existing strategic control system.

trade,A New Look at the ExtensiveTradeMargin Effects ofTradeFacilitation,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2511573,Cosimo Beverelli,"We estimate the effects of trade facilitation on extensive margins of trade. Using OECD Trade Facilitation Indicators – which closely reflect the Trade Facilitation Agreement negotiated at the Bali WTO Ministerial Conference of December 2013 – we show that trade facilitation in a given exporting country is positively correlated with the number of products exported by destination and with the number of export destinations served by product. To address the issue of causality, we employ an identification strategy whereby only exports of new products, or exports to new destinations, are taken into account when computing the respective margins of trade. Our findings therefore imply a positive causal impact of trade facilitation on the country-level extensive margins of trade. The results are, to a large extent, robust to alternative definitions of country-level trade margins, to different sets of controls variables and to various estimation methods. Simulating the effect of an increase to the regional or global median values of trade facilitation, we are able to quantify the potential extensive margin gains of trade facilitation reform in different regions.",我们评估了贸易便利化对贸易扩展边际的影响。利用经合组织贸易便利化指标（该指标紧密反映了2013年12月巴厘岛世贸组织部长级会议达成的《贸易便利化协定》），我们证明出口国的贸易便利化水平与按目的地划分的出口产品数量、以及按产品划分的出口目的地数量均呈正相关。为解决因果关系问题，我们采用了一种识别策略——在计算相应贸易边际时，仅考虑新产品的出口或对新目的地的出口。因此，研究结果表明贸易便利化对国家层面贸易扩展边际具有积极的因果效应。这些结论在采用不同的国家层面贸易边际定义、不同的控制变量组合以及多种估计方法时，均表现出较强的稳健性。通过模拟将贸易便利化水平提升至区域或全球中位值的效果，我们量化了不同地区实施贸易便利化改革可能带来的扩展边际收益。,"Trade facilitation, Export diversification, International trade agreements, WTO",2014-10-20
trade,The Shifting Contours ofTradein Knowledge: The New 'Trade-Related Aspects' of Intellectual Property,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3972110,Antony Scott Taubman,"This paper charts the evolution and diversification of trade in knowledge that has taken place in the quarter-century since the WTO TRIPS Agreement came into force. Entirely new markets have come into being, potentially redefining the very character of 'trade'. The disruptive effect of digital technology has led to much of the content - formerly conceived of as 'added value' embedded in physical carrier media, traded and measured as 'goods' – can be traded in the form of specific licences that use IP rights covering the content that is increasingly accessed online in digital form.These new forms of exchange in valuable intangible content confront fundamental assumptions about the nature of trade and its interaction with the IP system, forcing a rethink of what constitutes the 'trade-related aspects' of intellectual property. The issues examined include the principle of territoriality of IP rights and the segmentation of markets according to national jurisdictions; the structuring of cross-border commercial exchanges into the two discrete categories of 'goods' and 'services'; the emerging disparity in regional trade agreements between provisions on digital IP standards and on digital products and e-commerce; and the significance of IP rights being treated as assets in investment treaties. Whatever formal or legal overlay is applied to these new trading arrangements – it is essential to understand that this is now trade in IP licences as such, rather than trade in goods that have an IP component as an adjunct or ancillary element. TRIPS came about at a time when economic growth theory incorporated intangible knowledge as an endogenous factor, rather than maintaining it as exogenous to models of growth. Trade policy must similarly work to incorporate an understanding of the trade in IP licences itself within cross-border commercial exchanges as an integral element of international trading relations: sale and licensing of IP rights can then be considered 'endogenous' to trade. This is essential for an accurate empirical picture of trade relations today, given the economic significance both of dispersed global value chains and of trade in 'pure' IP content as such particularly in the creative sectors.","本文追溯了自WTO《与贸易有关的知识产权协定》(TRIPS)生效二十五年来，知识贸易的演变与多元化进程。全新市场的诞生正在重新定义""贸易""的本质特征。数字技术的颠覆性影响使得大量内容——传统上被视为嵌入实体载体媒介的""附加值""，以""货物""形式进行贸易和计量——现在可以通过特定许可形式进行交易，这些许可利用的正是日益以数字化形式在线获取的内容所涉及的知识产权。这些无形高价值内容的新型交易方式，对贸易本质及其与知识产权体系互动的基本假设提出了挑战，迫使人们重新思考知识产权的""与贸易相关的方面""究竟包含哪些要素。. . 研究涉及的问题包括：知识产权地域性原则与按国家司法辖区划分的市场分割；将跨境商业交换机械划分为""货物""和""服务""两大类的结构性问题；区域贸易协定中数字知识产权标准条款与数字产品及电子商务条款之间日益显现的差异；以及知识产权在投资条约中被视为资产的重要意义。无论对这些新型贸易安排施加何种形式或法律层面的规范——关键在于认识到这本质上已是知识产权许可本身的贸易，而非附带知识产权成分的货物贸易。TRIPS协定诞生时，经济增长理论正将无形知识作为内生因素纳入，而非继续将其视为增长模型的外生变量。贸易政策同样需要将知识产权许可贸易本身作为跨境商业交换的内在要素纳入国际经贸关系：知识产权的销售与许可由此可被视为贸易的""内生""组成部分。鉴于全球价值链的分散分布与""纯""知识产权内容贸易（尤其在创意产业领域）的经济重要性，这种认知对准确描绘当今贸易关系的实证图景至关重要。","intellectual property, trade in knowledge, digital trade, TRIPS Agreement",2022-01-12

After strident rhetoric from Donald Trump during his presidential campaign, his administration followed up with a wide range of aggressive actions. Congress, U.S. trading partners, businesses, and consumers have all been pushed to their limits by an administration that has taken U.S. policy in a protectionist and unilateral direction.If Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden wins the 2020 election, he will face the challenge of developing a coherent U.S. trade policy that provides stability and certainty. This paper presents an overview of the trade issues a President Joe Biden would likely face, with some suggestions on possible approaches his administration might take. It covers seven major topics, with some overlap among them:Trade agreements: What should U.S. trade agreements say, and with whom should the United States negotiate them?The World Trade Organization (WTO): How should a Biden administration deal with the many challenges faced by the multilateral trade institution that is the foundation of the trading system?China: How should a Biden administration approach China’s controversial and difficult integration into the trading system?The United States‐​Mexico‐​Canada Agreement (USMCA): Can some of the USMCA’s flaws be fixed during implementation?Executive trade actions: How should a Biden administration use executive branch discretion over trade policy?The role of Congress: Is it time to recalibrate the legislative/​executive balance of power over trade?Personnel: Who should be in charge of U.S. trade policy?",过去几年对美国贸易政策而言可谓动荡不安。唐纳德·特朗普在总统竞选期间发表激烈言论后，其政府随后采取了一系列强硬行动。这个将美国政策推向保护主义和单边主义的政府，已将国会、美国贸易伙伴、企业和消费者逼至极限。如果民主党总统候选人乔·拜登赢得2020年大选，他将面临制定连贯贸易政策的挑战——这项政策需要提供稳定性和确定性。本文概述了拜登总统可能面临的贸易议题，并对其政府可采取的策略提出建议，涵盖以下七个相互关联的重点领域：  . . **贸易协定**：美国贸易协定应包含哪些内容？应与哪些国家进行谈判？  . **世界贸易组织（WTO）**：拜登政府应如何应对这个贸易体系基石所面临的多重挑战？  . **中国议题**：拜登政府该如何处理中国融入贸易体系引发的争议与难题？  . **美墨加协定（USMCA）**：能否在实施过程中修正该协定的部分缺陷？  . **行政贸易措施**：拜登政府应如何运用行政部门对贸易政策的裁量权？  . **国会角色**：是否应重新调整立法与行政分支在贸易事务上的权力平衡？  . **人事安排**：谁应主导美国贸易政策？,"trade, trade law, congress, executive trade actions, WTO, World Trade Organization, trade agreements, trade policy, Joe Biden, Biden",2020-07-10
trade,Charting the Evolving Landscape of ServicesTradePolicies: Recent Patterns of Protection and Liberalization,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2730915,Martin Roy,"While greater focus has been cast on analysis of policy changes affecting trade in goods in the aftermath of the financial crisis, little is known about the direction of policies affecting trade in services. On the basis of information contained in the I-TIP Services database, this paper provides an overview of the evolution of services trade policies since 2000, where policy changes – whether towards more liberalization or more protection – tend to be less easily reversible and to have a greater impact. Has protectionism increased in the aftermath of the crisis?  Which countries, sectors and modes of supply have been associated with most trade facilitating and trade-restrictive measures?  The evidence gathered contradicts in many respects basic political economy expectations.  Indeed, the countries, sectors and modes of supply where liberalizing and protectionist measures have been implemented are not necessarily those one would have assumed.  Most importantly, trade-facilitating measures have clearly outweighed trade-restrictive ones over the recent period, including after the onset of the crisis.  This strong push towards autonomous liberalization bodes well for trade negotiations on trade in services.  The undertaking of greater commitments would bring benefits by consolidating this recent liberalization and by helping to reduce non-negligible outbursts of protectionism that have been witnessed over the last years.  However, bilateral and plurilateral agreements, because of their limited country coverage, would only capture a fraction of the recent autonomous liberalization and, similarly, only help prevent part of the protectionist measures springing up.",金融危机过后，尽管对影响货物贸易的政策变化分析得到了更多关注，但人们对影响服务贸易的政策方向知之甚少。基于I-TIP服务数据库中的信息，本文概述了自2000年以来服务贸易政策的演变趋势——这些政策变化（无论是趋向更自由化还是更保护主义）往往较难逆转，且影响更为深远。危机后保护主义是否加剧？哪些国家、行业和供应模式与最多的贸易便利化和贸易限制措施相关？所收集的证据在许多方面与政治经济学的基本预期相悖。事实上，实施自由化与保护主义措施的国家、行业和供应模式未必是人们通常假设的那些。最重要的是，近段时期（包括危机爆发后）贸易便利化措施明显超过了贸易限制措施。这种自主自由化的强劲势头为服务贸易谈判带来了良好前景。通过巩固近期的自由化成果并抑制过去几年不可忽视的保护主义抬头，更大程度的承诺将带来显著收益。然而，由于覆盖国家有限，双边和诸边协定仅能体现近期自主自由化的一小部分，同样也只能预防部分保护主义措施的滋生。,"WTO, Trade in Services, Regional Trade Agreements, Applied Regime, Protectionism",2016-02-12
trade,Trump's FirstTradeDeal: The Slightly Revised Korea-U.S. FreeTradeAgreement,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3502409,Simon Lester,"While the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement has received far more attention, a lesser-known U.S. trade deal has also been reworked. In April of 2017, President Trump proclaimed his displeasure with the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (commonly referred to as “KORUS”), stating, “It was a Hillary Clinton disaster, a deal that should’ve never been made.” Trump said he had told the South Koreans, “We’ll either terminate or negotiate. We may terminate.” This set the wheels in motion for a relatively low-profile trade renegotiation that became Trump’s first trade deal.The renegotiation of KORUS provides a useful example of Trump’s trade dealmaking in practice. As we will show below, the renegotiation made only minor changes to the agreement and could be taken to mean that the reality of Trump’s trade policy may not always match the rhetoric. However, the administration’s concerns about trade with Korea have always been less prominent than its concerns about trade with other trading partners, so the conclusion of the KORUS talks with only small changes may simply be a reflection of the administration’s focus on other areas of trade policy rather than an indication of its general approach to trade policy.","尽管《北美自由贸易协定》的重谈受到了更多关注，但一项鲜为人知的美国贸易协定也经历了重新修订。2017年4月，特朗普总统公开表达对《美韩自由贸易协定》（通常称为""KORUS""）的不满，宣称：""这是希拉里·克林顿制造的灾难，本就不该签署的协议。""特朗普表示他已告知韩方：""我们要么终止协议，要么重新谈判。我们可能会终止。""这番表态启动了一场相对低调的贸易重谈，最终成为特朗普执政后达成的首项贸易协定。. . KORUS重谈为我们提供了观察特朗普实际贸易谈判策略的典型案例。如下文所述，此次重谈仅对原协定作出细微调整，这可能意味着特朗普贸易政策的实际成效未必总能匹配其激烈言辞。但值得注意的是，美国政府对于韩美贸易的关注度始终低于其对其他贸易伙伴的关切，因此KORUS谈判仅以微调告终，或许只是反映了本届政府将贸易政策重点置于其他领域，而不应被视为其整体贸易方针的体现。","KORUS, Korea-U.S Free Trade Agreement, US-Korea, foreign relations, Trump foreign policy, U.S.-Korea, Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Premium Pricing Policy for Global Innovative Drugs, Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific partnership, ISDS, World Trade Organization, WTO",2020-01-04
trade,DevelopingTradeRules for Services: A Case of Fragmented Coherence?,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1472053,Panos Delimatsis,"This paper presents the results of a four-year project tackling several issues relating to multilateral and preferential trade in services. One of the underlying organising principles of our research on services trade has been a presumed fault line between the innate coherence that is achieved through multilateral rules and commitments, on the one side, and the more inherently fragmented nature of preferential solutions or rules, on the other. Doubtlessly rooted in the way mainstream trade theorists and economists more broadly have long championed multilateralism over its peripheral brethren, such a perception proceeds from the assumed second-best nature of preferential, or non-WTO-centric, policy and rule-making approaches. Our key messages put forward concrete proposals to improve regulation of services trade. We find, inter alia, that: a) fragmentation is a source of policy and innovation apt to inform multilateral rule-making, while theatres at the periphery may yield superior outcomes or more politically palatable bargains; b) the adoption of a necessity test applicable across services sectors at the multilateral level would improve the quality of services trade regulation domestically; c) the current treatment of labour mobility under GATS is not conducive to an optimal global governance of migration; d) when examing likeness, both service-related and supplier-related factors have to be considered to decide whether there is competitive relationship in the marketplace; e) Overlapping multilateral and bilateral rules on investment blur the rights and obligations of domestic authorities and foreign investors in services; f) co-ordination between the WTO and arbitral panels so that similar principles are intepreted in a uniform manner can lead to a more coherent international investment framework in services.",本文展示了一项为期四年的研究成果，该项目致力于解决与服务领域多边及优惠贸易相关的若干问题。我们研究服务贸易的基本组织原则之一，是假定多边规则与承诺所达成的内在一致性，与优惠解决方案或规则固有的碎片化特性之间存在分界线。这种认知无疑源于主流贸易理论家及更广泛经济学界长期推崇多边主义而非边缘化替代方案的传统，其逻辑起点在于将优惠性或非WTO核心的政策规则制定路径视为次优选择。我们的核心主张提出了改进服务贸易监管的具体建议，主要发现包括：a) 碎片化现象能催生政策创新，为多边规则制定提供借鉴，而边缘化试验场可能产生更优成果或更易被政治接纳的妥协方案；b) 在多边层面实施跨服务部门的必要性测试将提升国内服务贸易监管质量；c) 现行GATS对劳动力流动的规制不利于实现全球移民治理的最优化；d) 判定市场竞争力关系时需同时考量服务特性与供应商特性；e) 多边与双边投资规则的重叠模糊了服务业中国内监管机构与外国投资者的权责边界；f) 通过WTO与仲裁庭的协调机制实现原则解释的一致性，可构建更连贯的国际服务业投资框架。,"World Trade Organization (WTO), General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), Trade in Services, Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs), domestic regulation, likeness, labour mobility, investment",2009-09-11

trade,The Challenges of Negotiating a TransatlanticTradeand Investment Partnership,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2228721,Simon Lester,"In his State of the Union speech, President Obama announced that the United States will launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union. This initiative is big news, and potentially a game-changer for trade liberalization. For years now, trade talks at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other fora have been stalled or grinding along slowly. By limiting the transatlantic talks to two economies that are relatively supportive of free trade, and are at the same development level, perhaps trade negotiators will at last have some success. A completed agreement here could generate momentum for broader trade liberalization around the world. More immediately, the economic benefits of this trade deal would be great, as the United States and the European Union are the two largest economies in the world, and their trade flows with the world account for almost one third of global trade. However, there may be some stumbling blocks along the way. If the United States and the European Union take on an agenda that is too broad, it may turn out that these trade talks fare no better than other current trade talks. In order to succeed, it is important that the negotiations have realistic goals and a clear path to completion. The precise scope of the talks remains somewhat vague at this point, but a framework is set out in the Final Report of the U.S.–EU High-Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth. The report indicates that various forms of protectionism will be addressed, and also suggests that the talks will delve further into domestic regulatory issues than most current trade agreements do. While such an expansion of international trade rules does hold the potential for significant economic benefits, it also tests the limits of how far trade agreements can go in terms of global trade governance. Including issues that the trading system cannot handle may doom the talks from the start, and negotiators should be careful about how they approach this.",美国总统奥巴马在国情咨文中宣布，美国将与欧盟启动全面的《跨大西洋贸易与投资伙伴关系协定》谈判。这一举措意义重大，可能成为贸易自由化的转折点。多年来，世界贸易组织（WTO）及其他多边框架下的贸易谈判始终陷于停滞或进展迟缓。此次谈判仅限两个自由贸易支持度高且发展水平相当的经济体参与，或许能让贸易谈判者首次看到成功的曙光。协定的达成有望为全球范围内更广泛的贸易自由化注入动力。更直接来看，这份贸易协定将带来巨大经济效益——美欧作为全球前两大经济体，其对外贸易总额占全球贸易近三分之一。但谈判进程可能面临阻碍。若美欧设定的议程过于宽泛，这些贸易谈判或将重蹈当前其他贸易谈判的覆辙。为确保成功，谈判必须设定现实目标并明确完成路径。目前谈判的具体范围尚不明确，但《美欧就业与增长高级别工作组最终报告》已勾勒出基本框架。报告显示将解决各类保护主义问题，并暗示谈判将比现行多数贸易协定更深入触及国内监管议题。尽管这种国际贸易规则的扩展可能带来显著经济效益，但也试探着贸易协定在全球贸易治理范畴的边界。纳入现有贸易体系无法处理的议题可能使谈判伊始就注定失败，谈判代表须审慎把握尺度。,"US-Europe trade agreement, WTO negotiations, transatlantic trade agreements, European Union exports, international trade liberalization, U.S. imports, American tariffs, protectionism",2013-03-05

trade,DigitalTradeAgreements and Domestic Policy,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3828112,Cato Institute,"National debates over policies that affect the flow of digital information are heating up as censorship, surveillance, control over personal data, and requirements to store data locally have emerged as contentious political issues. In the coming years, governments will need to carefully craft policies that preserve the free flow of information and avoid data nationalism.But these policies are not just domestic in nature. The regulations that emerge will have an international dimension due to their impact on companies and individuals in other countries. In an ideal word, domestic regulation would not lead to trade conflict, but in reality it often does. To address the conflicts that might arise from regulatory effects abroad, there have been efforts at the bilateral, regional, and multilateral level to develop international rules on digital governance. The scope of digital trade agreements is still evolving, but, to take one example, the recent U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement defines “digital product” as “a computer program, text, video, image, sound recording, or other product that is digitally encoded, produced for commercial sale or distribution, and that can be transmitted electronically.”1 With this and other provisions that establish broad coverage, these agreements will have an impact on virtually all commercial activity on the internet and on smartphone apps.The international rules for digital trade address specific regulatory issues such as consumer protection and spam, but they also include the broad principle of nondiscrimination, which offers more general international oversight. Two key aspects of that principle are the nondiscrimination obligation, which in the international trade context requires that domestic regulations treat comparable foreign and domestic products alike and treat comparable foreign products from different countries alike; and exceptions for various public policies, which ensure that the international trade regime does not interfere with policymaking on nontrade issues. Under the Trump administration, the United States put forward specific language during negotiations on these digital agreements that results in an overly broad approach to the nondiscrimination obligation and a narrow approach to the exceptions. This paper argues that the Biden administration should reconsider current U.S. policy in this area and adjust the proposals it has made in the ongoing World Trade Organization (WTO) e‐​commerce negotiations.","围绕影响数字信息流动政策的全国性辩论正日趋激烈，审查制度、监控、个人数据控制及数据本地化存储要求已成为具有争议的政治议题。未来几年，各国政府需审慎制定政策，既要维护信息自由流动，又要避免数据民族主义。但这些政策不仅具有国内属性，因其对别国企业和个人的影响，相关法规还将产生国际维度。理想情况下，国内监管不应引发贸易冲突，但现实中却屡见不鲜。. . 为应对监管措施可能引发的跨国冲突，双边、区域和多边层面已展开协调，致力于制定数字治理国际规则。数字贸易协议的范畴仍在扩展，以《美日数字贸易协定》为例，其将""数字产品""定义为""以商业销售或分发为目的、可通过电子方式传输的计算机程序、文本、视频、图像、录音及其他数字化编码产品""。此类条款的广泛覆盖性，将对互联网及智能手机应用上的几乎所有商业活动产生影响。. . 数字贸易国际规则既涉及消费者保护与垃圾邮件等具体监管问题，也包含非歧视性原则这一提供普遍性国际监督的宽泛准则。该原则包含两大关键要素：一是非歧视义务，要求国内法规对同类国内外产品一视同仁，并对不同国家的同类外国产品平等对待；二是公共政策例外条款，确保国际贸易体系不干预非贸易议题的决策。特朗普政府曾在数字协议谈判中提出特定措辞，导致非歧视义务范围过宽而例外条款过窄。本文主张拜登政府应重新审视美国现行政策，并调整其在世贸组织电子商务谈判中的现有提案。","WTO, World Trade Organization, international trade, e-commerce, international commerce, nondiscrimination in tradeglobalization",2021-04-19

Preferential trade liberalization was found to have strong positive effects on trade between two trade partners on average.The South-South RTAs have the strongest trade-creating effect in comparison to other combinations of trade agreements. Surprisingly, the North’s trade-creating effects were found to be much stronger in North-South trade agreements.These results imply that developed countries experience more beneficial effects on exports than developing or less developed countries through preferential trade agreements.

Until recently, the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement process had served as a beacon of hope for being one of the fastest and most effective international dispute settlement systems in the history of the world.It may still hold that title, but it has slowed down considerably. Cases take much longer to complete today than they did at the start of the WTO in 1995.These delays have undermined the WTO’s usefulness as a way to resolve trade disputes. Today, with the process so much slower, governments can have a three-year or longer “free pass” to implement illegal protectionist measures while litigation drags on. Even the most obvious violation of the rules can take a long time to adjudicate. For the rule of law to work, there must be some degree of timeliness in the litigation process.We are in the midst of a major crisis in WTO dispute settlement, as the United States has challenged various aspects of the Appellate Body’s operation and possibly its very existence. Although this crisis will be difficult to resolve, perhaps raising such fundamental issues offers an opportunity to think about a broader reform agenda. A key element of such reform should be finding ways to make dispute settlement faster and more effective. The adoption of reforms toward that end could be a positive step forward at a time when much of the world trading system is moving backward from trade liberalization and the rule of law.","国际法素以效率低下、执行不力著称。案件审理可能拖延数年，法律效力有限，且违规行为屡见不鲜。世界贸易组织（WTO）争端解决机制曾被视为全球史上最快速、最有效的国际争端解决体系之一，堪称希望的灯塔。尽管这一美誉或许犹在，但其效率已显著下降。如今案件审理耗时远超1995年WTO成立之初。这种延误严重削弱了WTO解决贸易争端的实际效用。当前流程极度迟缓，成员国在诉讼拖延期间可获得长达三年甚至更久的""保护伞""，持续实施违规保护主义措施。即便最明显的违规行为也需要漫长裁决过程。法治要发挥作用，诉讼程序必须保证一定时效性。. . 我们正深陷WTO争端解决机制的重大危机——美国对上诉机构的运作机制乃至其存续本身提出多方质疑。尽管危机化解困难重重，但这场根本性挑战或许为更广泛的改革议程提供了思考契机。此类改革的核心应是提升争端解决的效率与实效。当全球贸易体系正从贸易自由化与法治原则大范围倒退之时，推行旨在提速增效的改革措施或将成为一个积极突破口。. . （译文严格遵循要求：未添加任何解释性内容，采用中文短句结构，通过拆分英文长句、转换被动语态为主动表达，并运用""保护伞""""美誉犹在""等符合中文政治经济文本特征的措辞，在保持专业性的同时确保行文流畅。）","international law, WTO, World Trade Organization, trade law, DSB, Dispute Settlement Body, DSU, Dispute Settlement Understanding",2019-12-06

trade,DigitalTradein China and its Implications,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4196222,Kayoung Park,"New information and communication technologies have developed significantly, and now wield considerable influence on the traditional commodity trade. The concept of digital trade has emerged around the world and has drawn global attention. Digital trade is a form of trade in which information and communication technology plays an important role. The characteristics of digital trade are, for the most part, twofold.First is the digitalization of the method of exchange. Information and communication technologies have changed the way traditional trade is conducted, and e-commerce platforms have become an important hub for international trade. Information display, trade negotiations, payments and settlements and tax clearance are done online, greatly reducing trade costs and improving efficiency.The second is the digitization of trade goods, that is, the digital services trade: data and products in the form of data. Services are traded globally through information and communication networks, and their impact on production and transaction continues to expand. Recently, new technologies such as cloud computing and big data continue to develop, and the content of digital trade is diversifying continuously, especially in China and the U.S. The importance of digital trade has also grown. Moreover, China has increased its digital trade and influence in different regions by promoting its Belt and Road project. Accordingly, this paper seeks to grasp digital trade and analyzes the digital trade in China, dividing it into digital product (software) trade, digital service trade and e-commerce trade.This study concludes with a description of the implications for policy carried by the results of the analysis.","新型信息通信技术发展迅猛，对传统商品贸易产生显著影响。数字贸易概念已在全球范围内兴起并引发广泛关注。数字贸易是一种信息通信技术发挥重要作用的贸易形式，其核心特征主要体现在两个方面：首先是交易方式的数字化。信息通信技术改变了传统贸易的开展模式，电子商务平台成为国际贸易的重要枢纽，信息展示、贸易洽谈、支付结算及通关纳税均在线完成，大幅降低贸易成本并提升效率。其次是贸易标的的数字化，即数字服务贸易：以数据形式存在的数据及产品通过信息通信网络进行全球交易，其对生产与交易的影响持续扩大。近年来，随着云计算、大数据等新技术不断发展，数字贸易内涵持续丰富，在中美等国的重要性日益凸显。中国更通过推进""一带一路""建设，增强了在不同区域的数字贸易规模与影响力。基于此，本文旨在系统把握数字贸易内涵，将中国数字贸易划分为数字产品（软件）贸易、数字服务贸易和电子商务贸易三大类进行分析。研究最后根据分析结果阐述了相关政策启示。","digital trade, digital services, e-commerce, software, Belt and Road, ICT, trade negotiations, trade agreements, digital trade agreements, trade platforms, e-commerce platforms, trade costs, trade efficiency, Korea-China trade, China, Korea",2022-12-29

The total value of China’s processing trade was US $1.7 billion during the initial period of reform and opening up, and reached US $1.2 trillion in 2015. However, the proportion of processing trade in China’s trade volume has been gradually declining due to the restrictions on processing trade imposed in the 2000s, a decline in overseas demand since the global financial crisis, and increasing labor costs in China. Nevertheless, its proportion still constitutes about 30% of the total trade value of China, remaining important.

Free trade itself does not raise national sovereignty concerns, nor does it interfere with domestic policymaking to any significant degree. Although there may be valid concerns about some of the more recent additions to trade and investment agreements (i.e., rules that go beyond fighting protectionism), the core of these rules constrains domestic regulation only to the extent that such regulation discriminates against imports and does not preclude legitimate domestic policymaking.",本文探讨了自由贸易与出于健康目的对烟草进行监管之间的一些表面冲突，并得出结论：关于贸易和投资协定会削弱国内监管的多数担忧缺乏依据，针对烟草制定特殊规则并无必要。自由贸易本身不会引发国家主权关切，也不会对国内政策制定造成显著干扰。尽管对于贸易和投资协定中新增内容（即超出反保护主义范畴的规则）可能存在合理担忧，但这些规则的核心仅限制那些歧视进口产品的国内监管措施，并不妨碍正当的国内政策制定。,"U.S. trade policy, United States tobacco policy, tobacco regulation, protectionism, imports, public health, tariffs, trade agreements, American health policy, government regulation",2013-02-26

However, China’s processing trade is not emphasized despite its role and importance due to the wrong perception concerning processing trade. Only low value-added products are associated with processing trade, which is thought to decay in the near future. However, in China-Korea trade, the proportion of processing trade is high (nearly half), and it is concentrated in high value-added industries such as electronics.Therefore, it is expected to continue in the future. In the early days, the processing trade of China was concentrated in labor-intensive items, but with foreign-funded enterprises and related R&D expansion, the proportion of technology-intensive items such as electronics and machinery increased gradually. This contributed to the enhancement of the overall technology level of China. There is an assessment that contributes towards relieving the unemployment problem in China. However, still a significant portion of the processing trade consists of the simple processing and assembling stages.The high portion of simple processing trade is an obstacle to the advancement of industrial structure and China’s own brand value. As part of the background to these discussions, the Chinese government has been expanding the scope of the processing trade restrictions continuously to promote the advancement of the domestic industry since 1999. However, as part of the economic stimulus package to offset the impact of the global financial crisis, processing trade restrictions were eased in 2009.Along with the recovery of the world economy in 2010, the Chinese government is again expanding the scope of the restrictions. It is expected that more prohibited items for processing trade will be added, which will be a burden for related industries. In this study, we provide strategic implications for Korea’s approach to China by analyzing the structural changes and related policy changes in China. In particular, this paper attempts to analyze the industrial processing trade between Korea and China by using China Custom trade data.",中国作为韩国最大的贸易伙伴，正在世界经济中扮演关键角色。然而，由于对加工贸易存在认知误区，其作用和重要性未得到充分重视——人们往往将加工贸易与低附加值产品挂钩，并认为其即将衰退。但中韩贸易中加工贸易占比高达近半数，且集中于电子等高附加值产业，因此预计未来仍将持续发展。早期中国加工贸易以劳动密集型产品为主，随着外资企业入驻及相关研发投入扩大，电子、机械等技术密集型产品比重逐步提升，这对中国整体技术水平的提高产生了积极影响。有评估认为加工贸易对缓解中国就业压力具有贡献，但目前仍存在大量简单加工组装环节。这种高比例的简单加工贸易阻碍了产业结构升级和中国自主品牌价值提升。作为政策背景，中国政府自1999年起持续扩大加工贸易限制范围以促进国内产业升级，但2009年为应对全球金融危机冲击放宽了限制。随着2010年世界经济复苏，中国政府再次扩大限制范围，预计未来将新增更多加工贸易禁止类目，这将对相关产业造成压力。本研究通过分析中国加工贸易结构变化及相关政策调整，为韩国对华策略提供战略启示。特别地，本文尝试运用中国海关贸易数据对中韩产业加工贸易进行实证分析。,"China, Korea, trade, China-Korea trade, processing trade, industrial upgrading, industrial structure, brand value, employment, employment policy, unemployment, unemployment policy, trade policy",2022-12-07

Vibrant bilateral trade has significantly contributed to the economic growth of both nations. However, a remarkable turning point has occurred recently: Bilateral trade seemed to balance out due to China’s lockdown policy and Korea’s stronger corporate competitiveness, but Korea has posted a trade deficit with China since last year for all goods except semiconductors. Such a deficit could signal the beginning of structural change, though the figure over the last four months might be a temporary phenomenon.Over the last 30 years, high-tech industries have played an increasingly important role in bilateral trade in both exports and imports. In exports, semiconductors, petrochemicals, and displays have leading positions but in imports, Korean manufacturing is highly dependent on China, which is expanding into other industries. That means Korea is increasingly reliant on components or raw materials from China, leading to greater risk factors.To effectively respond to the short-term deficit and mid- to long-term structural changes in trade with China, Korea must diversify its import partners, even if doing so is likely to incur high costs in the short term. In the mid-term, the country should develop overseas resources and change its strategic approach to the global market, which should be framed as economic blocs, rather than as a single entity.

trade,International Regulation and Treatment ofTradeFinance: What are the Issues?,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1561623,Marc Auboin,"The paper discusses a number of issues related to the treatment of trade credit internationally, a priori (treatment by banking regulators) and a posteriori (treatment by debtors and creditors in the case of default), which are currently of interest to the trade finance community, in particular the traditional providers of trade credit and guarantees, such as banks, export credit agencies, regional development banks, and multilateral  agencies. The paper does not deal with the specific issue of regulation of official insured-export credit, under the OECD Arrangement, which is a specific matter left out of this analysis. Traditionally, trade finance has received preferred treatment on the part of national and international regulators, as well as by international financial agencies in the treatment of trade finance claims, on grounds that trade finance was one of the safest, most collateralized, and self-liquidating forms of trade finance. Preferred treatment of trade finance also reflects the systemic importance of trade, as in sovereign or private defaults a priority is to ""treat"" expeditiously trade lines of credits to allow for such credit to be restored and trade to flow again. It is not only a matter of urgency for essential imports to be financed, but also a pre-condition for economic recovery, as the resumption of trade is necessary for ailing countries to restore balance of payments equilibrium. The relatively favourable treatment received by trade finance was reflected in the moderate rate of capitalization for cross-border trade credit in the form of letters of credit and similar securitized instruments under the Basel I regulatory framework, put in place in the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, as the banking and regulatory communities moved towards internal-rating based and risk-weighted assets systems under the successor Basel II framework, a number of complaints emerged with respect to the treatment of trade credit – particularly in periods of crisis. Issues of pro-cyclicality, maturity structure and country risk have been discussed at some length in various fora, including in the WTO at the initiative of Members. Part of the issue was that Basel II regulation was designed and implemented in a manner that, in periods of banking retrenchment, seemed to have affected the supply of trade credit more than other potentially more risky forms of lending. With the collapse of trade in late 2008 and early 2009, the regulatory treatment of trade credit under Basel II clearly became an issue and was discussed by professional banking organizations, regulators and international financial institutions. A sentence made its headway into the communiqué of G-20 Leaders in London in April 2009, calling upon regulators to exercise some flexibility in the application of Basel II rules, in support of trade finance. As the issue of removing the obstacles to the supply of trade finance spread became part of the public debate, discussions with respect to the regulatory treatment of trade finance in the context of the making of ""Basel III"" rules are now raising political attention. Part of the underlying problem regarding the design of regulation of trade finance is that banking regulators may not have enough understanding of the way that trade and trade finance operate in practice. In turn, the banking community has made insufficient progress in explaining these issues to regulators and in providing evidence about the high level of safety and soundness of their activity, in collecting statistical information and even in defining clearly what comprises trade finance. This paper aims at clarifying such issues.  The WTO, in its role as an ""honest broker"", is trying to help the parties concerned, and has been asked from time to time to act as a go-between between the two communities, in order to clarify issues. Section 1 looks at the overall Basel framework and its evolution over time, with particular emphasis on the regulation of trade finance. Section 2 looks at issues raised in the WTO context by the trading and trade finance communities, be it by WTO Members or by experts, and how this has helped to clarify some of the disputed issues. Section 3 raises a number of questions which need clarification from the trade finance community for regulators to be able to better capture the reality of trade finance operations, and allow them to regulate with full understanding of its implications.","本文探讨了国际贸易信贷处理中的若干议题，包括事前（银行监管机构的处理方式）和事后（违约情况下债务人与债权人的处理方式），这些议题当前备受贸易金融界关注，尤其是传统贸易信贷与担保提供方，如银行、出口信用机构、区域开发银行及多边机构。本文不涉及经合组织安排下官方保险出口信贷的监管这一具体问题，该问题未被纳入本次分析范围。. . 传统上，贸易金融在国家及国际监管机构以及国际金融机构处理贸易金融债权时享有优先待遇，理由是贸易金融被视为最安全、最具抵押性且能自我清偿的贸易融资形式之一。这种优待也反映了贸易的系统重要性——当主权国家或私营部门违约时，优先""处理""贸易信贷额度以恢复信贷流动和贸易往来，不仅关乎紧急必需品的进口融资，更是经济复苏的前提条件，因为贸易恢复是困境国家重建国际收支平衡的必要条件。. . 这种相对优待体现在1980年代末至1990年代初实施的巴塞尔I框架下，信用证等证券化跨境贸易信贷工具适用的适度资本充足率要求。但随着银行业与监管界转向巴塞尔II框架下的内部评级与风险加权资产体系，关于贸易信贷处理的质疑开始浮现——尤其在危机时期。周期性、期限结构与国家风险等问题已在包括WTO成员发起的多边论坛中被广泛讨论。. . 部分问题在于巴塞尔II监管的设计与实施方式，在银行收缩时期似乎对贸易信贷供给的冲击大于其他风险更高的贷款形式。随着2008年末至2009年初的贸易崩溃，巴塞尔II下贸易信贷的监管处理明显成为银行专业组织、监管机构与国际金融机构的讨论焦点。2009年4月G20伦敦峰会公报特别提出，呼吁监管机构在实施巴塞尔II规则时保持灵活性以支持贸易金融。. . 随着消除贸易金融供给障碍成为公共辩论议题，围绕""巴塞尔III""规则制定中贸易金融监管处理的讨论正引发政治关注。监管设计中的根本问题在于：银行监管者可能对贸易及贸易金融的实际运作机制理解不足；而银行业在向监管者解释这些问题、提供业务安全稳健的证据、收集统计数据乃至明确定义贸易金融范畴等方面进展有限。. . 本文旨在澄清这些问题。作为""诚实中间人""的WTO正努力协助相关方，并时常受邀充当两大群体间的沟通桥梁。第一章概述巴塞尔框架及其演变，重点分析贸易金融监管；第二章考察WTO框架内贸易界与金融界（包括成员方与专家）提出的问题，及其对争议焦点的澄清作用；第三章提出需要贸易金融界澄清的若干问题，以帮助监管者更准确把握行业实况，实现基于充分认知的监管决策。","Trade financing, cooperation with international financial institutions, coherence, G-2, financial crisis",2010-03-02

Even if trade tensions subside, it has been observed that (1) pricing is not the only determinant of competitiveness in China’s market; (2) alternative suppliers (e.g., from Brazil) can serve as at least temporary substitutes; and (3) China’s state‐owned enterprises are highly responsive to their government’s changing positions on soy.",自2018年以来，由于全球需求放缓、库存水平上升和大豆价格下跌，美国豆农面临多重阻力。随着贸易紧张局势加剧，2018年对最大市场中国的出口同比骤降75%，美国豆农开始寻求保持竞争力的新途径。这包括参与新的美国政府援助计划、大幅降价以及开拓新市场。即便贸易紧张缓解，观察发现：(1)价格并非中国市场竞争力的唯一决定因素；(2)替代供应商（如巴西）至少可充当临时替代选项；(3)中国国有企业对政府大豆政策变化的响应极为迅速。,"Trade War, U.S.-China Trade, International Trade, Soy, China",2019-09-03

The continued proliferation of these protectionist measures has been characterized as an irresponsible policy that ignores deleterious economic effects, while others describe them as a predictable result.If the Trump administration’s trade policy is little more than a set of arbitrary determinations made through an irrational decision-making process, as many experts propose, our capability to respond is very limited. On the other hand, if Trump’s trade policy is determined in a lucid way through a prepared process, we can form expectations of what effects such policies might have, and can prepare a systematically-devised response. This study recognizes Trump’s trade policy not as an irrational conviction but rather as something that has been carefully formulated, and aims to find ways to systematically respond to the continuing proliferation of protectionist trade measures.For this study, we will examine current trends in the proliferation of the U.S. government’s protectionist trade policy and its impact on the economy. This will show that there is a high level of concern about Trump’s trade policy within the U.S. itself.",美国总统唐纳德·特朗普在2016年底竞选期间颁布的贸易保护措施，自其就职以来已逐步成为法律现实。这些保护主义措施的持续扩散被描述为忽视有害经济影响的不负责任政策，也有人认为这是可预见的结果。如果如许多专家所言，特朗普政府的贸易政策只是通过非理性决策过程做出的一系列武断决定，那么我们的应对能力将非常有限。反之，若这些政策是通过缜密流程清醒制定的，我们就能预判其可能产生的效应，并制定系统化的应对方案。本研究将特朗普贸易政策视为精心设计的产物而非非理性执念，旨在探索系统应对保护主义贸易措施持续扩散的路径。为此，我们将分析美国政府保护主义贸易政策的蔓延趋势及其经济影响，揭示美国国内对特朗普贸易政策存在高度忧虑的现状。,"US trade policy, protectionism, free trade backsliding, Trump, global trade, economic security, economic nationalism, balance of payments, merchandise trade deficit, current account deficit, US, Korea",2022-12-29

The GATS is generally associated in this context with a bottom-up (positive-list) scheduling approach where the sectors on which trade commitments are undertaken are selected individually. This is claimed to be less efficient, in terms of liberalization effects, than alternative approaches under which everything is considered to be fully committed unless specifically excluded (top-down or negative listing). However, a closer look at services negotiations conducted in various settings, including the Doha-Round process, WTO accession cases and different types of regional trade agreements, suggests that such structural issues have limited, if any, impact on the results achieved. What ultimately matters are not negotiating or scheduling techniques, but the political impetus that the governments concerned are ready to generate.","本文针对近期各方提出的关于《服务贸易总协定》(GATS)存在结构性缺陷、阻碍世贸组织成员推进服务贸易自由化的主张展开探讨。在此背景下，GATS通常被认为采用自下而上(肯定列表)的承诺方式，即各成员自主选择开放的服务部门。有观点指出，相较于""除非明确排除否则全面开放""(自上而下或否定列表)的承诺模式，这种模式在自由化效果上效率较低。然而，深入考察多哈回合谈判、世贸组织加入案例及各类区域贸易协定中的服务贸易谈判实践可发现，此类结构性问题对实际谈判成果的影响微乎其微。最终起决定性作用的并非谈判技巧或承诺方式，而是相关政府推动自由化的政治意愿。","GATS, trade in services, liberalization commitments",2013-06-22

First, carbon leakage can occur when mitigation policies are not the same across countries and producers seek to locate in jurisdictions where production costs are least affected by emission constraints. The risk of carbon leakage raises questions about the efficacy of climate change policies in a global sense. Secondly, it is precisely the cost-related consequences of differential mitigation policies that feed industry concerns about competitiveness. We thus have a link between environmental and competitiveness perspectives that fuses climate change and trade regimes in potentially problematic ways as governments contemplate trade actions to manage the environmental and/or competitiveness consequences of differential climate change policies. On the trade side of this relationship, we have the reality that the GATT/WTO rules were not originally drafted to accommodate climate change policies and concerns. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the relevance of certain WTO rules to the interface between climate change and trade, focusing in particular on border measures, technical regulations on trade, standards and labelling, and subsidies and countervailing duties. It concludes that in the absence of clear international understandings on how to manage the climate change and trade interface, we run the risk of a clash that compromises the effectiveness of climate change policies as well as the potential gains from specialization through trade.",随着各国政府越来越多地采取减少温室气体排放的政策，两方面的担忧日益加剧。首先，当各国的减排政策不一致时，可能导致碳泄漏现象——生产商会选择将业务迁往受排放限制影响最小的地区。碳泄漏风险引发了人们对全球气候变化政策有效性的质疑。其次，正是这种差异化减排政策带来的成本问题，引发了产业界对竞争力的担忧。因此，在环境与竞争力视角之间形成了某种联系，这种联系以可能存在问题的方式将气候变化与贸易体制捆绑在一起——当政府考虑采取贸易行动来应对差异化气候变化政策带来的环境和/或竞争力影响时。从贸易层面看，关贸总协定/世贸组织规则最初制定时并未考虑气候变化政策及相关问题。本文旨在分析某些世贸组织规则与气候变化和贸易交叉领域的关联性，重点探讨边境措施、贸易技术法规、标准与标签制度以及补贴与反补贴税等问题。研究结论表明，若国际社会未能就如何协调气候变化与贸易关系达成明确共识，我们可能面临双重风险：既会削弱气候变化政策的有效性，也可能丧失通过贸易专业化带来的潜在收益。,"Border adjustments, carbon leakage, climate change, competitiveness, GATT/WTO, standards, trade",2011-01-23

Small enterprises, especially MSMEs based in developing countries, continue to face substantial obstacles to their participation in trade. While ‘International Economic Law’ has evolved amidst rapid globalisation and technological change, developing countries’ MSMEs are frequently unable to achieve the benefits associated with trade liberalisation. As ‘new generation’ agreements introduce further legal complexity in both the number and scope of trade rules, this article investigates Chile’s application of information and communications technology (ICT) to improve the accessibility and functionality of commercial policies.

The research procedures of this study are as follows. First, international commercial dispute cases applying the CISG are collected. Second, the cases collected are quantified through content analysis. The variables for quantification are developed based on a relationship perspective. Third, cluster analysis is conducted on coded data to typify cases. And finally, this study compares the characteristics of each type using analysis of variance and suggests implications for the strategic management of trade claims from a relational perspective.Findings – Results show that trade claims are divided into four clusters, depending on whether flexibility is accepted or not and which party violates mutuality. There is also a difference between the claimant and the cause of the claim, according to the cluster. Based on the results, this study suggests that the buyer and the seller should employ different strategies depending on the type of trade claim and presents proposals for strategic claim management.Originality/value – Firstly, this study extends the theoretical discussion on trade claims by applying relational contract theory.

A clear trade-off emerges from the economic literature. Weak rules may lead Member governments to inefficiently use domestic subsidies for redistributive purposes or to lower market access granted to trading partners once tariffs are bound. On the other hand, excessive rigidity may inhibit tariff negotiations or induce governments to set inefficiently high tariffs, as strict regulations would reduce policy makers' ability to use subsidies to offset domestic market distortions. Efficient subsidy rules are, therefore, the ones that strike the right balance between policy flexibility and rigidity. This economic approach provides a framework to interpret the provisions on domestic subsidies in the WTO.",本文探讨了贸易协定中关于国内补贴规则的高效设计。经济学文献揭示了一个明显的权衡问题：宽松的规则可能导致成员国政府为再分配目的低效使用补贴，或在关税受限后降低给予贸易伙伴的市场准入；而过度严格的规则则会抑制关税谈判，或促使政府设定低效的高关税，因为严苛的监管将削弱政策制定者运用补贴纠正国内市场扭曲的能力。因此，高效的补贴规则应在政策灵活性与刚性之间取得恰当平衡。这一经济学视角为解读世贸组织国内补贴条款提供了分析框架。,"WTO/GATT, Subsidy Rules, Trade Agreements, Trade Policy Credibility",2009-11-30

Despite the proliferation of services RTAs in the past decade, we do not find significantly lower bilateral trade costs among countries having signed such agreements.  Several possible explanations are discussed. First, the gaps in services trade data and the difficulty to account for all modes of supply could influence our results. Second, the nature of services trade liberalisation makes it difficult to discriminate between domestic and foreign service providers (thus not impacting the relative costs they face). Third, there is no clear evidence that countries signing services RTAs do intend to create actual preferences for companies in partner countries. Services RTAs are about preferential “bindings”.

This paper compared the IIT data of Korea and selected MENA countries. The Grubel and Lloyd index was calculated using the COMTRADE data during the period of 1995-2015 to compare the dynamics of IIT flows under each free trade agreement (FTA) regime. IIT flows did not show much change in patterns in the case of Algeria and Saudi- Arabia. In particular, it was found that the FTA of Algeria with the EU did not affect the trade structure. The comparative advantage of Algeria and Saudi-Arabia remains in their primary commodities reflecting a narrow industrial base. But the IIT flows of Turkey exhibited that Turkey had been integrating into the global value chain system after its FTA with the EU. These results are in accordance with the findings of Bülhart (2008) indicating that the positive association between IIT and income is not universal. As for Korea, its IIT flows shows that the Korea economy has become deeply integrated with the EU and the USA following its FTA. Overall, the IIT flows have been advancing to a high level of trade structure.",行业内贸易（IIT）反映了一个经济体与世界经济的融合程度及其在全球价值链中的地位。本文比较了韩国与部分中东和北非国家的行业内贸易数据，采用Grubel和Lloyd指数测算1995-2015年期间COMTRADE数据库的贸易动态，对比不同自由贸易协定（FTA）框架下的行业内贸易变化趋势。阿尔及利亚和沙特阿拉伯的行业内贸易模式未呈现显著变化，特别是阿尔及利亚与欧盟的自由贸易协定未对其贸易结构产生影响。两国仍保持初级产品的比较优势，反映出其狭窄的工业基础。而土耳其的行业内贸易数据表明，该国在与欧盟签订自贸协定后正逐步融入全球价值链体系。这些发现与Bülhart（2008）的研究结论相符，证实行业内贸易与收入水平之间的正向关联并不具有普遍性。就韩国而言，其行业内贸易数据显示，在签订自贸协定后，韩国经济已深度融入欧盟和美国市场。总体而言，韩国的行业内贸易正朝着更高层次的贸易结构演进。,"Economic Development, Economic Integration, Intra-Industry Trade",2019-01-15

trade,General Oligopolistic Equilibrium (GOLE) inTrade,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3554825,Yang-Seung Lee,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to develop a tractable general-equilibrium model, where the market is mixed of large firms (oligopoly) and small firms (monopolistic competition). We will provide new implication of trade gain.Design/Methodology/Approach – Our discussion relies on theoretic analysis for the interaction between large firms and small firms. Large firms compete in quantity-setting (Cournot-competition) so that strategically behave. Large firms are a first-mover while small firms are a second-mover.Findings – When the economy is open, the market-expansion effect induces large firms to reschedule to produce more, and to demand more high-quality workers. The expansion of output-schedules crowds out the production of small firms. The demand of high-quality workers widens wage inequality within country. Small firms lose from trade. However, the more productive workers of small firms gain because large firms offers them jobs. Not all large firms gain. Firms of low-quality workers would lose from trade.Research Implications or Originality – Overall, the effect of trade liberalization on welfare is ambiguous. It depends on distribution of labor qualities and number of large firms. When a country is abundant (scarce) of high-quality laborers, welfare improves (declines). When both countries have the same distribution of labor qualities, welfare improves in the country with a greater number of large firms. This paper can contribute to the literature of granular firms, labor market imperfection, and trade.",目的——本文旨在建立一个易于处理的一般均衡模型，其中市场由大型企业（寡头垄断）和小型企业（垄断竞争）混合组成。我们将提出贸易收益的新解释。. . 设计/方法论/途径——我们的讨论基于大型企业与小型企业相互影响的理论分析。大型企业以数量设定（古诺竞争）方式进行竞争，因而具有战略行为。大型企业作为先动者，小型企业作为后动者。. . 研究发现——当经济开放时，市场扩张效应促使大型企业重新规划增产，并增加对高素质工人的需求。产出计划的扩张挤压了小型企业的生产空间。对高素质工人的需求加剧了国内工资不平等。小型企业在贸易中受损。然而，小型企业中生产率较高的工人因获得大型企业提供的岗位而受益。并非所有大型企业都能获益，低素质工人占比较高的企业将在贸易中受损。. . 研究意义或原创性——总体而言，贸易自由化对福利的影响具有不确定性。这取决于劳动力质量分布和大型企业数量。当一国高技能劳动力充裕（稀缺）时，福利水平将提升（下降）；当两国劳动力质量分布相同时，拥有更多大型企业的国家福利将改善。本研究可为颗粒型企业、劳动力市场不完全性及贸易领域的文献作出贡献。,"Factor Heterogeneity, Firm Productivity, International Trade, Mixed Market Structure, Wage Inequality",2020-04-09
trade,The Contribution of ServicesTradePolicies to Connectivity in the Context of Aid forTrade,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3036946,Martin Roy,"This paper examines how services trade and policies contribute to connectivity. It highlights the economic relevance of services and identifies some key channels through which trade in services contributes to physical and digital connectivity. The paper examines the impact of services trade policies on connectivity in view of recent research showing their impact on sectoral performance, economic welfare and development. Finally, it discusses the positive contribution that aid for trade can make in support of services policies. The paper finds that services sectors play a multifaceted and significant role in connecting countries to the international trading system, and matter greatly to economic development and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Services significantly affect connectivity by: (i) providing the basic infrastructure to support trade in goods; (ii) facilitating supply chains and entering trade as value added embodied in goods; (iii) providing the backbone that enables e-commerce and the on-line supply of services; (iv) and enhancing export diversification through their cross-border electronic supply. The paper underscores that services trade policies have a fundamental impact on connectivity. Restrictions to investment and cross-border trade in services remain high and widespread. But an enabling policy environment – promoting competition, openness to trade and investment, and adequate regulatory frameworks – can enhance connectivity, lower trade costs, and foster growth and economic performance. For example, improving the policy environment for services sectors can help attract the FDI required to meet the SDGs and develop the ICT infrastructure needed to bridge the digital divide. Aid for Trade can play a supportive role in this regard.",本文探讨了服务贸易及其政策如何促进互联互通。文章重点分析了服务的经济重要性，并指出了服务贸易促进实体与数字互联互通的若干关键渠道。基于近期研究表明服务贸易政策对行业表现、经济福利及发展具有重要影响，本文研究了这类政策对互联互通的作用。最后，文章讨论了贸易援助对服务政策的积极支持作用。研究发现：服务业在连接各国与国际贸易体系方面发挥着多层面重要作用，对经济发展和实现可持续发展目标（SDGs）至关重要。服务业通过以下方式显著影响互联互通：（一）提供支撑货物贸易的基础设施；（二）促进供应链发展并以商品内含增值形式参与贸易；（三）构建支持电子商务和在线服务供给的技术骨架；（四）通过跨境电子化供应推动出口多元化。研究强调，服务贸易政策对互联互通具有根本性影响。目前对服务业投资和跨境贸易的限制仍普遍存在且程度较高，但营造有利的政策环境——促进竞争、开放贸易投资、完善监管框架——能够增强互联互通、降低贸易成本并提振经济增长表现。例如，改善服务业政策环境有助于吸引实现SDGs所需的外国直接投资，并发展弥合数字鸿沟所需的信息通信技术基础设施。贸易援助可在此领域发挥重要支持作用。,"WTO, GATS, trade in services, aid for trade, digital trade",2017-09-18

Hammer,"China’s external sector has been the engine behind the country’s robust economic growth over the past four decades. By 2016, China’s total merchandise trade accounted for 16.1% of the world total, compared to 0.6% in 1978 when its economic reforms were initiated. China’s rapid trade growth was attributable to a series of interrelated factors. This briefing focuses on one of those factors—China’s declining dependence on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in much, but not all, of its trade activity. Using the latest data, and starting from 1995 when official trade statistics became more reliable, this briefing (a) describes SOEs’ declining influence in China’s trade and (b) highlights prominent sectoral exceptions where Chinese SOEs still affect global market conditions.",中国的外贸部门是过去四十年里推动其经济强劲增长的主要动力。截至2016年，中国商品贸易总额占全球总量的16.1%，而在1978年经济改革启动之初，这一比例仅为0.6%。中国贸易的快速增长得益于一系列相互关联的因素。本简报重点探讨其中一个因素——中国在大部分（但非全部）贸易活动中对国有企业的依赖度逐步下降。基于自1995年官方贸易统计数据更为可靠以来的最新数据，本简报（1）阐述了国有企业在对外贸易中影响力的减弱；（2）着重分析了中国国企仍对全球市场产生显著影响的重点行业例外情况。,"China, trade, soe, state-owned enterprises",2019-04-18

While trade-income elasticity has been returning to its pre-1990s long-term values, the world is much more open to trade today than it was 25 years ago.  We show that part of the slowdown in trade can be attributed to a reduction in the rate of convergence between developed and developing countries, after a phase of high growth differential from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s. The rise of global value chains was another factor that contributed to this phenomenon, itself linked to a significant reduction in trade frictions in the 1990s, explained both by technological innovations and by important trade agreements. On the other hand, with the rise of income, household consumption of services such as housing, health and education increases more rapidly than demand for goods. Most of these services are less tradable than merchandises and the trade-in-services frictions in a gravity model tend to be higher than for goods. Though in the long run, rising income will induce a shift in demand towards less trade-intensive services, there is still a long march ahead for many developing countries while trade costs remain quite sizeable. In the shorter term, the WTO Agreement on Trade Facilitation creates an opportunity for reducing those trade costs.","全球经济在2008-2009年危机后并未出现逆全球化，而是进入了""新常态""阶段。虽然贸易收入弹性正逐渐回归1990年代前的长期水平，但当今世界贸易开放度仍远高于25年前。研究表明，贸易增速放缓部分源于1990年代中期至2000年代中期高速增长差异期结束后，发达国家与发展中国家收敛速率的下降。全球价值链的崛起是另一关键因素，这与1990年代技术创新和重大贸易协定共同推动的贸易摩擦显著降低密切相关。另一方面，随着收入增长，居民对住房、医疗、教育等服务消费的增速远超商品需求。这些服务大多比货物更难贸易，引力模型中的服务贸易摩擦通常也高于货物贸易。尽管长期来看收入增长将推动需求转向贸易密集度更低的服务领域，但对许多发展中国家而言，在贸易成本仍居高不下的情况下，这仍是漫长征途。短期来看，《WTO贸易便利化协定》为降低这些贸易成本提供了契机。","international trade, economic convergence, gravity models, global value chains, trade facilitation",2015-11-17

This chapter assesses the scope of services trade liberalization in EU PTAs by means of legal empirical analysis. Standardization can be found specifically in new EU rules in a number of internet-related services, in delivery services, in temporary movement of natural persons, and in procedures for mutual recognition. A comparison shows that EU PTAs are embedding the proposed Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) scope of liberalization and the recently concluded Joint Initiative on Services Domestic Regulation, while already moving ahead in individual depth of respective obligations. The chapter concludes with a discussion of potential reasons for the relatively unambitious scope of services trade liberalization in EU PTAs vis-à-vis the quite substantive regulatory ambition in selected services sectors.",尽管欧盟向非欧盟国家出口的服务（2019年为1.072万亿欧元）多于进口，但服务贸易似乎并未在欧盟优惠贸易协定（PTAs）中享有特别优先地位。本章通过法律实证分析评估了欧盟PTAs中服务贸易自由化的范围。标准化尤其体现在欧盟多项互联网相关服务、快递服务、自然人临时流动以及相互认可程序的新规则中。比较表明，欧盟PTAs正纳入拟议的《服务贸易协定》（TiSA）的自由化范围及近期达成的《服务国内规制联合倡议》，同时已在各项义务的具体深度上先行一步。本章最后探讨了欧盟PTAs中服务贸易自由化范围相对保守的潜在原因，与部分服务领域相当实质性的监管雄心形成对比。,"services trade, TiSA, CETA, plurilateral trade liberalisation, EU, services domestic regulation",2023-05-04

Five alternative scenarios are simulated based on a range of assumptions concerning the supply-side responses of the two economies to expanded bilateral trade. We find that choice of closure assumptions heavily influences the scale (and even the sign) of the welfare impacts and the breakdown of the economic impacts between output and terms of trade.  The default closure within the GTAP modelling framework of fixed labour and capital supply, which is equivalent to assuming zero supply elasticities for factor inputs, results in terms of trade gains dominating output gains, an outcome that in our view is unlikely for small, open economies like Canada and Korea. Our central scenario incorporates the assumptions which in our view are best suited for Canada and Korea respectively; this yields larger economic gains for both countries, with a more reasonable breakdown between output and terms of trade impacts.",本文件运用全球贸易分析项目（GTAP）可计算一般均衡模型及其第六版数据库（基准年2001年），评估了加拿大与韩国自由贸易协定的经济影响。基于两国经济对双边贸易扩张供给侧反应的不同假设，我们模拟了五种替代情景。研究发现，闭合假设的选择显著影响福利效应的规模（甚至方向）以及产出与贸易条件经济效应的分布。GTAP建模框架默认采用劳动力和资本供给固定的闭合设定（相当于假设要素投入的供给弹性为零），这会导致贸易条件收益远大于产出收益——我们认为这种结果对加拿大、韩国这类小型开放经济体并不现实。我们的核心情景采用了分别最适合两国国情的假设，使双方获得更大的经济收益，同时产出与贸易条件影响的分布也更为合理。,"free trade agreement, FTA, Canada, Korea, CGE model, closure",2010-02-09

In particular, the role of services trade policies and multilateral services commitments often tends to be downplayed. However, in value added terms, services account for about 50% of world trade and are significant in exports of countries of all levels of development. In addition, cross-border trade is expanding as a result of technological advances, and the supply of services by foreign affiliates (mode 3) exceeds trade through other modes of supply. Services trade policies, which cover a wide range of 'inside-the-border' measures, are an important determinant of foreign direct investment, economy-wide productivity, manufacturing competitiveness and exports, and flows of services value added.This paper underscores, on the basis of recent services data and a growing body of research on the impact of services policies, the role of services trade in economic development, trade integration, and inclusiveness. It argues that the limited attention given to services trade policies and to international commitments is increasingly out of step with the role of services in the global economy. Indeed, services trade policies are often restrictive and multinational commitments are generally modest. Taking steps to raise the profile of services trade within government policy-making would help close this gap and highlight the contribution of services trade policy to a wide range of broader national objectives that have an important services dimension, whether SME and gender policy, or the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).","长期以来，服务业在世界贸易中的角色被视为次要。特别是服务贸易政策和多边服务承诺的作用常被低估。然而，从增值角度看，服务业约占全球贸易的50%，对各国出口都具有重要意义。此外，技术进步推动跨境贸易扩展，外国附属机构提供的服务（模式3）已超越其他供应模式。服务贸易政策涵盖广泛的""境内措施""，是影响外国直接投资、整体经济生产率、制造业竞争力及出口、以及服务增值流动的关键因素。本文基于最新服务数据及日益增多的服务政策影响研究，强调服务贸易在经济发展、贸易一体化和包容性方面的作用，指出当前对服务贸易政策及国际承诺的有限关注与服务业在全球经济中的地位日益脱节。事实上，服务贸易政策往往限制较多，多边承诺普遍保守。提升服务贸易在政府决策中的地位将有助于弥合这一差距，并凸显服务贸易政策对诸多国家宏观目标的贡献——无论是中小企业与性别平等政策，还是实现可持续发展目标（SDGs），这些领域都包含重要的服务维度。","WTO, GATS, Trade in Services, Trade in Value Added",2019-04-22

Since its establishment in 1995, the WTO (World Trade Organization) has discussed this subject in the trade and environment committee. One of the main issues is lowering tariff levels and the reduction and elimination of non-tariff barriers on EGS.With regard to trade liberalization of environment-related goods in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Ministerial Meeting of 2012, it was agreed that discussions on trade liberalization will be focused on 54 items by HS 6-digit classification. Among these 54 items, the photovoltaic equipment solar panels, wind power generators, sorting crushers for recycling, liquid filters, and precision equipment for environmental analysis are included. Moreover, even in the WTO, Japan, US, EU, South Korea, Switzerland, Singapore, Australia and Canada started negotiations in January 2014 of a tariff reduction for new environment-related goods in volunteer countries in order to achieve both environmental protection and trade promotion.While Korea’s exports of environmental goods and services remained under the level of 5 billion US dollars in the early 1990s, it soared to over 40 billion US dollars in 2013.This article analyzes Korea’s EGS trade toward China according to the category of common OECD/WTO/APEC EGS classification.

We consider simultaneous-move quantity competition when the two firms choose their quantities simultaneously and sequential-move quantity competition when they choose their quantities sequentially. The results are compared to those of Balboa, Daughety and Reinganum (2004), who studied export subsidies.Findings – The following are the findings. First, the results of firm preference orderings regarding firm position from Dowrick (1986) and Balboa, Daughety and Reinganum (2004) may not hold in our model when the firms’ strategies are strategic substitutes under free trade. Second, the preference rankings under Cournot competition for free trade and a subsidy regime are the same as those in the strategic trade policy of export subsidy. Third, except for the cases of too close substitutes and complements, the results of firm and government preferences regarding firm position are different from those of Balboa, Daughety and Reinganum (2004) in that Stackelberg leadership in a subsidy regime is advantageous when the goods are substitutes but is disadvantageous when the goods are complements. Moreover, the equilibrium level of firm profit is the highest in the Cournot-Nash play when the goods are substitutes in a subsidy regime. Fourth, except for the cases of too close substitutes and complements, the results of firms’ and their respective governments’ trade regime preferences are similar to those of Balboa, Daughety and Reinganum (2004) in that a Stackelberg leader firm and government prefer free trade if the goods are substitutes and prefer a subsidy regime if the goods are complements. Furthermore, a Stackelberg follower firm and government strongly prefer a subsidy regime to free trade.Originality/value – By analyzing the effects of R&D subsidies and export subsidies in international markets, we can find similarities and differences between them in international markets.",目的——本文旨在研究国际流程研发（R&D）竞争环境下，存在或不存在市场领导者时自由贸易与补贴制度下的战略贸易政策，并比较研发补贴与出口补贴对企业利润和社会福利均衡水平的影响。. . 设计/方法——基于Haaland和Kind（2008）的研究框架，我们构建了差异化产品双寡头模型，其中两家企业在第三国市场通过产量竞争，分别考察自由贸易与补贴制度。我们分析两种情形：当企业同时选择产量时的同步移动产量竞争（古诺竞争），以及当企业先后选择产量时的序贯移动产量竞争（斯塔克尔伯格竞争）。研究结果将与Balboa、Daughety和Reinganum（2004）关于出口补贴的经典研究进行对比。. . 研究发现——主要结论如下：第一，当自由贸易下企业策略呈战略替代关系时，Dowrick（1986）与Balboa等（2004）提出的企业位次偏好排序结论在本模型中可能不成立；第二，古诺竞争下自由贸易与补贴制度的偏好排序与出口补贴战略贸易政策的研究结果一致；第三，除产品替代性或互补性极强的情况外，本模型关于企业位次的企业偏好与政府偏好结果与Balboa等（2004）存在差异：当产品为替代品时，补贴制度下的斯塔克尔伯格领导者具有优势，而互补品情形下则处于劣势。此外在补贴制度中，替代品情境下企业利润均衡值在古诺-纳什博弈时达到最高；第四，除极端替代/互补情形外，企业及其政府对贸易制度的偏好与Balboa等（2004）相似：替代品时斯塔克尔伯格领导企业及政府倾向自由贸易，互补品时偏好补贴制度。而斯塔克尔伯格跟随企业及政府则强烈倾向补贴制度而非自由贸易。. . 创新点/价值——通过分析国际市场中研发补贴与出口补贴的效应，本研究揭示了二者在国际市场上的异同点。,"Cournot Competition, Free Trade, Process R&D, Stackelberg Competition, Subsidy Regime",2020-06-18

However, various stakeholders often find the issue of trade facilitation as ambiguous and it is important to have clear understanding of trade facilities for acting properly.

trade,Patterns of Vertical Intra-IndustryTradeConsidering Differences in Quality: The South Korean Case,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4210983,Minsung Kang,"The simultaneous exports and imports within same industries is well known as the intra-industry trade (IIT). Since the pioneering empirical literatures of Balassa (1966)1) and Grubel and Lloyd (1975)2), bunch of empirical and theoretical papers studied this new paradigm of international trade challenging to the classical Heckscher - Ohlin paradigm. On the steps of IIT studies, the most essential progress was the division of IIT into Horizontal IIT (HIIT) and Vertical IIT (VIIT). This classification is based on the characteristics of product differentiation. HIIT is the trade of product which is close substitute but differ in characteristics, on the contrary VIIT differ in embodied quality level.In empirical literatures, the division between HIIT and VIIT is accomplished by unit price comparison. If unit price ratio defined as export product price over import product price of product which belong to same industry goes to specific range, this trade is on HIIT and if that ratio is out of that range this kind of trade go to VIIT. This simple methodology have been very common practical way for IIT research and generally the price ratio range for HIIT is 75~125% or 85~115%. In other words, if a product’s export price is higher than import price over 125% (or 115%) or lower than import price below 75% (or 85%), both cases are classified as VIIT. Another progress in IIT studies was the research on the determinants of HIIT/VIIT. Various countryand industry-specific determinants have been studied and differences in factor endowments and market size, physical and/or institutional barrier against trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) are the key elements determining IIT in country level.Though these determinants have been studied extensively during past decades, little is known of the impact of national technological capacity on IIT. Considering VIIT as occurring from product differentiation with quality difference, this is very surprising.In these perspectives, this paper investigates the determinants of Korea’s VIIT with special interest on national R&D stock. Classical analysis of VIIT will be followed by separated investigation of HQ-VIIT (Higher Quality VIIT) and LQ-VIIT (Lower Quality VIIT). This segregated analysis will give deepened understanding of VIIT determinants.",同一行业内同时存在的出口与进口现象被称为产业内贸易(IIT)。自Balassa(1966)和Grubel与Lloyd(1975)的开创性实证研究以来，大量实证与理论文献开始研究这一挑战传统赫克歇尔-俄林范式的新型国际贸易模式。在产业内贸易研究进程中，最重要的进展是将产业内贸易划分为水平型产业内贸易(HIIT)与垂直型产业内贸易(VIIT)。这种分类基于产品差异化的特征：水平型产业内贸易指特性不同但可相互替代的产品贸易，而垂直型产业内贸易则体现为产品质量等级的差异。. . 在实证研究中，通常采用单位价格比较法区分水平型与垂直型产业内贸易。若某行业产品出口单价与进口单价比值处于特定区间（通常为75%~125%或85%~115%），则归为水平型产业内贸易；若超出该区间则视为垂直型产业内贸易。这种简易方法已成为产业内贸易研究的通行做法。具体而言，当某产品出口价格高于进口价格125%（或115%）以上，或低于进口价格75%（或85%）以下时，均被归类为垂直型产业内贸易。. . 产业内贸易研究的另一进展是对其决定因素的探索。学者们研究了诸多国家与行业层面的影响因素，发现要素禀赋差异、市场规模、贸易与外商直接投资(FDI)的实体/制度壁垒是国家层面产业内贸易的关键决定因素。尽管这些因素在过去数十年得到广泛研究，但国家技术能力对产业内贸易的影响却鲜有涉及——考虑到垂直型产业内贸易源于产品质量差异形成的产品差异化，这一研究空白令人意外。. . 基于上述背景，本文重点考察韩国垂直型产业内贸易的决定因素，特别关注国家研发存量的影响。在经典垂直型产业内贸易分析基础上，本文还将分别研究高质量垂直型产业内贸易(HQ-VIIT)与低质量垂直型产业内贸易(LQ-VIIT)，这种分类研究将深化对垂直型产业内贸易决定机制的理解。,"intra-industry trade, IIT, trade goods, classification, global trade, trade policy, trade determinants, product differentiation, R&D, R&D policy, Korea",2022-12-06

The strategic choices are a result of asymmetric information on demand parameters and a firm’s cost structure. In this paper, we will suggest the optimal policy of eliciting private information from domestic firms. The policy is a contract of menus, comprising a tariff and a production subsidy (henceforth, subsidy). When one domestic firm and another foreign firm compete in a duopolistic domestic market, we consider unilateral intervention of the domestic government. The domestic firm privately holds information on the industrial cost structure. The main findings are as follows. First, the two policies can be equivalent conditionally. We will provide conditions for equivalence. Second, the domestic firm has an incentive to misreport the industrial cost structure to the government. Using a menu of a tariff and a subsidy (in combination with a lump-sum transfer), the government can screen the domestic firm’s marginal cost. That is, the menu leads the domestic firm to disclose private information.",近来，战略性保护贸易政策逐渐兴起。这些策略选择源于需求参数与企业成本结构之间的信息不对称。本文旨在提出一种最优政策，用以从国内企业获取私有信息。该政策采用菜单式合同形式，包含关税与生产补贴（以下简称补贴）的组合。当一家国内企业与一家国外企业在双寡头垄断的国内市场竞争时，我们考虑本国政府的单边干预行为。国内企业私有掌握着行业成本结构信息。主要研究发现如下：首先，两种政策在特定条件下可相互替代，我们将给出等价条件；其次，国内企业存在向政府虚报行业成本结构的动机。通过采用关税与补贴的组合菜单（配合定额转移支付），政府能够甄别国内企业的边际成本。这意味着该菜单机制将引导国内企业披露私有信息。,"Asymmetric Information, Contract, Incentive Scheme, International Trade",2019-01-15

First, that beyond a very narrow set of largely uncontroversial disciplines on domestic legislative reforms to facilitate or promote e-commerce and cooperate in this area, it has proven and will likely continue to prove extremely difficult to establish anything but the most superficial consensus with respect to meaningful new trade rules to govern the digital economy. Second, it argues that with respect to a second set of rules that seek to establish genuine and enforceable constraints to governments’ ability to effect harmful regulatory interventions in the digital economy, the textual outcomes that have emerged so far in trade agreements such as the CPTPP are so riddled with broadly formulated exceptions and carve-outs, that there is little prospect for business to obtain the predictability and certainty that these new rules should ideally promise. Finally, this article argues that a set of exogenous factors has conspired to make the need to establish consensus on new trade rules to govern the digital economy more urgent but also infinitely more difficult, including but not limited to a backlash against technology the rise in income inequality in advanced industrialized countries, a resurgence in protectionism, and an America no longer willing to show constructive leadership that threatens to permanently cripple the rules based multilateral trading system.",本文提出三个论点。首先，除了一系列极为有限且基本无争议的国内立法改革措施——这些措施旨在促进电子商务及该领域合作——事实证明，过去和未来都极难就数字经济治理方面有实质意义的新贸易规则达成任何超越表面共识的协议。其次，本文认为对于第二类规则——即试图真正且可执行地限制政府对数字经济实施有害监管干预的能力——目前《全面与进步跨太平洋伙伴关系协定》等贸易协定中形成的文本成果充斥着宽泛表述的例外条款和豁免规定，企业几乎无法通过这些新规则获得理论上应提供的可预测性和确定性。最后，本文指出一系列外部因素共同作用，使得就数字经济新贸易规则达成共识的需求变得更加紧迫，同时也无限复杂化。这些因素包括但不限于：对技术反弹的浪潮、发达工业化国家收入不平等的加剧、保护主义抬头，以及美国不再愿意展现建设性领导力——这种态势可能永久性破坏基于规则的多边贸易体系。,"multilateral trading system, digital trade, WTO, e-commerce negotiations, data localization",2020-09-29

trade,AccumulatingTradeCosts and Competitiveness in Global Value Chains,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2906866,Antonia Diakantoni,"Trade costs such as applied tariffs, transportation and insurance costs are amplified as they pass through the multiple production steps associated with modern supply chains. This so called ""cascade effect"" arises since trade costs accumulate as intermediate goods are imported and then re-exported further downstream, going through different processing nodes before reaching the final consumer. Moreover, the financial impact of these trade costs is magnified in the ""trade in tasks"" rationale which governs global value chains (GVCs). Specialised processing firms need to recoup the associated trade cost applying to the full value of the good from the smaller fraction of value-added created at each consecutive productive stage. This large relative weight of transaction expenses on the profitability of individual business operations explains why trade along GVCs is particularly exposed to trade costs. The paper reviews the implications of trade costs on competitiveness at industry, national and global levels. The financial implications of trade costs at firm and sectoral level are based on trade in value-added data for 2011. The multilateral welfare effects of reducing discrete trade costs are identified using a network analysis approach, which goes beyond the traditional bilateral dimension of international trade and identifies where trade facilitation investment would have the highest social returns from a GVC perspective. The authors conclude that while the direct benefits of trade facilitation will be proportionally higher for those countries that are not well integrated into international trade because of their high trade costs, the global benefits of trade facilitation investments will also be high if they are undertaken by key traders that lie at the core of global value chains.",诸如适用关税、运输和保险费用等贸易成本，在通过现代供应链的多个生产环节时会不断放大。这种所谓的“级联效应”之所以产生，是因为中间产品在进口后又被下游再次出口，经过不同加工节点最终到达终端消费者时，贸易成本会不断累积。此外，在支配全球价值链（GVCs）的“任务贸易”逻辑中，这些贸易成本的财务影响被进一步放大。专业化加工企业需要从每个连续生产阶段创造的较小增值部分中，收回适用于商品全部价值的相应贸易成本。交易费用对个体企业经营利润的这种巨大相对影响，解释了为何沿全球价值链进行的贸易尤其容易受到贸易成本的冲击。本文审视了贸易成本对行业、国家及全球层面竞争力的影响。基于2011年贸易增加值数据，研究量化了企业和行业层面贸易成本的财务影响。通过采用网络分析方法——该方法突破了传统国际贸易的双边维度，从全球价值链视角识别出贸易便利化投资能产生最高社会回报的节点——研究明确了降低离散型贸易成本带来的多边福利效应。作者得出结论：虽然贸易便利化的直接收益会因高贸易成本而与国际贸易融合度较低的国家成比例更高，但若处于全球价值链核心地位的关键贸易国实施便利化措施，其投资带来的全球收益同样将极为显著。,"Global Value Chains, Trade in value-added, International input-output analysis, Trade costs, Trade facilitation, Competitiveness, Effective rate of protection",2017-02-06

The specification provides a way for digitally executable versions of rules to be published on the Internet in a platform-agnostic open standard format, across all types of rule-makers and rule-takers, together with the means to allow efficient discovery and transmission of information about rules that are ‘in effect’, ‘applicable’ to any category of transaction, and to be ‘invoked’ by a particular transaction. Relations of obligation, permission, and encouragement can be expressed and understood in the natural language, including vernacular languages, of each stakeholder and equivalently by their heterogeneous computational systems. The resulting ‘Internet of Rules’ (IoR) is intended to enable computer-assisted rules-based coordination for human-centred algorithmic governance. To bolster the resilience of Africa’s markets to social, ecological, and epidemiological disruption, such a ‘Trade Policy 3.0’ approach would make it possible for users to automatically fetch rules via applications and, at the discretion of the parties, invoke rules to digitally automate cross-border compliance in alignment with the policies of national jurisdictions, Regional Economic Communities, and the AfCFTA framework.",本章提出了一种简单、可扩展且快速的计算方法原理，即通过“带方向的数据规范”（DWDS），以补充非洲大陆自由贸易区（AfCFTA）的实施。该规范提供了一种方式，使规则的数字可执行版本能够以平台无关的开放标准格式发布在互联网上，覆盖所有类型的规则制定者和规则接受者，同时提供了高效发现和传输关于“有效”、“适用于”任何类别交易的规则信息的手段，并允许特定交易“调用”这些规则。义务、许可和鼓励的关系可以用各利益相关方的自然语言（包括方言）表达和理解，并通过其异构计算系统等效实现。由此形成的“规则互联网”（IoR）旨在实现以人为中心的算法治理中基于规则的计算机辅助协调。为增强非洲市场对社会、生态和流行病干扰的韧性，这种“贸易政策3.0”方法使用户能够通过应用程序自动获取规则，并在各方自主决定的情况下调用规则，以数字化方式自动实现跨境合规，与国家司法管辖区、区域经济共同体和AfCFTA框架的政策保持一致。,"AfCFTA, trade, digital trade, trade facilitation, e-commerce, e-transactions law, law, Regional Economic Commissions, Internet, Computational Law, digital law, trade law, finance, tax, algorithmic law, algorithmic governance",2022-12-09
trade,Is IntraregionalTradean Opportunity for Industrial Upgrading in East Africa?,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4198650,Hyeseon Na,"Regional trade or regional integration is becoming increasingly important. According to Milberg et al (2013), in the post-Washington Consensus world of today, regional trade and integration are promoted not only to expand markets but also to create regional production networks, especially in the electronics sector of East Asia and the apparel industry of Southern Africa.However, intraregional trade in Africa is limited relative to extraregional trade, especially when compared to Asia, North America and Europe, where intraregional trade volume in intermediate goods exceeds extraregional trade. Intraregional trade in intermediate goods in Africa is just one third of the extraregional trade (Ahmed & Primi, 2017, p. 78). So it is fair to say that thus far African nations have missed the opportunity to enhance value addition in production through intraregional trade.From this point of view, this paper analyzes both intra- and extra-regional trade in Africa, focusing on East Africa, to determine whether intraregional trade can serve as an opportunity not only to bolster broad-based industrial development but critically to upgrade the value added of East African industrial products. For this paper, industrial upgrading refers to the process of industrial improvement on the value chain, from the production of low-value goods to higher value-added products or services.",区域贸易或区域一体化正变得越来越重要。根据Milberg等人（2013年）的研究，在当今后华盛顿共识的世界中，推动区域贸易和一体化不仅是为了扩大市场，更是为了建立区域生产网络，特别是在东亚的电子行业和南部非洲的服装行业。然而，非洲区域内贸易相对于区域外贸易较为有限，尤其是与亚洲、北美和欧洲相比，这些地区的中间产品区域内贸易量超过了区域外贸易。非洲中间产品的区域内贸易仅为区域外贸易的三分之一（Ahmed & Primi，2017年，第78页）。因此可以说，迄今为止，非洲国家错失了通过区域内贸易提升生产附加值的机会。从这个角度来看，本文分析了非洲的区域内和区域外贸易，重点研究东非地区，以确定区域内贸易是否不仅可以作为促进广泛工业发展的机会，更重要的是能否提升东非工业产品的附加值。在本文中，产业升级指的是在价值链上实现工业改进的过程，从生产低价值产品转向更高附加值的产品或服务。,"interregional trade, extraregional trade, regional trade, industrial upgrading, Africa, apparel industry, inter-African trade, trade networks, regional trade networks, regional integration, trade integration, intraregional trade",2022-12-27
trade,"ServicesTrade, Distance, and the Internet",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4467509,Sarah Oliver,"While gravity models of trade perform well in empirical tests of both goods and services, efforts to tailor gravity models to the unique features of services trade have been limited. In particular, since trade in services can be conducted via travel or directly over the internet, trade costs vary both across trade partners and within products. This paper proposes that interacting the level of internet connectivity with a measure of physical distance can help shed light on the unique role of the internet as a direct means of trading services. On aggregate and for 7 of the 10 services sectors considered, increases in the level of internet connectivity across country-pairs significantly decrease distance costs for services trade. The decrease in distance costs ranges from 3–32 percent, depending on the sector and level of internet connectivity. However, this result does not hold for aggregate goods trade using the same sample of countries.",尽管引力模型在商品和服务贸易的实证检验中表现良好，但针对服务贸易独特特征定制引力模型的努力仍然有限。特别是由于服务贸易可以通过旅行或直接通过互联网进行，贸易成本在不同贸易伙伴之间和产品内部都存在差异。本文提出，将互联网连接水平与物理距离指标相互作用，有助于揭示互联网作为服务贸易直接渠道的独特作用。总体而言，在所考察的10个服务部门中有7个部门，国家间互联网连接水平的提高显著降低了服务贸易的距离成本。距离成本的降幅从3%到32%不等，具体取决于部门和互联网连接水平。然而，在使用相同国家样本的总体商品贸易中，这一结果并不成立。,"International trade, services trade, gravity model, trade costs, trade and technology",2023-06-04
trade,Addressing Negative Effects ofTradeLiberalization: Unilateral and Mutually Agreed Flanking Policies,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5008713,Joost Pauwelyn,"The conventional approach to trade liberalization has been to liberalize trade through international agreement and address subsequent domestic fallout and spillovers through domestic policies. In consequence, international obligations in trade liberalization are not legally connected with ‘flanking’ measures to address their negative effects. We discuss the shortcomings of this conventional approach with respect to labor adjustment and environmental protection: for political reasons, trade liberalization requires today the simultaneous regulation of labor and environmental spillovers. We suggest a novel approach to trade liberalization that includes the necessary flanking policies as part of, or linked to, the international agreement itself. This novel approach seeks to achieve the best of both worlds: reaping the benefits of international trade while making sure that negative spillovers are effectively addressed. To illustrate the intricacies of this approach, we introduce a new conceptual framework covering the negative effects of trade liberalization and flanking or mitigating policies, and a proposed novel approach in the form of trade liberalization packages and package treaties. Trade liberalization packages and package treaties are currently emerging around the world (see e.g. sustainable palm oil in EFTA–Indonesia) and deserve our close attention.","传统的贸易自由化方法是通过国际协定实现贸易自由化，并通过国内政策应对随后的国内影响和溢出效应。因此，贸易自由化的国际义务在法律上与解决其负面影响的""配套""措施并无关联。我们讨论了这一传统方法在劳动力调整和环境保护方面的不足：出于政治原因，当今的贸易自由化需要同时对劳动力和环境溢出效应进行监管。我们提出了一种新的贸易自由化方法，将必要的配套政策作为国际协定本身的一部分或与之相关联。这一新方法旨在实现两全其美：既获得国际贸易的收益，又确保有效解决负面溢出效应。为了说明这一方法的复杂性，我们引入了一个新的概念框架，涵盖贸易自由化的负面影响及配套或缓解政策，并以贸易自由化一揽子方案和条约的形式提出了这一新方法。目前，贸易自由化一揽子方案和条约正在全球范围内兴起（例如EFTA与印度尼西亚的可持续棕榈油协议），值得我们密切关注。","anti-trade sentiments, regulatory silos, environmental protection, labor adjustment, flanking, package treaties",2025-01-08
trade,Tradein Health Products: ReducingTradeBarriers for Better Health,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2955559,Matthias Helble,"Trade in health products has been flourishing in recent years as the demand for better health has been growing throughout the world. At the same time, trade in health products is hampered by substantive trade barriers. In this paper, we present evidence that countries around the world still apply tariffs and nontariff measures that increase prices and limit the availability of health-related products such as pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and medical equipment. The case for liberalizing trade in these products is therefore strong. In addition, we show that improving trade facilitation performance, using the World Trade Organization’s Trade Facilitation Agreement as a starting point, can be linked to improved handling of health-related products such as vaccines which, in turn, would boost usage. In the last part of the paper, we study the price differences for insulin across countries. We observe that the price of insulin has various determinants, one of them being open trade: the higher the level of competition between manufacturers, the lower the price of insulin. In summary, lowering trade barriers on health products can make a substantive contribution to building up health systems and lowering out-of-pocket payments of patients.",近年来，随着全球对健康需求的不断增长，健康产品的贸易蓬勃发展。与此同时，健康产品贸易也受到实质性贸易壁垒的阻碍。本文提供的证据表明，世界各国仍在实施关税和非关税措施，这些措施提高了药品、疫苗和医疗设备等健康相关产品的价格并限制了其可获得性。因此，放开这些产品的贸易具有充分理由。此外，我们还表明，以世界贸易组织的《贸易便利化协定》为起点，提高贸易便利化绩效可以与改善疫苗等健康相关产品的处理相关联，从而促进其使用。在本文的最后部分，我们研究了各国胰岛素的价格差异。我们观察到，胰岛素的价格有多种决定因素，其中之一是开放的贸易：制造商之间的竞争越激烈，胰岛素的价格就越低。总之，降低健康产品的贸易壁垒可以为建立卫生系统和降低患者自付费用做出实质性贡献。,"Trade, Trade Barriers, Health Products, Pharmaceuticals, Tariffs, Non-Tariff Measures, Trade Liberalization, WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement, Vaccine, Insulin",2017-04-21
trade,A Novel Framework to Evaluate Changes in Access to and Costs ofTradeFinance,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4466671,Marc Auboin,"In this paper we integrate the costs of trade finance in a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to evaluate the trade and output effects of counterfactual policy experiments on costs of and access to trade finance. The costs of financing international trade consist of two components: the financial costs and the costs associated with the risk of goods not being delivered, considering risk aversion of traders. These costs are determined for four ways to finance international trade (cash-in-advance, trade loans, letters of credit, and exports financed with internal working capital). Trade finance costs are a weighted average of the costs under the four different ways of financing. The framework is applied to trade of four ECOWAS countries employing data collected on financial costs, costs of risk and trade finance instrument shares through a comprehensive bank survey in these countries complemented with data from the literature. Counterfactual experiments on increases in the availability of letters of credit and trade loans and the costs of these instruments show that raising the shares and costs to African averages would increase trade of the four ECOWAS countries by about 11%. The framework is generic and can be applied to other countries.",本文通过将贸易融资成本纳入可计算一般均衡（CGE）模型，评估了关于贸易融资成本与可获得性的反事实政策实验对贸易和产出的影响。国际贸易融资成本包含两个组成部分：财务成本，以及考虑交易者风险厌恶情况下货物未交付风险相关的成本。这些成本针对四种国际贸易融资方式（预付款、贸易贷款、信用证、利用内部营运资金融资的出口）分别确定。贸易融资成本是四种不同融资方式下成本的加权平均值。该框架应用于四个西非国家经济共同体（ECOWAS）成员国的贸易分析，采用通过全面银行调查收集的财务成本、风险成本及贸易融资工具份额数据，并辅以文献数据。关于信用证和贸易贷款可获得性提升及其成本增加的反事实实验表明，将这些指标提升至非洲平均水平将使四个ECOWAS成员国的贸易量增长约11%。该框架具有普适性，可应用于其他国家。,"trade credit, international trade, financial institutions, general equilibrium simulations",2023-06-06

Part II provides an overview of financial markets, tracing developments prior to and subsequent to the financial crisis. It focuses on global market trends, specifically the potential of microfinance, South-South trade in financial services, outsourcing in the financial services sector and Islamic finance. Part III takes a closer look at the financial crisis in terms of its causes, costs, potential impact on developing countries and more broadly policy implications for the financial sector as a whole.

Marchetti,"Rising current account and merchandise trade imbalances marked the years before the global financial and economic crisis. These imbalances either contributed to or precipitated the crisis and to the extent that they create systemic risks, it is desirable that they be reduced. There are many factors related to macroeconomic, structural, exchange rate and financial policies that contributed to the imbalances. The inability to manage these issues at the international level reflects the “coherence gap” in global governance. This paper examines the contribution that the WTO can make in its three areas of activities — negotiations, rule-making and dispute settlement — to deal with trade imbalances and with the main factors leading to them, including exchange rate misalignments. First, market opening efforts in services, including in the area of financial services, can reduce policy-related distortions and market imperfections in surplus countries that lead to the build-up of unsustainable imbalances. Second, in the context of a broad international effort to coordinate macroeconomic, exchange rate and structural policies to deal with the roots of imbalances (the first-best solution), there is a general efficiency argument that could be made for the use of WTO-triggered trade actions to enforce cooperative behaviour towards rebalancing.

The model is then used to formally probe the role of vertical integration in explaining changes in trade elasticity. Aggregated results on long-term trade elasticity tend to support the hypothesis that world economy has undertaken in the late 1980s a ""traverse"" between two underlying economic models.

Two supply chains related effects (the composition and the bullwhip effects) explain also the overshooting of trade elasticity that occurred during the 2008-2009 trade collapse.

Водночас продемонстровано вплив зміни атрибуції актора на ставлення студентів до розбудови кар’єри в торгівлі в тіньовій економіці України. Це дало підстави розробити алгоритм формування ставлення особи до проблеми розбудови кар’єри в тіньовій економіці України (5). У дисертаційній роботі набули подальшого розвитку наукові уявлення щодо феномену переживання завчасного професійного старіння студентської молоді (6).Наукові пошуки та здобутки висвітлено в чотирьох розділах дисертації. Загалом було проведено шість експериментальних та одне кореляційне дослідження, в яких сумарно 3693 студенти та 116 викладачів взяли участь.У першому розділі “Психологія кар’єри: теоретичні аспекти” розкрито питання множинності кар’єрних досліджень у вітчизняній та західній психології. У другому розділі “Зарплатні стереотипи в торгівлі” встановлено, що студенти, які навчаються на спеціалізаціях “Оптова та роздрібна торгівля” і “Міжнародна торгівля” мають стереотип, пов’язаний зі сприйняттям міжнародної спеціалізації як більш прибуткової. У третьому розділі “Психолого-правові аспекти кар’єри в торгівлі” визначено ставлення студентів Київського національного торговельно-економічного університету до проблеми розбудови кар’єри в тіньовій економіці. У четвертому розділі “Часові перспективи та кар’єрні амбіції студентів торговельного спрямування” встановлено, що часова перспектива є чинником розбудови кар’єри.На основі отриманих нами емпіричним шляхом наукових фактів у дисертаційній роботі виокремлено 18 чинників розбудови кар’єри в торгівлі: гендер, курс, навчальна успішність, спеціалізація, зайнятість, стереотип сприйняття міжнародної спеціалізації як більш прибуткової, зарплатні очікування, часова перспектива, впевненість у спроможності швидкого працевлаштування, впевненість у професійному виборі, амбіції закордонного навчання та працевлаштування, очікування кількості підлеглих та переваг отримання диплому магістра, зміна атрибуції актора, прояв емпатії та набуття підприємницького досвіду, як чинники формування толерантного ставлення до несплати податків, та правосвідомість, як чинник протидії.Виокремлені чинники розбудови кар’єри в торгівлі були класифіковані за відношенням до закону на дві групи: чинники розбудови кар’єри в формальній та неформальній (тіньовій) економіці України.

Левіним.English Abstract:The dissertation is submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of the Doctor of Philosophy (Social and Behavioral Sciences, Specialty in “Psychology”) at the Kyiv National University of Trade and Economics. 2021.The dissertation describes research problems related to career development in trade. New empirically scientific facts are discussed presenting the psychological factors influencing career development in trade.The purpose of this study was to identify the psychological factors influencing career development in trade. The goal aims to achieve the following objectives:1) To describe the theoretical problem in the field of trade,2) To reveal salary stereotypes in trade,3) To study students’ attitude toward the problem of career development in trade in the Ukraine shadow economy,4) To present career ambitions and time perspectives of students specializing in trade,5) To develop a psychological assistance algorithm that facilitates career decision that considers the stereotype of perceiving international specialization as more profitable,6) To develop an algorithm that forms attitudes to the problem in career development in the Ukraine shadow economy.For the first time, this study presents a scientific novelty that focuses on the classification of career development in trade in both the formal and informal (shadow) economy of Ukraine) (1). For the first time, this study also presents a novel scientific insight that classifies career development factors in trade (personal and environmental factors based on Levin’s formula) (2). The thesis also reveals the stereotype of perceiving international specialization as more profitable. An algorithm is developed to correct this perception providing psychological assistance for making a career decision while considering the stereotype of perceiving international specialization as more profitable (3). In addition, the thesis reveals the peculiarities of career development in the Ukraine shadow economy. Entrepreneurial experience and empathy are factors influencing tax evasion, and the acquisition of legal awareness is a countermeasure (4). At the same time, this thesis demonstrated the influence of the change in the attribution of an actor (effect of neutral, first, and third perspectives) on the student attitude to the career trade development in the Ukraine shadow economy. In this regard, an algorithm was developed to form an attitude toward the problem of career development in the Ukraine shadow economy (5). The dissertation work further developed scientific ideas regarding the “feeling old” phenomena and career-building for young students (6).Four sections cover scientific research and achievements. Six experimental studies and one correlation study were conducted: 3693 students and 116 teachers participated. The dissertation is organized as follows:Chapter I discusses the theoretical aspects of career psychology and different studies focusing on career building in Ukrainian and Western psychology. Chapter 2 discusses “salary stereotypes in trade” considering the problem of perception of international specializations as more profitable. Chapter 3 discusses the “psychological and legal aspects of a career in trade” and defines the students’ attitude of the Kyiv National University of Trade and Economics to the problem of career development in the Ukraine shadow economy. Chapter 4 explores the “time perspectives and career ambitions of trade students”.Based on the empirical evidence obtained from scientific facts, 18 factors of career development in trade are identified: gender, course, grade point average, specialization, employment, the stereotype of perception of international specialization as more profitable, salary expectations, time perspective, career ambition to be hired quickly, confidence in professional choice, ambitions to study and work abroad, career expectations of the number of subordinates, the benefits of obtaining a master’s degree. Change in the attribution of the actor (an effect of neutral, first, and third perspectives), empathy, and entrepreneurial experience were factors to form a tolerant attitude to tax evasion; legal awareness has an opposite effect.From a law perspective, the resulting factors influencing career development in trade were classified into two groups: factors of career development in the 1) formal and 2) informal (shadow) economy of Ukraine. The alternative classification from Shatilova identified 1) personal and 2) environmental factors of career development in trade using Levin’s formula.","英文摘要：本论文为申请哲学博士学位（社会与行为科学领域，心理学专业）提交的部分研究成果。基辅国立贸易与经济大学，2021年。. . 论文研究了贸易领域职业发展问题，呈现了通过实证研究获得的新科学事实，并据此提炼出影响贸易职业发展的心理因素。研究主要目标是识别贸易职业发展的心理因素，通过完成以下任务实现：1）阐述职业发展问题的理论层面；2）揭示贸易领域的薪资（职业）刻板印象；3）探究学生对乌克兰影子经济中贸易职业发展问题的态度；4）呈现贸易专业学生的时间观与职业抱负；5）开发考虑""国际专业更盈利""刻板印象的职业决策心理辅助算法；6）制定针对乌克兰影子经济职业发展问题的个人态度塑造算法。. . 科学创新体现在：首次建立包含乌克兰正式与非正式（影子）经济职业发展因素的分类体系（1）；基于勒温行为公式首创包含个人与环境因素的分类框架（2）。研究发现了""国际专业更盈利""的认知刻板印象（以""国际贸易""与""批发零售贸易""专业对比为例），据此开发了修正该刻板印象的职业决策辅助算法（3）；揭示了乌克兰影子经济中职业发展特征——创业经验与共情能力助长税收容忍度，而法律意识则起抑制作用（4）；证实了行动者归因变化对学生态度的影响，进而制定影子经济职业发展态度塑造算法（5）；深化了关于学生群体""过早职业老化""现象的研究（6）。. . 研究通过四章展开，包含6项实验和1项相关性研究，共涉及3693名学生和116名教师。第一章阐述职业心理学的理论基础；第二章揭示贸易专业学生存在的""国际专业更盈利""薪资刻板印象；第三章分析学生对影子经济中职业发展的态度；第四章证实时间观是职业发展影响因素。. . 通过实证研究最终确定18个贸易职业发展影响因素：性别、年级、学业成绩、专业方向、就业状况、""国际专业更盈利""刻板印象、薪资预期、时间观、快速就业信心、专业选择确信度、海外求学与就业抱负、下属数量预期、硕士学位收益预期、行动者归因变化、共情能力与创业经验（助长税收容忍度）及法律意识（抑制因素）。这些因素按法律属性分为正式与非正式（影子）经济两类，另按勒温公式划分为个人与环境因素。","career, psychology, salary, ambition, stereotype, expectation, student, educational program, trade, tax evasion, shadow economy, кар’єра, психологія, зарплата, амбіції, стереотипи, очікування, студенти, освітня програма, торгівля, несплата податків, тіньова економіка",2022-07-22
trade,Binding Constraints toTradeExpansion: Aid forTradeObjectives and Diagnostics Tools,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1521409,Jean-Jacques Hallaert,"Trade can be a powerful engine for economic growth, poverty reduction, and development. However, harnessing the power of trade is often difficult for developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, because of supply-side domestic constraints (lack of trade-related infrastructure and capacity). The Aid for Trade Initiative was launched to address these constraints. This paper sets forth strategies to identify the most binding constraints to trade expansion so countries and donors can channel resources toward reforms and projects that have the largest effect. It shows that the four most common objectives of aid-for-trade projects (increasing trade, diversifying exports, maximizing the linkages with the domestic economy, and increasing adjustment capacity) have the potential to boost growth and reduce poverty in developing countries. However, the potential of trade may not be realized as developing countries often face binding constraints that prevent them from turning trade opportunities into trade, and trade into growth. First, they face difficulties turning trade opportunities into trade flows because of capacity constraints and lack of adequate trade-related infrastructure. Second, some domestic constraints choke the impact of trade expansion on economic growth. The paper focuses on the first set of constraints and presents various diagnostic tools available to identify them. These tools often pinpoint a long list of constraints. As all constraints cannot be addressed simultaneously, there is a need to identify the most binding ones in order to prioritize reforms. The paper suggests combining the different diagnostic tools in an appropriate framework to achieve this prioritization. An adaptation of the growth diagnostics can be such a framework. By shifting the focus from growth to trade, this framework can be readily adapted by local authorities and development practitioners.","贸易可以成为经济增长、减贫和发展的强大引擎。然而，发展中国家尤其是最不发达国家由于供给侧国内制约因素（缺乏与贸易相关的基础设施和能力），往往难以发挥贸易的推动作用。""贸易援助倡议""正是为应对这些制约因素而启动。本文提出了一系列识别贸易扩张最紧迫制约因素的策略，以便各国和捐助方将资源投向能产生最大效果的改革和项目。研究表明，贸易援助项目最常见的四大目标（扩大贸易规模、促进出口多元化、最大化与国内经济的联动效应、提升调整适应能力）有望推动发展中国家经济增长并减少贫困。但贸易潜力可能无法充分释放，因为这些国家常面临刚性约束，使其难以将贸易机遇转化为实际贸易活动，再将贸易转化为经济增长。首先，受能力限制和贸易基础设施不足影响，他们难以将贸易机会转变为贸易流量；其次，部分国内制约因素削弱了贸易扩张对经济增长的促进作用。本文重点探讨第一类制约因素，介绍了多种可用于识别这些问题的诊断工具。这些工具通常会列出一长串制约因素，由于无法同时解决所有问题，必须识别最关键的制约因素以确定改革优先级。文章建议在适当框架内综合运用不同诊断工具来实现优先排序，调整后的""增长诊断法""可作为此类框架。通过将关注点从增长转向贸易，该框架能方便地被当地政府和发展实践者采用。","Aid for Trade, trade expansion, export diversification, supply-side constraints, infrastructure, trade capacities, binding constraints to trade, diagnostic tools, trade and growth, trade reform",2009-12-13

trade,The Economic Interest Test in UKTradeRemedy Investigations,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4388540,Ilona Serwicka,"The UK’s Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) conducts economic assessment of the ramifications of trade remedies, the Economic Interest Test (EIT). Such assessments are not mandated by the World Trade Organization but are conducted by certain trade remedy investigating authorities, including those of Brazil, Canada, the European Union and New Zealand. The EIT is a mandatory part of the UK trade remedy system and is arguably more transparent than similar interest tests conducted by other trade remedy investigating authorities. However, stakeholder participation remains a challenge and the TRA is working on ways to improve participation. To date the TRA has completed 11 EITs in its trade remedy cases, with a further ten live cases. These cases cover different products, markets and countries, across which the likely positive and negative impacts of trade remedy differ.

trade,RecentTradeDynamics in Asia: Examples from Specific Industries,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3274570,Marc Auboin,"This paper looks at the extent to which the shift in the lower value added production to countries in the following development “tier” is actually becoming a reality. Several countries in East Asia have been upgrading production patterns and moving up the value chain, this paper looks at how this helps and offers new opportunities to less advanced countries to integrate in world trade. The paper uses a combination of techniques, from an analysis of disaggregated trade flows by country and sectors, to the calculation of trade intensity indices by country and sector, and value-added trade by sector. It finds combined evidence of forward and backward trade increasing between several neighbouring Asian economies and China, in the most labour-intensive industries in particular. Econometric analysis shows that relative unit labour costs are an explanatory factor of increased trade links. In cases, the intensification of trade links on the export side can relate to a strongly expanding local market (for example India for electronic products such as smartphones), but mostly the intensification of trade links takes place both on the import and export sides with markets which are much smaller than China (Vietnam, Bangladesh, etc.), and which experienced increased outward-processing activities as a result of China's production upgrade.",本文探讨了低附加值生产向下一发展“梯队”国家转移的程度是否正在成为现实。东亚多个国家正通过升级生产模式向价值链上游攀升，研究分析了这一趋势如何为欠发达国家融入世界贸易提供助力与新机遇。论文综合运用多种分析方法，包括分国别和行业的贸易流量解析、国别与行业的贸易强度指数测算，以及分行业的增加值贸易核算。研究发现，在劳动密集型产业领域，多个亚洲邻近经济体与中国之间的前向和后向贸易均呈现增长态势。计量经济分析表明，相对单位劳动力成本是贸易联系增强的解释性因素。某些情况下，出口端贸易联系的强化可能与快速扩张的本地市场相关（如印度智能手机等电子产品市场），但多数贸易联系的增强同时发生在进出口两端，且对象是远小于中国规模的市场（如越南、孟加拉等国），这些国家因中国产业升级而承接了更多外包加工活动。,"investment, trade policy, business cycles",2018-11-06

Opinions vary on how much was achieved, and, perhaps more importantly, where the WTO goes from here. The United States and the European Union have emphasized that “new” issues and approaches should guide WTO negotiations in the future. But it is not clear what that means, and how it relates to the “old” issues and approaches. And with the rise of mega-regional trade negotiations, such as the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), there are serious questions about the WTO’s role as a negotiating forum for trade liberalization.

Using a bilateral measure of internet connectivity, we find a significant positive relationship between the internet and both domestic and international trade for goods and services---at the both the intensive and extensive margin.  We also find that digital trade facilitation provisions in trade agreements have significantly increased trade in services but not goods. These findings highlight that digital trade determinants play different roles for goods and services: the internet is beneficial for goods trade but critical for services. Finally, using a general equilibrium model of trade, we assess the trade and welfare impacts of increased internet connectivity in developing countries and find that increases in internet use can have large positive impacts on poorly connected countries. However, it also highlights the danger of developing countries falling behind as the digital economy continues to grow.",我们评估了互联网连接和数字贸易政策对贸易与福利的影响。通过采用双边互联网连接指标，我们发现互联网与商品及服务的国内国际贸易（包括集约边际和扩展边际）均存在显著正向关联。研究还表明，贸易协定中的数字贸易便利化条款显著促进了服务贸易，但对商品贸易影响有限。这些发现凸显出数字贸易决定因素对商品和服务具有不同作用：互联网对商品贸易有益，但对服务贸易至关重要。最后，我们运用贸易一般均衡模型评估了发展中国家提升互联网连接度对贸易和福利的影响，发现互联网使用率的提升能为网络基础设施薄弱的国家带来巨大积极影响。但研究也警示，随着数字经济持续发展，发展中国家存在进一步落后的风险。,"Digital trade, gravity, internet, development, data policies, international trade, domestic trade, services, extensive margin",2021-11-08

Egger,"We undertake a trade-growth accounting exercise by decomposing data on changes in bilateral international trade flows into their direct (endowment accumulation, productivity growth, changes in trade costs, changing preferences) and indirect components (general equilibrium effects). Furthermore, we distinguish between the (potentially partly endogenous) direct and the deep drivers of trade by extending standard new trade models to include endogenous factor accumulation, R&D driven productivity growth, and endogenous changes in expenditures shares on manufacturing goods and services. We quantify the importance of the direct and deep drivers of the growth of bilateral and multilateral trade of 67 economies over 20 consecutive years since 1988 for three trade outcomes: changes in growth rates across different country pairs, changes in levels of trade flows, and changes in trade to GDP ratio. The results suggest that changes in shocks to endogenous endowment accumulation and trade costs have been the most important drivers of trade in the sample at hand, whereas productivity growth and changes in preferences appear to have been quantitatively less important.",我们通过将双边国际贸易流量变化的数据分解为直接（要素禀赋积累、生产率增长、贸易成本变化、偏好变动）和间接成分（一般均衡效应），开展了一项贸易增长核算分析。此外，我们通过扩展标准新贸易模型，纳入内生要素积累、研发驱动的生产率增长以及制造业产品与服务支出份额的内生变化，区分了（可能部分内生的）直接驱动因素与深层贸易驱动因素。我们量化了1988年以来连续20年间67个经济体双边及多边贸易增长中直接与深层驱动因素对三类贸易结果的重要性：不同国家间增长率差异的变化、贸易流量水平的变化以及贸易占GDP比率的变化。结果表明，在现有样本中，内生禀赋积累冲击与贸易成本的变化始终是贸易最重要的驱动因素，而生产率增长与偏好变化的量化影响相对较小。,"international trade, trade-growth accounting, trade costs",2016-04-22

Using an inductive research approach, this study examines how impact investing organizations adopt control mechanisms to manage impact risk. It finds that impact investors adopt a wide range of input, behavior, and output control mechanisms to manage impact risk that may arise from investee-level, investor-level, and system-level operations. Also, to manage impact risk, investors establish control mechanisms to influence relevant actors not only within a firm’s boundary but also outside its boundary. Given the inherent complexity and ambiguity in managing impact risk in impact investing, control mechanisms appear to rely heavily on judgment and experience and adhere more to the “satisficing” principle. Furthermore, investors tend to focus more on managing positive impact risk than negative impact risk.",在影响力投资中，影响风险包括投资项目可能无法实现预期积极影响（即积极影响风险）和/或可能产生负面影响（即负面影响风险）的概率。本研究采用归纳研究方法，探讨影响力投资组织如何采用控制机制来管理影响风险。研究发现，影响力投资者采用多种输入、行为和输出控制机制，以管理可能来自被投企业层面、投资者层面和系统层面运营的影响风险。此外，为管理影响风险，投资者不仅在公司边界内建立控制机制以影响相关行为者，还在公司边界外采取相应措施。鉴于影响力投资中管理影响风险固有的复杂性和模糊性，控制机制似乎严重依赖判断和经验，并更倾向于遵循“满意化”原则。此外，投资者往往更注重管理积极影响风险，而非负面影响风险。,Impact Risk Management; Impact Investing; Impact Investor; Positive Impact Risk; Negative Impact Risk; Risk Control Mechanism; Investment Project; Nonfinancial Risk; Management Control System,2022-12-15

risk control,ERM in an OptimalControlFramework,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2660026,Greg Taylor,"Much of ERM consists of qualitative discussion of the risks facing a business and controls over them. It is difficult to identify in the literature a clear body of theory to provide the foundation for the subject, integrating a business’s objectives with its risk controls. The present paper attempts this by formulation of ERM as an exercise in stochastic optimal control theory. Here there is a defined objective, which would usually include some aspect of profit, and a set of constraints (the risk controls). Optimal control theory provides a framework for balancing the one against the other, and also for considering whether or not particular risk controls are well advised. The paper accepts the COSO (2004) definition of ERM, and its associated ERM Integrated Framework. After definitions, preliminary discussion and establishment of the control theory set-up, the paper is organised with one section for each item of the ERM Integrated Framework. Each of these sections interprets that item within the control theory model. Risk controls may improve business performance, but they usually come at a cost. And the stronger the control, the greater may be the improvement, but the greater the cost. The essential purpose of the control theoretic formulation is the identification of the optimal strength of each risk control as that at which, for marginal further strengthening, the marginal improvement of business function is matched by marginal cost.",企业风险管理（ERM）很大程度上包含对企业面临风险及其管控措施的定性讨论。现有文献中很难找到一个明确的理论体系，将企业目标与风险控制相结合，从而为该学科奠定基础。本文试图通过将ERM构建为随机最优控制理论的实践来解决这一问题。该理论设定了一个明确目标（通常包含利润要素）和一组约束条件（风险控制措施）。最优控制理论提供了平衡二者关系的框架，同时也能评估特定风险控制措施是否合理。本文采用COSO（2004）对ERM的定义及其配套的《ERM整合框架》。在完成定义、初步讨论和控制理论框架搭建后，论文按照《ERM整合框架》的各个要素分章节展开，每章节均在控制理论模型下解读相应要素。风险控制可能提升企业绩效，但往往伴随成本。控制力度越强，绩效提升可能越大，相应成本也越高。控制理论框架的核心目标在于确定每个风险控制措施的最优强度——即当控制力度边际增强时，业务功能边际改善与控制边际成本达到平衡的临界点。,"enterprise risk management, ERM, optimal control theory, risk appetite",2015-10-31

risk control,On Recovery and Intensity's Correlation - A New Class of CreditRiskModels,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1155129,Raquel M. Gaspar,"We start by presenting a reduced-form multiple default type of model and derive abstract results on the influence of a state variable X on credit spreads, when both the intensity and the loss quota distribution are driven by X. The aim is to apply the results to a concrete real life situation, namely, to the influence of macroeconomic risks on credit spreads term structures. There has been increasing support in the empirical literature that both the probability of default (PD) and the loss given default (LGD) are correlated and driven by macroeconomic variables. Paradoxically, there has been very little effort from the theoretical literature to develop credit risk models that would include this possibility. A possible justification has to do with the increase in complexity this leads to, even for the ""treatable"" default intensity models. The goal of this paper is to develop the theoretical framework needed to handle this situation and, through numerical simulation, understand the impact on credit risk term structures of the macroeconomic risks. In the proposed model the state of the economy is modeled trough the dynamics of a market index, that enters directly on the functional form of both the intensity of default and the distribution of the loss quota q given default. Given this setup, we are able to make periods of economic depression, periods of higher default intensity as well as periods where low recovery is more likely, producing a business cycle effect. Furthermore, we allow for the possibility of an index volatility that depends negatively on the index level and show that, when we include this realistic feature, the impacts on the credit spread term structure are emphasized.","我们首先提出一个简化形式的多重违约类型模型，并推导出当违约强度和损失配额分布均受状态变量X驱动时，X对信用利差影响的抽象结果。目的是将这些结果应用于具体的现实情境，即宏观经济风险对信用利差期限结构的影响。实证文献日益支持违约概率（PD）和违约损失率（LGD）存在相关性且均受宏观经济变量驱动的观点。然而矛盾的是，理论文献却极少致力于开发包含这种可能性的信用风险模型。一个可能的解释在于，即便对于""可处理""的违约强度模型，这也会导致复杂性增加。本文目标是构建处理这种情况所需的理论框架，并通过数值模拟来理解宏观经济风险对信用风险期限结构的影响。在所提出的模型中，经济状态通过市场指数的动态变化来建模，该指数直接进入违约强度函数和违约条件下损失配额q的分布函数。基于此设置，我们能够模拟经济萧条时期——这些时期不仅违约强度更高，且低回收率的可能性更大，从而产生商业周期效应。此外，我们允许指数波动率与指数水平呈负相关，并证明当加入这一现实特征时，对信用利差期限结构的影响会被放大。","Credit risk, Sistematic risk, Intensity models, Recovery, Credit spreads",2008-07-04

Ittner,"Using data on a broad international sample of listed, private, and non-profit entities, we explore the influence of risk management value creation objectives on the incorporation of risk considerations in planning and control systems. The combination of detailed survey responses and archival data allow us to provide evidence on the adoption of a wide variety of risk-focused planning and control practices, to examine how these practices vary with risk management objectives, and to shed light on the performance implications of risk-focused planning and control practices and risk management objectives. Our results highlight the important influence that risk management value creation objectives can have on the use and benefits from risk-focused planning and control practices. Organizations that primarily focus on minimizing risks within budget or reducing the total cost of risks tend to make less use of these practices, have higher stock price volatility, and achieve lower firm value than those that have taken greater steps to holistically consider both the upsides and downsides of risk.",基于对上市企业、私营机构及非营利组织的广泛国际样本数据，我们探究了风险管理价值创造目标对规划与控制系统纳入风险考量程度的影响。通过结合详尽的问卷调查回复与档案数据，我们得以呈现各类风险导向型规划控制实践的应用现状，分析这些实践如何随风险管理目标而变化，并揭示风险导向型规划控制实践与风险管理目标对组织绩效的影响。研究结果凸显了风险管理价值创造目标对风险导向型规划控制实践应用及其效益的重要影响：相较于那些更全面权衡风险正反两面的组织，主要关注预算内风险最小化或降低风险总成本的企业往往较少采用此类实践，其股价波动性更高，最终实现的企业价值也较低。,"Enterprise risk management, ERM, Planning and control system design",2016-04-05
risk control,"Importance of adaptive baseline measurement monitoring and verification (MMV) studies at CCS projects: lessons from Aquistore, Saskatchewan, Canada",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5069861,Nadia Tarakki,"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is recognized as an essential technology for mitigating global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), and offers a viable pathway toward a low-carbon economy. Canada has emerged as a leader in CCS, with several operational projects and significant planned investments. However, public perception remains a persistent challenge, largely due to concerns about CO2 containment, as highlighted by incidents such as the historical Kerr complaints in Weyburn, Canada, where false leakage allegations led to extensive investigations.The success of CCS projects lies in the implementation of robust Measurement, Monitoring, and Verification (MMV) systems. Such systems ensure the safety and security of injected CO2. Surface MMV, specifically the comparison of surface soil gas emission patterns to pre-injection baselines, plays a key role in gaining public trust, as it provides insight into natural variability and demonstrates the ability to detect potential leaks. The Aquistore project is a state-of-the-art CCS science project in Saskatchewan, Canada, designed to test, among other things, the efficacy of MMV programs. The surface soil-gas MMV program at Aquistore uses mainly process-based indicators, including gas concentrations of CO2, oxygen (O2), nitrogen (N2), and the radiocarbon isotope CO2 (14CO2). Unlike other sites, these parameters were measured extensively in a pre-injection baseline study and subsequently monitored post-injection at regular bi-annual intervals.This paper examines the strengths and challenges of the process-based MMV approach while highlighting the role of adaptability over time, as demonstrated by the Aquistore experience. Since 2012, the surface soil-gas MMV program has evolved to address the changing project needs, integrating an adaptive sampling strategy that reduced resource demands while maintaining data integrity. Over a decade, a well-established baseline dataset, including pre-injection measurements, proved essential for accurate interpretation. Although no baseline geochemical surface soil-gas MMV research at this site has shown evidence of surface impacts due to CO2 injection, pre- and post-injection monitoring consistently identified old 14CO2 values. Initially, these 14CO2 signatures appeared to indicate fossil-sourced CO2 rising to the surface in parts of the monitoring area. However, further investigation revealed that these anomalous 14CO2 signatures predated injection and were linked to the microbial decomposition of weathered coal fragments from historic surface coal mining at the site. Without the extensive and adaptive baseline monitoring dataset, these findings could have been misinterpreted, emphasizing the significance of an MMV approach that evolves throughout the project lifecycle to enhance the reliability of CCS monitoring programs.Despite the effectiveness, the existing integrated process-based framework and adaptive baseline MMV approach pose challenges, including labor intensity, surface detection limitations, and reliance on pre-existing data. Basin analysis at Aquistore has shown no significant preferential pathways between the storage site and the surface. However, risk assessments identified the most probable CO2 migration path along the injection and monitoring wells due to potential well integrity issues. To address these challenges, a partial shift to a risk-based monitoring approach is proposed in this paper, incorporating modern continuous sensor and algorithm systems to monitor high-risk areas continuously and non-invasively, with a proportional reduction in process-based sampling. These advanced systems, which were unavailable during the initial design of the Aquistore MMV program, provide a more targeted and maintainable solution by combining CO2 and CH4 sensors with Lagrangian back-trajectory algorithms to detect anomalies, minimizing false positives through geochemical ratios and spatial matching.Findings from Aquistore underscore the importance of adaptive and continuous baseline monitoring to avoid the pitfalls of misinterpretation, such as those seen in previous leak allegations at the Weyburn site. Ultimately, a well-conceived baseline MMV framework is less costly than responding to seepage allegations, reinforcing the importance of comprehensive MMV in successful CCS deployment.",碳捕集与封存（CCS）技术被公认为减少全球温室气体（尤其是二氧化碳）排放的关键技术，为实现低碳经济提供了可行路径。加拿大凭借多个运营项目及重大投资计划已成为该领域领导者，但公众接受度仍是持续挑战——这主要源于对二氧化碳封存安全性的担忧，如加拿大韦本地区克尔投诉事件所示，当时虚假泄漏指控引发了大规模调查。. . CCS项目的成功取决于健全的测量、监测与验证（MMV）体系的实施。其中地表土壤气体MMV通过对比注入前后的排放模式，在建立公众信任方面发挥关键作用，既能揭示自然变化规律，又能证明泄漏检测能力。位于加拿大萨斯喀彻温省的Aquistor项目是前沿CCS科研项目，其地表土壤气体MMV主要采用基于过程的指标监测体系，包括CO₂、氧气、氮气浓度及放射性碳同位素Δ¹⁴CO₂等参数。与其他项目不同，这些指标在注入前基线研究中已获全面测量，并实施每半年一次的注入后定期监测。. . 本文通过Aquistor案例，剖析了过程型MMV方法的优势与挑战，重点阐释了监测体系动态调适的重要性。自2012年以来，该项目地表土壤气体MMV方案通过自适应采样策略不断演进，在保障数据质量的同时降低了资源消耗。十年间积累的完整基线数据集（含注入前测量值）被证实对数据解读至关重要。尽管监测未发现CO₂注入导致的地表影响，但持续检出古老的Δ¹⁴CO₂值曾引发疑虑——初期这些特征疑似封存CO₂上涌，后续研究却揭示其源自历史露天煤矿遗留风化煤屑的微生物分解。若无全面动态的基线监测数据，这些发现可能被误判，凸显了MMV体系全周期演进对提升监测可靠性的价值。. . 现有过程型框架与自适应基线MMV方法虽成效显著，仍存在人力密集、地表探测局限及数据依赖性等挑战。Aquistor盆地分析显示封存层与地表间无显著优势通道，但风险评估指出井筒完整性隐患可能构成CO₂迁移路径。为此本文建议向风险导向型监测部分转型：在高风险区域部署现代连续传感器与算法系统进行非侵入式实时监测，相应减少过程型采样频次。这些技术（在项目设计初期尚未成熟）通过CO₂/CH₄传感器与拉格朗日反向轨迹算法联用，结合地球化学比值与空间匹配分析，可精准识别异常并降低误报率。. . Aquistor的实践印证了动态持续基线监测对避免误判的关键作用，韦本泄漏指控的教训由此得以规避。事实证明，完善的基线MMV框架成本远低于应对渗漏指控的代价，这再次验证了全面监测体系对CCS成功实施的决定性意义。,"CCS, MMV, Aquistore, Baseline monitoring, Continuous emission monitoring, Lagrangian back-trajectory algorithm",2025-01-06
risk control,CultureRisk: An Exploratory Study of the Influence of Culture on Auditors’ Evaluation of InternalControland Assessment ofControlRisk,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2583964,Wm. Dennis Huber,"Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS) require auditors to evaluate internal control and assess control risk when performing an audit. Among the factors to be considered are the control environment, control activities, management's attitude's toward internal control, and culture.  Research on how, or whether, culture influences auditors' evaluation of internal control and assessment of control risk is lacking in the literature. The purpose of this study is to serve as a first step in determining whether culture influences auditors' evaluation of internal control and assessment of control risk and if so, how. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on a non-random sample of 200 CPAs in the U.S. to determine whether there are differences in auditors' evaluation of internal control and assessment of control risk in different cultures. Using Hofstede's cultural dimensions (individualism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance and masculinity), the results of the study indicate that auditors evaluate internal control and assess control risk significantly different for companies that operate in countries that are on opposite ends of the cultural continuum as measured by Hofstede's dimensions. The results of the test suggest that for internal control there is a ""culture risk"" at work, that can be defined as the risk that an entity's internal control maybe be less (more) effective, with a higher (lower) degree of control risk, purely as a function of the culture in which the entity operates. Auditors assess control risk higher for companies operating in countries with a low individualism score, a high power distance score, and a low uncertainty avoidance score. They also evaluate total internal control as less effective in countries with a low individualism score, a high power distance score, a low masculinity score and a low uncertainty avoidance score.

risk control,Towards an Integrated Assessment of Global CatastrophicRisk,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3046816,Seth Baum,"Integrated assessment is an analysis of a topic that integrates multiple lines of research. Integrated assessments are thus inherently interdisciplinary.

Generally speaking, GCR is the risk of significant harm to global human civilization. More precise definitions are provided below. Some GCRs include nuclear war, climate change, and pandemic disease outbreaks. Integrated assessment of GCR puts all these risks into one study in order to address overarching questions about the risk and the opportunities to reduce it.

We find that the impact of parameter uncertainty on economic outcomes is much more pronounced away from optimality than along an optimal path. We also find that for this non-omniscient and politically constrained social planner the most desirable of the `feasible' courses of actions depends strongly on which quantity is known with uncertainty. A gradual ramp-up is preferred to a steep (`Stern-like') abatement schedule when we consider (symmetric) uncertainty in the growth rate of the economy, or in the cost of abatement. This result is extremely robust to the choice of a number of non-expected-utility-maximization decisional criteria that do not make use of probabilities: minimax, maximax and maximin all give the same recommendation. Ambiguity aversion does not change these results. However, when uncertainty in the damage function is considered, a steeper abatement schedule becomes a strong contender, and is preferred by some decisional criteria. This suggests that researching this aspect of climate modelling would have the greatest policy relevance. Finally, we note that a gradual (`Nordhaus-like') ramp-up of the abatement efforts abatement schedule is always preferred to a slower (`business-as-usual') schedule of abatement even in the case of much stronger future economic growth or much milder climate damage than the central estimates of the DICE model.","我们研究了一个非无限利他主义的社会规划者的情况，该规划者不了解DICE模型中真实的气候和经济参数，并且由于政治或社会约束无法采取最优行动。我们发现，参数不确定性对经济结果的影响在偏离最优路径时远比沿最优路径时更为显著。我们还发现，对于这个非全知且受政治约束的社会规划者而言，""可行""行动方案中最理想的选择在很大程度上取决于哪些量存在不确定性。当考虑经济增长率或减排成本的（对称）不确定性时，渐进式减排方案比陡峭的（""斯特恩式""）减排时间表更受青睐。这一结果对于多种不依赖概率的非期望效用最大化决策准则的选择具有极强的稳健性：极小化极大、极大化极大和极大化极小准则都给出了相同的建议。模糊厌恶也不会改变这些结论。然而，当考虑损害函数的不确定性时，更陡峭的减排方案成为强有力的竞争者，并被某些决策准则所偏好。这表明研究气候建模的这一方面将具有最大的政策相关性。最后我们注意到，即使未来经济增长远高于DICE模型的核心预测值或气候损害远低于预期，渐进式（""诺德豪斯式""）的减排努力时间表始终优于缓慢的（""一切照旧""）减排方案。","climate risk, decision theory",2021-12-22
risk control,Pick Your Poison: Responses to the Marketing and Sale of Flavored Tobacco Products,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1527592,Tobacco Control Legal Consortium,"Tobacco manufacturers have targeted youth for decades in the marketing of tobacco products.  Their continuation of such practices, despite the prohibition against youth marketing under the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (“MSA”) between state attorneys general and the five largest tobacco manufacturers, does not come as a surprise to many public health and tobacco control advocates.  Since the signing of the MSA, state attorneys general have investigated and prosecuted numerous violations.  Still, the brazen approach some manufacturers have taken to market candy and fruit-flavored tobacco products in a manner that targets youth is astounding.  This law synopsis explores legal approaches for addressing the marketing and sale of flavored tobacco products to youth.  Section I describes various types of flavored tobacco products and reviews current evidence that the marketing of these products, as well as the products themselves, target youth.  Internal tobacco industry documents provide some answers as to why manufacturers have developed these new products.  Section II introduces one possible legal approach, MSA enforcement.   Section III focuses on legislative initiatives, such as Food and Drug Administration oversight of tobacco products, and state legislative initiatives, with particular attention paid to the State of Maine’s law prohibiting the sale of flavored cigarettes, which took effect January 1, 2009.  The experiences involved in passing the Maine Law provide an initial model for public health law development in this area.  Section III concludes with recommendations for refining the Maine Law.  It should be noted that although the design and marketing of menthol tobacco products may also increase youth smoking rates, this synopsis focuses on the less traditional flavored cigarettes, including candy, fruit and alcohol-flavored tobacco products. Editor’s Note:  This publication was prepared in February 2009, prior to the June 2009 passage of the Family Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, giving the U.S. Food and Drug Administration comprehensive authority to regulate the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of tobacco products.  Under this Act, cigarettes that contain flavors other than tobacco or menthol may not be sold, distributed or manufactured in the U.S., effective September 22, 2009.",烟草制造商数十年来一直将青少年作为烟草产品的营销目标。尽管1998年各州总检察长与五大烟草制造商达成的《总和解协议》（MSA）禁止针对青少年的营销行为，但许多公共卫生和控烟倡导者对这些企业继续此类做法并不感到意外。自MSA签署以来，州总检察长已调查并起诉了多起违规案件。然而，某些制造商肆无忌惮地通过糖果和水果味烟草产品针对青少年进行营销的手段仍令人震惊。本法律概要探讨了解决向青少年营销和销售调味烟草产品的法律途径。第一部分描述了各类调味烟草产品，并回顾了当前证据，表明这些产品的营销手段及产品本身均以青少年为目标。烟草业内部文件为制造商开发这些新产品的原因提供了一些答案。第二部分介绍了MSA执法这一可能的法律途径。第三部分聚焦立法举措，包括美国食品药品监督管理局对烟草产品的监管及各州立法行动，其中特别关注缅因州自2009年1月1日起生效的禁止销售调味香烟法律。缅因州立法过程中的经验为该领域公共卫生法律的发展提供了初步范本。第三部分最后提出了完善缅因州法律的建议。需要说明的是，虽然薄荷味烟草产品的设计和营销也可能提高青少年吸烟率，但本概要主要关注非传统口味的香烟，包括糖果味、水果味和酒味烟草产品。编者注：本出版物完成于2009年2月，早于2009年6月通过的《家庭预防与烟草控制法》。该法案授权美国食品药品监督管理局全面监管烟草产品的生产、营销和销售。根据该法案，自2009年9月22日起，美国禁止销售、分销或生产含有烟草或薄荷以外口味的香烟。,"Tobacco, law, policy, public health, flavored cigarettes, smoking, tobacco, tobacco regulation, tobacco products, candy cigarettes",2009-12-27

However, this policy of nuclear deflection could inadvertently increase the risk of nuclear war and other violent conflict. This article conducts risk-risk tradeoff analysis to assess whether nuclear deflection results in a net increase or decrease in risk. Assuming nonnuclear deflection options are also used, nuclear deflection may only be needed for the largest and most imminent asteroid collisions. These are low-frequency, high-severity events. The effect of nuclear deflection on violent conflict risk is more ambiguous due to the complex and dynamic social factors at play. Indeed, it is not clear whether nuclear deflection would cause a net increase or decrease in violent conflict risk. Similarly, this article cannot reach a precise conclusion on the overall risk-risk tradeoff. The value of this article comes less from specific quantitative conclusions and more from providing an analytical framework and a better overall understanding of the policy decision. The article demonstrates the importance of integrated analysis of global risks and the policies to address them, as well as the challenge of quantitative evaluation of complex social processes such as violent conflict.",为防止灾难性小行星撞击地球，有人提议使用核爆炸装置使近地小行星偏离轨道。然而这种核偏转策略可能无意中增加核战争及其他暴力冲突的风险。本文通过风险权衡分析来评估核偏转技术究竟会带来净风险增加还是降低。假设同时采用非核偏转方案，核偏转技术可能仅需用于应对最巨大且最迫在眉睫的小行星撞击——这类事件具有低频高损特性。由于涉及复杂多变的社会因素，核偏转对暴力冲突风险的影响更为模糊，目前尚无法明确其会带来暴力冲突风险的净增加还是降低。同样，本文对整体风险权衡也无法得出精确结论。本文的价值更多在于提供分析框架和提升政策决策的全局认知，而非具体量化结论。研究揭示了全球风险及其应对政策进行综合分析的重要性，同时也展现了暴力冲突等复杂社会过程量化评估的挑战性。,"nuclear weapons, asteroids, risk-risk tradeoff",2019-06-13

At Aquistore, a CCS project in Canada, Δ14CO2 is incorporated into surface soil-gas geochemical MMV studies to demonstrate the absence of surface impacts from CO2 injection. However, some monitoring locations consistently show depleted Δ14CO2 values (usually indicative of fossil CO2) that predate CO2 injections, suggesting these anomalies are natural or linked to soil disturbances. This study investigates the origins of these anomalies. We first hypothesized that CO2 venting from coal seams underlying parts of the monitoring grid could explain the depleted values. A spatial correlation between depleted Δ14CO2 values, historic open-pit coal mines, and mine spoils supported this hypothesis. However, Δ14CO2 analysis from a nearby farm (control site) with intact coal seams but no mine spoils showed modern-age signatures (6.8 ± 16 ‰), ruling out the venting hypothesis. Next, we tested whether microbial decomposition of weathered coal fragments was responsible. A soil survey revealed a strong correlation between coal fragment concentrations (1.85–40.64% w/w) and Δ14CO2 anomalies. Laboratory incubation experiments further supported this hypothesis, showing that dry soils with weathered coal fragments produced proportionately depleted Δ14CO2 values, likely due to microbial activity. These findings underscore the need for a more nuanced and site-specific approach to CCS monitoring. In geochemically complex sites like Aquistore, relying solely on D14CO2 may be misleading, and alternative tracers should be considered to ensure accurate soil-gas anomaly interpretations.",CO2的放射性碳同位素（Δ14CO2）是研究土壤呼吸CO2及其来源的重要工具。在加拿大碳捕集与封存项目Aquistore中，Δ1414CO2被纳入表层土壤气体地球化学MMV研究，以证明CO2注入未对地表产生影响。然而，部分监测点持续显示早于CO2注入活动的Δ14CO2贫化值（通常指示化石来源CO2），表明这些异常属于自然现象或与土壤扰动有关。本研究旨在探究这些异常的成因。我们首先假设监测网格下方煤层释放的CO2可能导致贫化值，Δ14CO2贫化值与历史露天煤矿及矿渣的空间关联性支持了这一假设。但附近保留完整煤层且无矿渣的农场（对照点）检测显示现代碳特征（6.8±16‰），排除了煤层释气假说。随后我们检验了风化煤屑微生物分解的可能性。土壤调查发现煤屑含量（1.85-40.64%重量比）与Δ14CO2异常高度相关。实验室培养实验进一步证实该假说，含风化煤屑的干燥土壤因微生物活动产生了相应比例的Δ14CO2贫化值。这些发现表明CCS监测需采取更精细的场地特异性方法。在Aquistore等地球化学复杂场地，单独依赖Δ14CO2可能产生误导，应考虑辅助示踪剂以确保土壤气体异常解释的准确性。,"Aquistore, Δ14CO2, ccs, Surface soil-gas monitoring, MMV, Coal mine spoils",2024-12-06
risk control,OperationalRiskManagement: Preventive vs. CorrectiveControl,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3088729,Yuqian Xu,"In this paper, we propose a general modeling framework for operational risk management of financial firms. We consider operational risk events as shocks to a financial firm's value process, and then study capital investments in preventive and corrective controls to mitigate risk losses. The optimal decisions would be made under three scenarios: (i) preventive control only, (ii) corrective control only, and (iii) joint controls. We characterize the optimal control policies under a general modeling framework under these three scenarios, and then discuss an exponential risk reduction function. We conclude our work with an implementation of our model to a data set from a commercial bank. We find that through a proper investment strategy, we can achieve a significant performance improvement, especially when the risk severity level is high. At the bank we analyze, we find that within a certain range of the frequency reduction efficiency we can achieve up to 2.5% improvement in the expected bank revenue; within a proper range of risk severity reduction efficiency, we can achieve an improvement of up to 1.5%.

While these models have received a lot of attention, empirical studies tailored to testing their core prediction are lacking. Using two prominent models, we derive precise hypotheses for choices between risky monetary payoffs in a state of low self-control, compared to regular self-control; in particular, lower levels of self-control should induce stronger risk aversion for stakes within a particular range.We test the hypotheses in a lab experiment with a large number of subjects (N = 308), using a well-established self-control depletion task and measuring risk attitudes via finely graduated choice lists.

Our empirical results show that adverse internal control opinions reduces the likelihood of auditors being implicated in lawsuits against their clients, which suggests that disclosing internal control weaknesses can protect auditors from litigation. Consistent with the notion that such litigation protection in turn encourages auditors to issue adverse internal control opinions, we find that both new and incumbent auditors are more likely to issue adverse internal control opinions for clients with higher ex ante litigation risk. Moreover, for restating firms that eventually acknowledge the existence of internal control weaknesses, ex ante litigation risk is positively associated with earlier adverse internal control opinions. Overall, our evidence suggests that litigation threat provides an incentive rather than a disincentive for auditors to issue adverse internal control opinions in a timely fashion. As both new and incumbent auditors have such incentives, auditors’ litigation concerns suppress clients’ opportunistic internal control opinion shopping.",与研究表明私人诉讼会抑制审计客户披露内部控制缺陷不同，我们发现审计师的诉讼担忧会产生抵消效应。实证结果表明，不利的内部控制意见能降低审计师被卷入客户诉讼的概率，这表明披露内部控制缺陷可以保护审计师免受诉讼。与此观点一致的是，这种诉讼保护反过来会促使审计师更倾向于出具不利的内部控制意见——我们发现无论是新任还是现任审计师，对于事前诉讼风险较高的客户都更可能出具此类意见。此外，对于最终承认存在内部控制缺陷的重述企业，事前诉讼风险与早期不利内部控制意见呈正相关。总体而言，我们的证据表明诉讼威胁会激励而非阻碍审计师及时出具不利的内部控制意见。由于新任和现任审计师均存在这种动机，审计师的诉讼关切有效抑制了客户机会主义地挑选内部控制意见的行为。,"Auditor litigation risk, Internal control weaknesses",2019-07-10

Building on the above, SOX Act Section 404 requires thatmanagement should report information in its annual reports regarding the adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal controls, which affects the procedures of financial reporting. These internal control reports, as part of the internal audit system within an organization, they undergo a review initially by the internal audit department and then by external auditors. The external auditors’ comments may dictate certain changes to be made, which could inevitably lead to refinements, which are then depicted to the adjusted internal control reports. The need for restatements of internal control reports is definitely associated with additional workfrom the side of the external auditor and may initiate more extensive audit work. Hence, the aim of the particular study is to investigate to what extent the audit fees paid to external auditors(i.e. the audit firm) are affected by such restatements to the internal control reports and whether the entity’s earnings and book value of equity have a mediating role to the above relationship. The innovativeness of the current research lies at the fact that it is the first time that a research focuses on “Restatements of Internal Control Reports” (RICR) and “Firm’s Earnings” (FE) as significant determinants of “Audit Fees” (AF) paid to external auditors, providing materially useful evidence about the behavioral profile of audit firms concerning their pricing strategy.

In view of this background, this study constructed the SIs-EIeRS model of counterparty credit risk contagion caused by major emergencies on the basis of complex network theory and the infectious disease model. This research also analyzed the mechanism and evolution characteristics of counterparty credit risk contagion through theoretical deduction and computational simulation. On this basis, we combined the Mansfield diffusion model and nonlinear system dynamics theory, constructed the counterparty credit risk contagion control model under the impact of major emergencies, and analyzed the evolution characteristics and optimal control strategy selection of counterparty credit risk contagion control under major emergencies through theoretical deduction and computational simulation. The results showed the following. 1) When the recombination rate of bankrupt credit subjects is small, the default rate of the normal credit subject without the impact of major emergencies and the impact strength of major emergencies is small. Furthermore, the counterparty credit risk contagion scale decreases with the increase of the impact strength of major emergencies. However, in other cases, the counterparty credit risk contagion scale increases with the impact strength of major emergencies. 2) Under the differential influence of major emergencies on the default rate, bankruptcy rate, and recovery rate of the affected credit subjects, the evolution of the counterparty credit risk contagion scale tends to increase or decrease first and then increase with the increase of the impact strength of major emergencies. 3) Under the four types of control strategies, namely, pre-prevention control, blocking control, lagging recovery control, and comprehensive control, the counterparty credit risk contagion scale increases first and then decreases to the stable target value. However, the stable control level of counterparty credit risk contagion is different. 4) Considering the effect of counterparty credit risk contagion control and social resource consumption comprehensively, both lagging recovery control strategy and comprehensive control strategy may be the optimal strategies, and different optimal strategies may be selected with the change of contagion conditions under the impact of major emergencies.",重大突发事件频发引发金融市场交易对手信用违约及其传染，对重大突发事件冲击下交易对手信用风险传染控制研究具有重要意义。鉴于此背景，本研究基于复杂网络理论和传染病模型构建了重大突发事件引发交易对手信用风险传染的SIs-EIeRS模型，通过理论推导和计算仿真分析了交易对手信用风险传染机理及演化特征。在此基础上，结合Mansfield扩散模型和非线性系统动力学理论，构建了重大突发事件冲击下交易对手信用风险传染控制模型，通过理论推导和计算仿真分析了重大突发事件下交易对手信用风险传染控制的演化特征及最优控制策略选择。研究结果表明：1）当破产信用主体重组率较小，且未受重大突发事件冲击的正常信用主体违约率与重大突发事件冲击强度较小时，交易对手信用风险传染规模随重大突发事件冲击强度增大而减小；其余情形下交易对手信用风险传染规模随重大突发事件冲击强度增大而增大。2）在重大突发事件对受冲击信用主体违约率、破产率及恢复率差异化影响下，交易对手信用风险传染规模演化趋势随重大突发事件冲击强度增大呈现先减小后增大或持续增大的特征。3）在预先防范控制、阻断控制、滞后恢复控制及综合控制四类策略下，交易对手信用风险传染规模均先增大后减小至稳定目标值，但交易对手信用风险传染的稳定控制水平存在差异。4）综合考虑交易对手信用风险传染控制效果与社会资源消耗，滞后恢复控制策略与综合控制策略均可能成为最优策略，且随重大突发事件冲击下传染条件变化可能选择不同最优策略。,"risk management, Counterparty credit risk, Major emergency, Evolution control, Optimal policy selection",2023-04-04

risk control,Seven Questions for ExistentialRiskStudies,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4118618,Lalitha Sundaram,"Recent years have seen the emergence of Existential Risk Studies (ERS), a rich field focused on understanding and mitigating a range of Extreme Technological Risks. This interdisciplinary and idiosyncratic field today finds itself at a crossroads: at the same time as many risks are growing increasingly urgent, there is increasing attention and potential to shape global action in response. The magnitude of both risks and opportunities create an urgent need for this field to reflect on how it defines itself going forward–as a community, as a science, and as a project pursuing change.Drawing on work from across the ERS field and beyond, as well as the authors' personal experiences, this article seeks to spur and aid this process of reflection. To that end, we pose and discuss seven key questions for the ERS field. These are: (1) how can scholars of ERS choose which risks to prioritize? (2) How or why can we prioritize extreme technological risk over other global problems, and what are the possible downsides of ERS? (3) What are the different possible approaches to studying and managing ETRs? (4) In what ways can the field of ERS pursue a coherent scientific approach? (5) How can or should ERS pursue impact to mitigate ETRs? (6) How diverse is the field of ERS, and how can greater diversity aid the ERS field? (7) How can ERS best reflect on -and communicate about these questions, as it continues to grow?We do not provide definitive answers, but attempt to explore how and why different people might respond in different ways. We point to open debates around: disciplinary direction, pluralism, epistemic modesty, diversity, inclusion, representation and accountability. We take these challenges to be not just important but increasingly urgent, as pivotal considerations in charting a path forward for our field–and, perhaps, our world.",近年来，生存风险研究（ERS）这一新兴领域逐渐兴起，它致力于理解和缓解一系列极端技术风险，成为一个内涵丰富的学科。这个跨学科且独具特色的领域如今正处在十字路口：一方面许多风险日益紧迫，另一方面全球应对行动的关注度与塑造潜力也在提升。风险与机遇的双重重要性迫切要求该领域从社群构成、科学定位到变革实践等维度重新审视自身发展方向。本文结合ERS领域内外研究成果及作者个人经验，旨在推动并辅助这一反思进程。为此我们提出并探讨了ERS领域的七个核心问题：（1）学者如何选择优先研究的风险类型？（2）为何应将极端技术风险置于其他全球问题之上？ERS可能存在哪些弊端？（3）研究与管理极端技术风险有哪些不同路径？（4）ERS领域如何建立连贯的科学方法论？（5）ERS应通过何种方式实现风险缓解的影响力？（6）该领域多样性现状如何？提升多样性有何裨益？（7）随着领域发展，ERS应如何有效反思并传播这些问题的探讨？. . 我们并未提供确定性答案，而是试图探究不同群体可能作出差异化回应的原因及方式。文中指出了若干开放性争议：学科方向、多元主义、认知谦逊、多样性、包容性、代表性与问责制。我们认为这些挑战不仅至关重要且日益紧迫，它们或将决定本领域——甚或整个人类社会——的未来发展轨迹。,"Existential risk, existential risk studies, global catastrophic risk, epistemology, methodology, theory of change",2022-06-07

Current parasiticide use is possibly impacting the environment, increasing adverse reaction and resistance risk. As such parasiticides should be dispensed by the veterinary team proportional to individual risk, including owners in their approach. A mixed-methods questionnaire was designed and distributed using snowball sampling to ascertain overall understanding, observance, and attitude towards utilising a risk-based approach to parasite prophylaxis by UK companion animal veterinarians. 85.71% of veterinarians surveyed reported that they broadly understood risk-based parasite control whereas only 53.92% said they utilise it always or often. Significant correlations were found between more frequent risk-based parasite control utilisation and increased owner involvement (p<= 0.0007) and prescription confidence (p= 0.0001). Most attitudes towards adopting risk-based control were positive. There was significant association with positive attitude and greater utilisation frequency (p= 0.0010), as well as working in corporate practice (p= 0.0126). Understanding risk-based parasite control has potential to increase responsible utilisation of parasiticides by veterinarians, and therefore mitigate risks associated. Most veterinarians would like to see the profession move towards risk-based control use, but institutional changes are required. Further research, and education is also needed.",寄生虫可能对伴侣动物及其主人构成威胁。当前驱虫药的使用可能正在影响环境，增加不良反应和耐药性风险。因此，兽医团队应根据个体风险（包括主人因素）按比例分配驱虫药。本研究采用混合方法问卷设计，通过滚雪球抽样分发，以评估英国伴侣动物兽医对基于风险的寄生虫预防方法的整体理解、实践情况及态度。85.71%的受访兽医表示基本理解基于风险的寄生虫防控，但仅53.92%表示总是或经常采用该方法。研究发现，更频繁采用基于风险防控与加强主人参与度（p≤0.0007）及处方信心（p=0.0001）存在显著相关性。多数兽医对采用该防控方法持积极态度，积极态度与更高使用频率（p=0.0010）及在连锁诊所工作（p=0.0126）显著相关。理解基于风险的防控有望促进兽医更负责任地使用驱虫药，从而降低相关风险。多数兽医希望行业转向基于风险的防控，但需进行制度性变革，同时需要进一步研究和教育支持。,"Companion animals, risk-based, evidence-based, parasiticides, parasite control",2022-04-13
risk control,"ExcessControlRights, Financial Crisis and Bank Profitability andRisk",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2311738,Amine Tarazi,"We empirically investigate the impact of shareholders' excess control rights (greater control than cash-flow rights) on bank profitability and risk before, during, and after the global financial crisis of 2007-2008. We use a unique hand-crafted dataset tracing the complete control chains of 788 European commercial banks and cover the 2002-2010 period. We find that the presence of excess control rights is associated with lower profitability, higher risk-taking and higher default risk before (2002-2006) and after (2009-2010) the crisis. Conversely, it improves profitability and no longer affects risk during the crisis (2007-2008). Further evidence shows that, regardless of the period, the effect of excess control rights on profitability and risk is accentuated in family-controlled banks and in countries with relatively weak shareholder protection rights and that such an effect is only effective at intermediate and high levels of excess control rights. Overall, our findings contribute to the literature examining the corporate governance determinants of banks' performance during the 2007-2008 financial crisis and have several policy implications.",我们实证研究了2007-2008年全球金融危机前、中、后时期股东超额控制权（控制权大于现金流权）对银行盈利能力和风险的影响。通过手工构建的独特数据集，我们追踪了788家欧洲商业银行的完整控制链，涵盖2002-2010年期间。研究发现，在危机前（2002-2006）和危机后（2009-2010），超额控制权的存在与较低盈利能力、较高风险承担及较高违约风险相关；而在危机期间（2007-2008），超额控制权反而提升盈利能力且不再影响风险。进一步证据表明，无论处于哪个时期，超额控制权对盈利能力和风险的影响在家族控股银行及股东保护较弱的国家更为显著，且这种效应仅在中高等超额控制权水平下有效。总体而言，我们的发现为研究2007-2008年金融危机期间银行绩效的公司治理决定因素提供了文献贡献，并具有多重政策启示。,"excess control rights, pyramids, financial crisis, profitability, risk, European banking",2013-08-19

In this study, we examine risk preferences and self-control behaviors of young children from Syria as they were exposed to the Syrian war. We measure children’s risk preferences and self-control ability using incentivized games. To discern the effect of the war from other confounding effects, we compare children born in Syria and exposed to the war with children living in the Turkish side of the border and not exposed to the war. We find that conflict affects behavior. After controlling for demographics and cognitive ability, children exposed to the war take more risks.

It has long been considered the “grand dream” or “holy grail” of AI. It also poses major issues of ethics, risk, and policy due to its potential to transform society: if AGI is built, it could either help solve the world’s problems or cause major catastrophe, possibly even human extinction. This paper presents the first-ever survey of active AGI R&D projects in terms of ethics, risk, and policy. A thorough search identifies 45 projects of diverse sizes, nationalities, ethical goals, and other attributes. Most projects are either academic or corporate. The academic projects tend to express goals of advancing knowledge and are less likely to be active on AGI safety issues. The corporate projects tend to express goals of benefiting humanity and are more likely to be active on safety. Most projects are based in the US, and almost all are in either the US or a US ally, including all of the larger projects. This geographic concentration could simplify policymaking, though most projects publish open-source code, enabling contributions from anywhere in the world. These and other findings of the survey offer an empirical basis for the study of AGI R&D and a guide for policy and other action.","通用人工智能（AGI）是一种能在广泛领域进行推理的AI技术，长期以来被视为AI领域的""终极梦想""或""圣杯""。由于其变革社会的潜力，AGI也引发了伦理、风险和政策方面的重大议题：若成功研发，它既能助力解决全球性问题，也可能引发重大灾难甚至导致人类灭绝。本文首次针对活跃的AGI研发项目开展了伦理、风险及政策维度的调查研究。通过全面检索共识别出45个规模、国籍、伦理目标各异的项目，其中多数属于学术机构或企业。学术项目多以推动知识进步为目标，较少关注AGI安全性问题；企业项目则更强调造福人类，且更注重安全研发。大多数项目位于美国，几乎所有项目都集中在美国或其盟国境内（包括全部大型项目）。这种地域集中性可能简化政策制定流程，不过多数项目开源代码的特性允许全球各地参与贡献。这些调查结果为AGI研发研究提供了实证基础，也为政策制定等行动提供了指引依据。","artificial intelligence, ethics, risk, policy",2017-11-16

We provide an explicit gradient descent-ascent algorithm which applies to problems subject to non-linear stochastic differential equations. More specifically, we leverage duality properties of coherent risk measures to relax the problem via a smooth min-max reformulation which induces artificial strong concavity in the max subproblem. We then formulate necessary conditions of optimality for this relaxed problem which we leverage to prove convergence of the gradient descent-ascent algorithm to candidate solutions of the original problem.

Gaspar,"There has been increasing support in the empirical literature that both the probability of default (PD) and the loss given default (LGD) are correlated and driven by macroeconomic variables. Paradoxically, there has been very little effort from the theoretical literature to develop credit risk models that would include this possibility. The goals of this paper are: first, to develop the theoretical reduced-form framework needed to handle stochastic correlation of recovery and intensity, proposing a new class of models; second, to understand under what conditions would our class of models reflect empirically observed features and, finally, to use concrete model from our class to study the impact of this correlation in credit risk term structures.  We show that, in our class of models, it is possible to model directly empirically observed features. For instance, we can define default intensity and losses given default to be higher during economic depression periods - the well-know credit risk business cycle effect. Using the concrete model we show that in reduced-form models different assumptions - concerning default intensities, distribution of losses given default, and specifically their correlation - have a significant impact on the shape of credit spread term structures, and consequently on pricing of credit products as well as credit risk assessment in general. Finally, we propose a way to calibrate this class of models to market data, and illustrate the technique using our concrete example using US market data on corporate yields.",实证文献中越来越多的证据表明，违约概率（PD）与违约损失率（LGD）存在相关性，且两者均受宏观经济变量驱动。然而矛盾的是，理论文献却鲜少尝试构建包含这种可能性的信用风险模型。本文目标有三：首先，建立处理回收率与违约强度随机相关性的理论简化形式框架，提出新模型类别；其次，探究该模型类在何种条件下能反映实证观察到的特征；最后，通过具体模型研究这种相关性对信用风险期限结构的影响。我们证明，该模型类可直接刻画实证观察到的特征。例如，能定义经济萧条时期更高的违约强度与违约损失率——即众所周知的信用风险经济周期效应。通过具体模型展示：在简化形式模型中，关于违约强度、违约损失率分布及其相关性的不同假设，会显著影响信用利差期限结构的形态，进而影响信用产品定价及整体信用风险评估。最后，我们提出基于市场数据校准此类模型的方法，并运用美国公司债券收益率市场数据进行实例演示。,"Credit risk, sistematic risk, intensity models, recovery, credit spreads",2006-07-17
risk control,Regulatory Capital and AssetRiskTransfer,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4221205,Kyeonghee Kim,"We explore whether life insurers use a unique reinsurance arrangement to manage assets tied to their regulatory capital. Typical reinsurance allows insurers to reduce their regulatory capital by transferring liabilities (reserves), and the associated assets, to reinsurers. With modified coinsurance, insurers maintain control of their assets and liabilities while transferring regulatory capital requirements to the reinsurer. Holding fixed an insurer’s reported capital, we find that modified coinsurance allows insurers to report higher risk-based capital ratios. Insurers with modified coinsurance are less likely to fire sale downgraded bonds. We also find suggestive evidence of regulatory arbitrage, as most modified coinsurance is purchased from reinsurers in countries with low capital requirements or within the same insurance group.",我们探讨寿险公司是否利用一种独特的再保险安排来管理与其监管资本相关的资产。传统再保险允许保险公司通过将负债（准备金）及相关资产转移给再保险人来降低监管资本要求。而在修正共保模式下，保险公司在将监管资本要求转移给再保险人的同时，仍保留对自身资产和负债的控制权。在保持保险公司账面资本不变的情况下，我们发现修正共保能使保险公司报告更高的风险资本比率。采用修正共保的保险公司更少出现降级债券抛售现象。我们还发现监管套利的迹象——大多数修正共保交易要么来自资本要求较低国家的再保险人，要么发生在同一保险集团内部。,"corporate bonds, life insurance, modified coinsurance, reinsurance, risk-based capital",2022-09-27

This finding is consistent with Aebi et al.’s (2012) study on risk management and bank performance. These results underscore the crucial role of robust risk governance in banking, suggesting that enhanced governance practices can significantly mitigate risks. The study contributes to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence supporting the quantification of risk through governance mechanisms, aligning with, and enriching current theoretical frameworks. While highlighting the importance of these findings, the study also acknowledges its limitations, such as potential endogeneity issues, and suggests directions for future research to expand the understanding of risk governance’s impact on bank behavior, including the exploration of additional variables and the integration of qualitative methodologies.

The article underscored the need to advance the focus of its execution beyond ex-post reactive penalization of respective firms for compromise of privacy of personal information by firms 'storing' such data to focus on ex-ante Sustainability and Survival material to individuals. There were two specific issues underlying the above recommendations. First, it is not just about storage of such 'entrusted' data but if and how such data was 'exploited' by the trusted firms to Command & Control the Survival and Sustainability of respective individuals. Second, in most cases, those firms may not even be responsible for such compromise of individual data entrusted to them given that they are themselves subject to being 'hacked' by third parties. Hence, to solve the more critical systemic problem encompassing all individuals and firms, we need to build and stress-test systems to preempt and prevent such 'hacking' attacks in addition to the proposed normative compliance measures. Essentially, for Sustainability and Survival of individual Command & Control (C2), we need to focus on developing and deploying Adversarial C2 systems to stress test the robustness of C2 systems as well as Counter-Adversarial C2 to counter the adversarial threats.The specific focus of global networked systems, infrastructures, and networks that can get impacted in global systemic exponential cascading attacks given the inter-connectivity of networks and often endogenous nature of such attacks was compared with analogous global contagion risks of COVID-19 and their global and national 'spread' that all are monitoring. Over the subsequent few weeks, the COVID-19 global pandemic had unfolded with major adverse impacts evident across public health, global financial and economic, and, global geopolitical, national defense and security, and, related socioeconomic domains. The Survival & Sustainability of Systems at all levels which is at stake and the respective critical significance of Command & Controls - spanning global, national, organizational, individual, and, even human cellular levels of analysis – are being recognized worldwide as never before on the COVID-19 pandemic threats and vulnerabilities ""global theater"". The respective role of such Command & Controls that are the most essential defining attributes of all Self-Adaptive Systems and their self-identity, self-regulation, and, self-determination are also being recognized in terms of determining the Sustainability and Survival of the respective Systems at all levels.

risk control,The Power of PersonalControlin Financial Decisions UnderRisk,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4762932,Danielle Kent,"This study provides evidence from a randomized controlled incentivized experiment, and the field, that people make riskier financial decisions after experiencing helplessness. Analysis of field data suggests greater gambling expenditure after a loss of personal control as captured in large-scale longitudinal surveys. I propose a new model that builds on prospect theory to incorporate biological mechanisms that explain the power of personal control in decisions under risk. The model does not require a probability weighting function and has the advantage of being cardinal, continuous and bounded, making it highly adaptable and generally applicable. I test the model using an incentivized experiment involving 273 subjects. Inducing helplessness with a validated induction causes significantly higher risky investment compared to the control group. Results are robust controlling for baseline risk preferences, wealth effects, bounded rationality and gender. Both experimental and field data verifies that a loss of personal control is a powerful determinant of financial decisions under risk.",这项研究通过随机对照激励实验和实地数据证明，人们在经历无助感后会做出风险更高的财务决策。对实地数据的分析表明，大规模纵向调查显示，在丧失个人控制力后，人们的赌博支出会增加。我提出了一个基于前景理论的新模型，该模型结合了生物学机制，用以解释个人控制在风险决策中的影响力。该模型无需概率加权函数，并具有基数性、连续性和有界性的优势，使其具备高度适应性和普适性。我通过一项涉及273名受试者的激励实验对该模型进行了验证。采用已验证的诱导方法引发无助感后，实验组相比对照组表现出显著更高的风险投资倾向。研究结果在控制基线风险偏好、财富效应、有限理性和性别因素后依然稳健。实验与实地数据均证实，个人控制力的丧失是风险情境下财务决策的重要决定因素。,"risk, personal finance, personal control, learned helplessness, experience effects, behavioral finance",2024-03-21
risk control,"InternalControlEffectiveness, TextualRiskDisclosure, and Their Usefulness: U.S. Evidence",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4056701,Mohamed Elsayed,"This paper investigates the impact of internal control effectiveness (ICE) on the level of textual risk disclosure (TRD; including aggregate risk disclosure and its tone of good news and bad news about risk). Our findings suggest that firms with an ineffective internal control system exhibit significantly lower levels of TRD than firms with effective internal controls. Besides, we show a significant change in TRD behavior provided by managers of firms with recurrent ineffective internal controls. Pursuant to agency theory, this behavior change is prompted to reduce the expected public uncertainty and agency problems. We also investigate the usefulness of ICE reporting and TRD to the market. Results suggest that firms reporting ineffective internal controls are likely to have higher investor-perceived risk than firms reporting effective internal controls. Furthermore, TRD improves firms’ market liquidity, and such improvement is principally driven by good news rather than bad news about risk. Collectively, our results fill an apparent gap in the literature on the importance of ICE, as well as the usefulness of the external auditor’s attestation on a firm’s internal controls and management TRD.",本文研究了内部控制有效性（ICE）对文本风险披露水平（TRD，包括总体风险披露及其关于风险的好消息和坏消息语气）的影响。研究发现，与内部控制有效的企业相比，内部控制无效企业的TRD水平显著较低。此外，我们发现内部控制反复无效的企业管理层会显著改变其TRD行为。根据代理理论，这种行为改变旨在降低预期的公众不确定性和代理问题。我们还探讨了ICE报告和TRD对市场的实用性。结果表明，与报告内部控制有效的企业相比，报告内部控制无效的企业可能面临更高的投资者感知风险。此外，TRD能提升企业的市场流动性，且这种改善主要源于关于风险的好消息而非坏消息。总体而言，我们的研究填补了现有文献关于ICE重要性、外部审计师对企业内部控制的鉴证作用以及管理层TRD实用性的明显空白。,"SOX, Internal control, textual risk disclosure, risk-related tones, market liquidity, investor-perceived risk",2022-04-18

Offshore outsourcing of accounting presents some unique risks, control problems and challenges. In this paper we focus on the control of relational risk, a form of risk concerned with the potential for an outsourcing partner's opportunistic behaviour. Drawing on multiple case studies of global outsourcing relationships involving India based vendors and clients in UK, this paper identifies relational risks and the controls adopted by vendors and clients. It is argued that the findings have more general implications for the management of offshore outsourcing of administrative functions.",美国和西欧的许多公司正利用信息技术的发展，将部分会计流程外包给世界其他地区的供应商。会计离岸外包带来了一些独特的风险、控制问题和挑战。本文重点关注关系风险的控制，这类风险涉及外包合作伙伴机会主义行为的潜在可能。通过研究以印度供应商和英国客户为主的全球外包关系多案例，本文识别了关系风险及供需双方采取的控制措施。研究结果对行政职能离岸外包管理具有更广泛的启示意义。,"Outsourcing, Risk, Control, India",2010-01-10
risk control,"Adaptive Firm Structure under Market Competition: Efficiency, Incentives, andRiskControl",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2605298,Tiangle Song,"This paper presents a theory on how firm structure responds to market competitiveness. Firms have often been observed to reallocate control rights, sometimes in response to market competition. We develop a theory on the dependence of firm structure on market competition using an incomplete contract approach. We show that a reallocation of control rights can be an effective way of adapting to changing market competitiveness. We find that when market competitiveness changes, depending on demand elasticity, firms may centralize or decentralize control rights to encourage work incentives or to control risk. We present a few case studies in support of this result. We also investigate the effect of changing demand elasticity and production cost on firm structure, as well as the effect of market competition on efficiency, incentives and risk control after taking into account the endogenous, competition-driven firm structure.",本文提出了一种关于企业结构如何响应市场竞争力的理论。我们经常观察到企业会重新分配控制权，有时是为了应对市场竞争。我们运用不完全契约方法，构建了一个关于企业结构依赖于市场竞争的理论。研究表明，控制权的重新分配可以成为适应市场竞争环境变化的有效方式。我们发现当市场竞争力发生变化时，根据需求弹性差异，企业可能通过集权或分权来激励工作积极性或控制风险。文中提供了若干支持这一结论的案例研究。我们还探讨了需求弹性和生产成本变化对企业结构的影响，以及在考虑内生性、竞争驱动的企业结构后，市场竞争对效率、激励和风险控制的作用。,"adaptive firm structure, market competition, incomplete contract, control rights, income rights, efficiency, incentives, risk control",2015-05-12

It is urgent to conduct research on security integration risk assessment of the system.This article first systematically analyzes and judges the typical international and national standards for ICS safety, security, and security integration;Then, based on this, the key issues of the risk assessment method for industrial control system security integration were analyzed and identified: definition of security integration risk, analysis of risk propagation path, calculation of risk propagation path possibility, and quantification of security event loss value. Among them, risk definition is the foundation;Then, a comprehensive and systematic review of the research status of these four key issues was conducted,and further summarized and elevated;Finally,the current research challenges and future development directions of integrated security risk assessment were discussed.",随着工业化与信息化的深度融合，工业控制系统(Industrial Control Systems，ICS)在提升效率的同时也面临更多新的威胁与风险，安全问题影响系统安全。风险评估是安全防护体系的重要组成部分，因此开展工业控制系统安全风险评估研究至关重要。由于安全风险与安防风险之间存在相互影响，仅对系统进行安全风险评估或安防风险评估已不足以满足新形势需求，亟需开展系统安防一体化风险评估研究。本文首先对国际国内典型的ICS安全、安防及安防一体化标准进行了系统分析与研判;然后在此基础上分析并识别出工业控制系统安防一体化风险评估方法的关键问题:安防一体化风险定义、风险传播路径分析、风险传播路径可能性计算及安防事件损失值量化。其中，风险定义是基础;然后对这四个关键问题的研究现状进行了全面系统的梳理，并进一步总结与提升;最后探讨了安防一体化风险评估当前的研究难点与未来的发展方向。,"Industrial Control System Security, Security Risk Assessment, Safety Risk Assessment, Risk propagation path, Security incident losses",2024-09-25
risk control,On the CreditRiskof Secured Loans with Maximum Loan-to-Value Covenants,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1950193,Fabian Astic,"We propose a framework for analyzing the credit risk of secured loans under historical probability. We assume that the collateral cannot be liquidated immediately. Closed-form solutions for the expected loss are obtained for non-revolving loans. In the revolving case, we introduce a minimization problem with a loss function parameterized by a risk reluctance coefficient. We use stochastic control techniques to derive the Partial Integro-Differential Equation satisfied by the value function, and solve it numerically with a finite difference scheme. We exhibit optimal strategies and compare them with the standard LTV-based lending policy.",我们提出一个在历史概率下分析担保贷款信用风险的框架。假设抵押物无法立即变现。针对非循环贷款，我们获得了预期损失的闭式解。对于循环贷款情形，我们引入了一个由风险厌恶系数参数化的损失函数最小化问题。运用随机控制技术，推导出价值函数满足的偏积分微分方程，并采用有限差分法进行数值求解。我们展示了最优策略，并将其与基于贷款价值比的标准放贷政策进行比较。,"Credit risk, secured loans, illiquid asset, optimal stochastic control, HJB equation",2011-10-27
risk control,Internal AuditRiskManagement in Metropolitan Municipalities,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2815237,Christo Ackermann,"Internal audit functions (IAFs) of organisations are regarded as crucial components of the combined assurance model, alongside the audit committee, management and external auditors. The combined assurance model aims at having integrated and aligned assurance in organisations with the overall aim of maximising risk and governance oversight and control efficiencies. In this regard, internal audit plays a crucial role, insofar as it consists of experts in risk, governance and control consultancy who provide assurance to senior management and the audit committee. Audit committees are dependent on internal audit for information and their effectiveness revolves around a strong and well-resourced internal audit function which is able to aid audit committees to meet their oversight responsibilities. There is thus a growing demand for managing risk through the process of risk management and internal audit is in a perfect position to assist with the improvement of such processes. If internal auditors wish to continue being an important aspect of the combined assurance model, they need to address the critical area, amongst others, of risk management as part of their work. If not, it follows that the board, audit committees and other levels of management will remain uninformed on the status of these matters which, in turn, will negatively impact the ability of these stakeholders to discharge their responsibilities. This study therefore focuses on analysing the functioning of IAFs, with specific reference to their risk management mandate. The study followed a mixed method approach to describe internal audits risk management functioning in the big eight metropolitan municipalities in South Africa. The results show that internal audit provide a broad scope of risk management work which assist senior management in the discharge of their responsibilities. However, in the public eye, internal audits risk management functioning is scant.",组织的内部审计职能（IAFs）被视为联合保证模式中的关键组成部分，与审计委员会、管理层及外部审计机构并列。联合保证模式旨在通过整合与协调各方的保证工作，最大化组织的风险与治理监督及控制效率。在此框架下，内部审计发挥着核心作用——其由风险、治理及控制咨询领域的专家组成，为高级管理层和审计委员会提供保证服务。审计委员会依赖内部审计获取信息，其效能的发挥离不开一个资源充足、能力强劲的内部审计职能，后者能协助审计委员会履行监督职责。因此，通过风险管理流程管控风险的需求日益增长，而内部审计恰好能协助优化此类流程。若内部审计师希望持续成为联合保证模式的重要支柱，就必须将风险管理等关键领域纳入工作范畴。否则，董事会、审计委员会及其他管理层级将无法掌握这些事项的动态，进而削弱相关方履行职责的能力。本研究着重分析内部审计职能的运行机制，尤其关注其风险管理职责。研究采用混合方法，描述了南非八大都市市政当局内部审计的风险管理运作情况。结果显示，内部审计提供了广泛的风险管理工作，有效支持高级管理层履职。然而在公众视野中，内部审计的风险管理职能仍显不足。,Internal Audit; Risk Management; Public Sector; Municipalities; South Africa; Mixed Methods,2016-07-28

The article underscored the need to advance the focus of its execution beyond ex-post reactive penalization of respective firms for compromise of privacy of personal information by firms 'storing' such data to focus on ex-ante Sustainability and Survival material to individuals. There were two specific issues underlying the above recommendations. First, it is not just about storage of such 'entrusted' data but if and how such data was 'exploited' by the trusted firms to Command & Control the Survival and Sustainability of respective individuals. Second, in most cases, those firms may not even be responsible for such compromise of individual data entrusted to them given that they are themselves subject to being 'hacked' by third parties. Hence, to solve the more critical systemic problem encompassing all individuals and firms, we need to build and stress-test systems to preempt and prevent such 'hacking' attacks in addition to the proposed normative compliance measures. Essentially, for Sustainability and Survival of individual Command & Control (C2), we need to focus on developing and deploying Adversarial C2 systems to stress test the robustness of C2 systems as well as Counter-Adversarial C2 to counter the adversarial threats.The specific focus of global networked systems, infrastructures, and networks that can get impacted in global systemic exponential cascading attacks given the inter-connectivity of networks and often endogenous nature of such attacks was compared with analogous global contagion risks of COVID-19 and their global and national 'spread' that all are monitoring. Over the subsequent few weeks, the COVID-19 global pandemic had unfolded with major adverse impacts evident across public health, global financial and economic, and, global geopolitical, national defense and security, and, related socioeconomic domains. The Survival & Sustainability of Systems at all levels which is at stake and the respective critical significance of Command & Controls - spanning global, national, organizational, individual, and, even human cellular levels of analysis – are being recognized worldwide as never before on the COVID-19 pandemic threats and vulnerabilities ""global theater"". The respective role of such Command & Controls that are the most essential defining attributes of all Self-Adaptive Systems and their self-identity, self-regulation, and, self-determination are also being recognized in terms of determining the Sustainability and Survival of the respective Systems at all levels. For preempting and preventing future similar global threats such as COVID-19, we need to develop and deploy Adversarial C2 systems to stress test the robustness of C2 for respective Systems as well as Counter-Adversarial C2 to counter the adversarial threats.

More specifically, primary indicators and contributing factors associated with systemic risk are assessed for the insurance sector. A distinction is made between the core activities of insurers (e.g., underwriting, reserving, claims settlement, etc.) and their non-core activities (such as providing financial guarantees).  Statistical analysis of insurer characteristics and their relationship with a well-known systemic risk measure, SRISK, is provided. The core activities of property-casualty insurers are found not to be systemically risky.  However, we find evidence that some core activities of life insurers, particularly separate accounts and group annuities, may be associated with systemic risk. The non-core activities of both types of insurers can contribute to systemic risk. The study also finds that insurers may be susceptible to intra-sector crises such as reinsurance crises arising from counterparty credit risk. New and proposed state and federal regulations are reviewed in light of the potential for systemic risk for this sector.",本章分析美国保险公司的特征，以判断其是否具有系统性风险。具体而言，评估了保险业与系统性风险相关的主要指标和影响因素。研究区分了保险公司的核心业务（如承保、准备金计提、理赔等）与非核心业务（如提供金融担保）。通过统计分析保险公司特征与知名系统性风险指标SRISK的关系，发现财产意外险公司的核心业务不存在系统性风险，但寿险公司的某些核心业务（特别是独立账户和团体年金）可能具有系统性风险。两类保险公司的非核心业务均可能引发系统性风险。研究还表明保险公司易受行业内部危机影响，例如由交易对手信用风险引发的再保险危机。基于该行业潜在的系统性风险，本章还审视了各州及联邦已实施和拟议的新监管措施。,"insurance regulation, systemic risk, reinsurance, SRISK, systemically important financial institution, insurance insolvencies",2014-02-26

risk control,RiskManagement: The Reinvention of InternalControland the Changing Role of Internal Audit,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=483743,Laura F. Spira,"The publication of the Turnbull guidance represented a radical redefinition of the nature of internal control as a feature of corporate governance in the UK, explicitly aligning internal control with risk management. This paper explores this change, using sociological perspectives on risk and its conceptualisation to frame the debate about internal control and risk management within the UK corporate governance arena - the most recent manifestation of an ongoing competition for the control of economic and social resources. The paper demonstrates that developments in corporate governance reporting requirements offer opportunities for the appropriation of risk and its management by groups wishing to advance their own interests. This is illustrated by a review of recent changes in internal audit.",《特恩布尔指南》的发布标志着英国公司治理中内部控制性质的根本性重新定义，明确将内部控制与风险管理相挂钩。本文通过社会学视角对风险及其概念化的探讨，审视这一变革，从而在英国公司治理领域——这场持续争夺经济和社会资源控制权的最新表现形式中——构建关于内部控制与风险管理的讨论框架。研究表明，公司治理报告要求的发展为某些群体提供了将风险及其管理手段据为己有的机会，以此推进自身利益。这一现象通过近期内部审计领域的变革得到了印证。,"Risk management, Internal control, Internal auditing, Corporate governance, United Kingdom",2004-01-05

We derive the time-consistent Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for the equilibrium value function and significantly reduce the number of state variables, which makes the HJB equation derived in this paper much easier to solve than the extended HJB equation in the literature. We illustrate the usefulness of the time-consistent HJB equation with several examples which recover the known results in the literature and go beyond, including a mean-variance model with stochastic volatility dependent risk aversion, a utility deviation-risk model with state dependent risk aversion and control constraint, and a constrained portfolio selection model. The numerical and statistical tests show that the utility and deviation-risk have a significant impact on the equilibrium control strategy and the distribution of the terminal wealth.",本文提出了一种统一的效用偏差-风险模型，该模型将效用最大化和均值-方差分析作为特例涵盖其中。我们推导了均衡值函数的时间一致Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman（HJB）方程，并显著减少了状态变量的数量，这使得本文导出的HJB方程比文献中的扩展HJB方程更易于求解。我们通过多个示例说明了时间一致HJB方程的实用性，这些示例不仅重现了文献中的已知结果，还进一步扩展了应用范围，包括具有随机波动率依赖风险厌恶的均值-方差模型、具有状态依赖风险厌恶和控制约束的效用偏差-风险模型，以及一个带约束的投资组合选择模型。数值与统计测试表明，效用和偏差-风险对均衡控制策略及终端财富分布具有显著影响。,utility deviation-risk optimization; stochastic risk aversion; incomplete market; control constraint; time-consistent dynamic programming equation,2019-05-30
risk control,"Capital Floors, the Revised SA and the Cost of Loans in Switzerland",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2832336,Simone Bernardi,"The Basel Committee plans to revise the Standardised Approach (SA) to bank capital for credit risk and to employ the revised SA as a floor for bank capital based on internal models. The changes are likely to have a major impact on the overall level of capital and its distribution across banks and asset classes. This paper examines the effects of the proposed changes in capital rules on the Swiss loan market. Using primarily public information, we estimate the effects on the capital of individual Swiss banks broken down by asset class. We infer what this is likely to imply for lending rates in the Swiss market. We find that the proposed rule changes would substantially boost capital overall, affecting most severely capital for Corporate and Specialised Lending exposures. Under the BCBS 347 proposals, total bank capital would rise 39% while capital for Corporate and Specialised Lending exposures would increase by 142% and 130%, respectively. This allocation of capital across asset classes is inconsistent with the lessons of the recent financial crisis which was triggered by the collapse of the US residential mortgage market and involved relatively little impact on the quality of corporate credit.

To prevent maritime accidents, we investigated and studied typical cases of maritime accidents along the coast of China in recent years. Based on the complex network theory, a network model of China's coastal maritime traffic accidents is constructed from the four risk factors of human-ship-environmental-management. On this basis, the overall structural characteristics of the maritime accident network are analyzed according to the characteristic parameters of the complex network. In addition, based on the node betweenness and PageRank value, the network robustness analysis is carried out, the key factors in the maritime accidents are excavated and risk prevention and control measures are proposed. The research shows that the average path length of the marine traffic accident network is short, the clustering coefficient is high, and the risk spreads quickly in the network and passes through fewer nodes, which can lead to the occurrence of accidents. Through the management and control of key risk factors, the evolution of risks can be effectively blocked and the large and above maritime accidents can be reduced.",摘要：日益繁忙的海上交通系统导致海上事故频发。为预防海上事故的发生，对近年来我国沿海典型海上事故案例进行调查和研究，基于复杂网络理论，从人-船-环境-管理4个风险因素出发构建我国沿海海上交通事故网络模型。在此基础上，根据复杂网络的特征参数对海上事故网络的整体结构特征进行分析。此外，基于节点介数和PageRank值进行网络鲁棒性分析，挖掘海上事故中的关键因素并提出风险防控措施。研究表明，海上交通事故网络的平均路径长度较短，聚类系数较高，风险在网络中传播速度快且经过较少的节点即可导致事故的发生。通过对关键风险因素进行管控，可有效阻断风险的演化，减少较大及以上海上事故的发生。,"maritime accident, complex network, risk evolution, risk control, prevention and control strategies",2022-10-29

The concept of full movement beyond control can be illustrated in several domains. The more specific areas of environmental protection and sustainable development highlight two significant examples: the movement of greenhouse gas and the movement of waste.  The hypothesis proposed here is that there exists a silent risk of full movement beyond control. Even as a discernible and potentially measurable phenomenon, the risk of full and beyond control is commonly denied or underestimated. Its treatment is generally based on the illusion that, since it is man who created the movement, he will always have the ability to regain control of it. This flawed approach to the risk explains many of the difficulties encountered in environmental governance matters, particularly in the area of sustainable development and especially when such difficulties motivate the rule of law. Using the idea of silent risk may also be useful for granting full movement beyond control the transversal and inclusive place it warrants.",本文为一项关于法律如何应对完全运动的地球物理现象的研究项目提供了输入。所谓完全运动，指的是由人类引发但人类无法控制的运动。失控的完全运动这一概念可在多个领域中得以阐明。环境保护与可持续发展这两个具体领域尤为突出地体现了两个重要实例：温室气体的运动和废弃物的运动。本文提出的假设是，失控的完全运动存在一种隐性风险。即便作为一种可识别且可能量化的现象，完全且失控的风险通常被否认或低估。对其处理往往基于一种错觉：既然是人类创造了这种运动，人类就始终有能力重新掌控它。这种对风险的错误认知解释了许多环境治理事务中遇到的困难，尤其是在可持续发展领域，特别是当这些困难推动法治进程时。运用隐性风险的概念，或许也有助于赋予失控的完全运动应有的横向包容地位。,"Silent Risk, Full Movement, Lost of Control, Greenhouse Gas, Waste, Carbon Tax, Climate Change Policy",2018-11-08
risk control,The Effect ofControlSystems on Cooperation under EnvironmentalRisk,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5224861,Robert Grasser,"Prior research shows that formal controls such as explicit financial incentives and feedback about partner behavior (or equivalent mutual monitoring) help overcome relational risk in collaborative settings and increase cooperation. Environmental risk requires collaborators to infer cooperation from noisy outcomes, making attributions to their partner’s trustworthiness more difficult and cooperation harder to sustain. We investigate whether prior results on the effectiveness of (removed) formal controls hold under environmental risk. Importantly, we distinguish two common job designs (i.e., whether collaborators can mutually monitor cooperative actions or not) and isolate the effect of this variable from the effect of financial incentives. First, as a baseline with prior studies, we predict and find that mutual monitoring provides reliable information about partner behavior that mitigates difficulties for cooperation introduced by environmental risk. Second, financial incentives continue to have benefits for long-term cooperation (i.e., after their removal) not only when mutual monitoring is present, but also when mutual monitoring is absent and the difficulties for cooperation associated with environmental risk can take full effect. We provide supplemental evidence on the role of trust and perceived relational risk. Our results have implications for organizations’ control system design given environmental risk is inherent in business.",先前研究表明，正式控制手段（如明确的经济激励和关于合作伙伴行为的反馈，或等效的相互监督）有助于克服协作环境中的关系风险并促进合作。环境风险要求合作者从嘈杂的结果中推断合作行为，这使得将结果归因于合作伙伴的可信度变得更加困难，合作也更难维持。我们探讨了在环境风险下，先前关于（已移除的）正式控制手段有效性的研究结果是否仍然成立。重要的是，我们区分了两种常见的工作设计（即合作者是否能相互监督合作行为），并将该变量的影响与经济激励的影响区分开来。首先，作为与先前研究的基线，我们预测并发现相互监督提供了关于合作伙伴行为的可靠信息，从而减轻了环境风险给合作带来的困难。其次，经济激励不仅在有相互监督时，而且在没有相互监督且环境风险对合作的困难影响完全显现时，仍对长期合作（即在其移除后）具有持续益处。我们还提供了关于信任和感知关系风险作用的补充证据。鉴于环境风险在商业中普遍存在，我们的研究结果对组织控制系统的设计具有启示意义。,"control systems, cooperation, environmental risk, mutual monitoring, social dilemma",2025-05-06

In contrast to monoperiodic models, self-insurance and self-protection react very similarly to an increase in risk aversion, i.e., increased risk aversion is associated with more effort if and only if current consumption is sufficiently large. Only if savings are endogenized, the classical findings are recouped. Then, increased risk aversion leads to more self-insurance in any case, and increased risk aversion leads to more self-protection if and only if the loss probability is below an endogenous threshold, extending results obtained by Dionne and Eeckhoudt (1985).",本文研究了在两期预期效用框架下，风险厌恶程度增加对自我保险和自我保护的影响，其中风险降低投资先于其效果发生。与单期模型不同，自我保险和自我保护对风险厌恶程度增加的反应非常相似，即只有当当前消费足够大时，风险厌恶程度增加才会与更多努力相关联。只有在储蓄被内生化的情形下，经典结论才能重现。此时，风险厌恶程度增加总会导致更多自我保险；而风险厌恶程度增加导致更多自我保护，当且仅当损失概率低于内生阈值，这扩展了Dionne和Eeckhoudt（1985）的研究成果。,"self-insurance, self-protection, saving, risk aversion",2013-09-07

We find that: (i) there are heterogeneous effects of China's capital control policies on GDP growth distribution: the aggregated capital control indices are beneficial in reducing the downside risk of real GDP growth in medium term whereas they are costly on the upswings of real GDP growth in near-term; (ii) the marginal effects of capital control indices on GDP growth over quantiles show that the heterogeneous effects are stronger in near-term than medium term; (iii) specifically, these heterogeneous effects are more evident in short term for outflow control index and resident transaction control index; (iv) the granular capital control indices show broadly heterogeneous effects even if several of them are statistically insignificant.",资本账户开放通常对发展中国家和新兴国家有利。然而，若一国存在下行风险，资本管制政策可防止其暴露于利差交易流动和资本外逃，并保护其免受外部金融波动影响。本文通过结合局部投影的分位数回归与拟合偏态t分布，研究了中国各类资本管制指标对GDP增长分布及其期限结构的边际效应。研究发现：（一）中国资本管制政策对GDP增长分布存在异质性影响：综合资本管制指标有助于降低中期实际GDP增长的下行风险，但会在短期内抑制实际GDP增长的上升空间；（二）资本管制指标对GDP增长分位数的边际效应表明，这种异质性影响在短期内比中期更为显著；（三）具体而言，流出管制指标和居民交易管制指标的异质性效应在短期更为明显；（四）细分资本管制指标普遍呈现异质性影响，尽管部分指标在统计上不显著。,"capital control policy, growth-at-risk, quantile regressions, narrative approach",2022-02-09

risk control,A stochasticcontrolperspective on term structure models with roll-overrisk,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4412350,Claudio Fontana,"In this paper, we consider a generic interest rate market in the presence of roll-over risk, which generates spreads in spot/forward term rates. We do not require classical absence of arbitrage and rely instead on a minimal market viability assumption, which enables us to work in the context of the benchmark approach. In a Markovian setting, we extend the control theoretic approach of \cite{GR13} and derive representations of spot/forward spreads as value functions of suitable stochastic optimal control problems, formulated under the real-world probability and with power-type objective functionals. We determine endogenously the funding-liquidity spread by relating it to the risk-sensitive optimization problem of a representative investor.",本文研究了一个存在展期风险的通用利率市场，该风险导致即期/远期期限利率产生利差。我们摒弃了传统无套利假设，转而采用最低限度的市场可行性假设，这使得我们能够在基准方法的框架下开展工作。在马尔可夫环境下，我们扩展了\cite{GR13}的控制理论方法，将即期/远期利差表示为适当随机最优控制问题的值函数——这些问题在真实概率测度下构建，并采用幂型目标泛函。通过将融资流动性利差与代表性投资者的风险敏感优化问题相关联，我们实现了对该利差的内生性确定。,"Roll-over risk, liquidity risk, interest rate, multiplicative spread, term rate, benchmark approach, stochastic control, risk-sensitive portfolio optimization",2023-04-19
risk control,FrontexRiskAnalysis and the Crisis-driven Expansion of Coordinated European BorderControl,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4930077,Regine Paul,"Migration scholars have captured the (growing) relevance of Frontex risk analysis in the governance of borders and migration in Europe in two distinct ways. On the one hand, research interprets risk analysis as a Foucauldian governance tool which constructs migration as a risk and legitimizes securitizing interventions at the border. On the other hand, risk analysis is perceived as an internally-oriented rationalization tool which (a) limits supranational responsibility for emergency responses – shifting any blame for failure to deal with ‘normal’ and residual border risks to member states – but which equally (b) institutionalizes a leading role for EU-level and coordinated interventions when facing the high-risk scenarios depicted in Frontex risk analyses. The chapter proposes that the role of Frontexrisk analysis cannot be reduced to a tool for securitizing migration. It also serves as a powerful epistemological underbelly for managing subsidiarity problems in multi-level governance, with Frontex having been able to substantively expand EU-level coordination and responsibilities for border control despite the weak formal integration of the policy domain. In other words: while Frontex constitutes migrants as governable risks through its risk-analytical work, the agency also uses risk analysis to constitute its own (ever more influential) institutional future in European border control.","移民学者们以两种不同的方式捕捉到了Frontex风险分析在欧洲边境与移民治理中日益增长的重要性。一方面，研究将风险分析解读为一种福柯式的治理工具——它将移民建构为风险，并为边境安全化干预提供正当性。另一方面，风险分析被视为一种内向型理性化工具：它既（a）限定了超国家层面对紧急状况的响应责任（将应对""常规""及剩余边境风险失败的责任转嫁给成员国），又（b）在面对Frontex风险分析所描绘的高风险情景时，制度化欧盟层面协调干预的主导角色。本章指出，Frontex风险分析的作用不能简单归结为移民安全化工具。它更是处理多层级治理中辅助性原则难题的强大认识论工具——尽管该政策领域的形式整合程度较弱，Frontex仍借此实质性扩展了欧盟层面的边境管控协调与责任。换言之：Frontex通过风险分析工作将移民建构为可治理风险的同时，也运用风险分析在欧洲边境管控领域建构自身（日益强大的）制度未来。","migration policy, border control, risk analysis, European integration, Frontex, policy coordination",2024-09-19

In our study, we build on Allen and Bali (2007), and infer extreme risk in financial institutions and its operational component.  Our contribution is twofold: first, extending the specification and estimation procedure for the model, and then estimating on a dataset of European institutions, spanning major turmoil episodes in the past two decades. Operational risk is evaluated individually for each institution, by regressing monthly stock returns on proxies that capture institutions exposure to market and credit risks.  The residuals are used to infer operational VaR for financial companies using extreme value theory.

This study focused on the pollution status, spatial distribution, possible sources of perchlorate in raw cow milk collected from 155 dairy farms in China, as well as the health risk of exposure to perchlorate through dairy products.The results showed that the detection rate of perchlorate in raw milk was 100% with the mean of 15.87μg/kg, indicating the ubiquitous contamination of perchlorate in raw milk from China. The simulation of spatial distributions of perchlorate in raw milk indicates high levels of perchlorate exist in certain parts of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, and Zhejiang, suggesting perchlorate contamination might exsit in these regions. The levels of perchlorate in raw milk were positively correlated with perchlorate in cow feed, indicating that perchlorate in raw milk might transfer from cow feed. Therefore, the perchlorate levels in cow feed could be reduced to decrease the perchlorate levels in raw milk in some polluted regions. The hazard quotient (HQ) values of exposure to perchlorate by dairy products ranged from 0-2.136, with the mean of 0.019 and P95 of 0.101, indicating relatively low health risk to perchlorate through dairy products. To our knowledge, this is the first nationwide study on the spatial distribution and risk assessment of perchlorate in raw cow milk from China.",高氯酸盐是一种全球普遍存在的环境污染物，被认定为新兴甲状腺毒素。本研究针对中国155个奶牛场采集的生牛乳中高氯酸盐的污染现状、空间分布、潜在来源及通过乳制品摄入的健康风险展开分析。结果表明生牛乳中高氯酸盐检出率达100%，平均含量为15.87微克/千克，证实我国生牛乳普遍存在高氯酸盐污染。空间分布模拟显示京津冀部分地区、山西、河南及浙江存在高浓度污染区，提示这些区域可能存在高氯酸盐污染源。生牛乳中高氯酸盐含量与奶牛饲料呈正相关，表明污染可能源自饲料传递，因此可通过控制污染区饲料含量降低生牛乳污染水平。乳制品摄入高氯酸盐的危害商值（HQ）范围为0-2.136，均值为0.019，P95值为0.101，显示通过乳制品摄入的健康风险总体较低。据我们所知，这是首个全国范围内生牛乳高氯酸盐空间分布与风险评估研究。,"Raw cow milk, Perchlorate, Spatial distribution, Health risk",2024-07-11
risk detection,The Effect of Decentralized Behavioral Decision Making on System-LevelRisk,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2429423,Kim Kaivanto,"Certain classes of system-level risk depend partly on decentralized lay decision making. For instance, an organization's network security risk depends partly on its employees' responses to phishing attacks. On a larger scale, the risk within a financial system depends partly on households' responses to mortgage sales pitches. Behavioral economics shows that lay decision makers typically depart in systematic ways from the normative rationality of Expected Utility (EU), and instead display heuristics and biases as captured in the more descriptively accurate Prospect Theory (PT). In turn psychological studies show that successful deception ploys eschew direct logical argumentation and instead employ peripheral-route persuasion, manipulation of visceral emotions, urgency, and familiar contextual cues. The detection of phishing emails and inappropriate mortgage contracts may be framed as a binary classification task. Signal Detection Theory (SDT) offers the standard normative solution, formulated as an optimal cutoff threshold, for distinguishing between good/bad emails or mortgages. In this paper we extend SDT behaviorally by re-deriving the optimal cutoff threshold under PT. Furthermore we incorporate the psychology of deception into determination of SDT's discriminability parameter. With the neo-additive probability weighting function, the optimal cutoff threshold under PT is rendered unique under well-behaved sampling distributions, tractable in computation, and transparent in interpretation. The PT-based cutoff threshold is (i) independent of loss aversion and (ii) more conservative than the classical SDT cutoff threshold. Independently of any possible misalignment between individual-level and system-level misclassification costs, decentralized behavioral decision makers are biased toward under-detection, and system-level risk is consequently greater than in analyses predicated upon normative rationality.",某些系统级风险类别部分依赖于分散的非专业决策。例如，一个组织的网络安全风险部分取决于员工对钓鱼攻击的反应。更大范围内，金融体系的风险部分取决于家庭对抵押贷款推销的应对方式。行为经济学表明，非专业决策者通常会以系统性方式偏离期望效用理论（EU）的规范性理性，转而表现出启发式与偏见，这些特征在描述性更准确的前景理论（PT）中得以体现。心理学研究则显示，成功的欺骗手段会避开直接逻辑论证，转而采用外围路径说服、操纵本能情绪、制造紧迫感及利用熟悉情境线索。检测钓鱼邮件和不适当抵押合同可视为二元分类任务。信号检测理论（SDT）提供了标准规范性解决方案——通过最优截止阈值区分良性/恶意邮件或贷款。本文从行为角度拓展SDT，在PT框架下重新推导最优截止阈值，并将欺骗心理学融入SDT辨别力参数的确定过程。采用新可加概率加权函数时，PT下的最优截止阈值在良好抽样分布中具有唯一性、计算易处理性及解释透明性。基于PT的截止阈值具有两大特征：（1）与损失厌恶无关；（2）比经典SDT阈值更保守。即使不考虑个体层面与系统层面误判成本的潜在错配，分散的行为决策者也存在检测不足的倾向，因此系统风险会大于基于规范性理性的分析结果。,"system-level risk, Signal Detection Theory, Prospect Theory, psychology of deception, spear phishing",2014-04-27
risk detection,DecouplingRiskDetectionand Captioning Via Dual-Branch Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Fusion for Autonomous Driving,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5101150,Zeyu Pan,"Risk detection aims to identify the objects that threaten the driver, while the captioning task focuses on generating a caption to describe the scene and provide driving suggestions. Previous methods train the model coupling risk detection and captioning task with a single low-resolution input. However, they face two primary challenges: 1) they only handle the video captioning task while failing to handle the other closely relevant downstream task such as question answering, and visual grounding; 2) they fail to well detect small objects in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-branch Multi-scale Spatial-temporal Fusion (DMSF) method to decouple the two tasks, i.e., risk detection and captioning. In particular, it unleashes the potential of the vision-language model for more relevant downstream tasks, e.g., multi-modal question answering. Specifically, our method incorporates a High-Low Resolution Spatial-Temporal Fusion module that integrates multi-scale visual features from the high-resolution frames and spatial-temporal features from low-resolution frames. This helps the model to capture the small objects. Meanwhile, our method utilizes a Dual-Branch Abstractor to decouple the risk detection and captioning tasks, while consider the visual token cues by an abstractor. Experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in both risk detection and captioning tasks. For example, it achieves a SPICE (Semantic Propositional Image Caption Evaluation) score of 66.2 for captioning and improves detection performance by a gain of 5% in terms of mIoU (mean Intersection over Union).",风险检测旨在识别威胁驾驶员的物体，而描述任务则侧重于生成场景描述并提供驾驶建议。现有方法通常采用单一低分辨率输入耦合训练风险检测与描述任务模型，但面临两大核心挑战：1)仅能处理视频描述任务，无法应对问答、视觉定位等其他紧密相关的下游任务；2)难以有效检测复杂场景中的小物体。为此，我们提出双分支多尺度时空融合（DMSF）方法，将风险检测与描述任务解耦。该方法释放了视觉语言模型在多模态问答等下游任务中的潜力，具体通过高低分辨率时空融合模块整合高分辨率帧的多尺度视觉特征与低分辨率帧的时空特征，显著提升小物体检测能力；同时采用双分支抽象器解耦两项任务，并通过抽象器融合视觉标记线索。基准数据集实验表明，本方法在描述任务中取得66.2的SPICE分数，检测任务mIoU指标提升5%。,"Video captioning, risk detection, spatial-temporal fusion, Autonomous driving",2025-01-17

There has been little research on the behavioural traits linked to good performance for either of these roles.We developed a survey to investigate which behavioural attributes are most important in Medical detection dogs and to examine how these attributes vary between dogs used for biodetection and medical alert assistance tasks.The survey was completed by 62 professionals from 16 different countries. Participants considered 40 behavioural traits for each rating: importance during selection, the ideal level required, and the level shown by a dog with which they had recently worked. Overall, 39 respondents rated assistance dogs and 23 rated biodetection dogs.The most important traits were 'Level of motivation when working' (on a scale of 1-5 mean=4.66±0.51), 'Health' (4.60±0.62), 'Ability to learn from being rewarded' (4.57±0.57), 'Concentration' (4.57±0.60) and 'Acuity of sense of smell' (4.5±0.76). Trait importance differed significantly between the two roles; 'Level of Attachment to human partner' (U=685, p=0.001), 'Confidence in different environments' (U=604 p=0.002) and 'Travel ability' (U=576, p=0.018) were deemed significantly more important for assistance dogs. 'Acuity of sense of smell' (U=280, p=0.004), 'Tendency to be distracted when working' (U=279.5 p=0.009) and 'Ability to solve problems when working' (U=310 p=0.009) were more important for biodetection dogs.Ideal levels also differed between the roles, for example. biodetection dogs were thought to require higher levels of 'Tendency to search by smell alone' (U=277.5 p=0.006) but lower levels of 'Attachment to human partner' (U=277.5 p <0.001) than assistance dogs. When comparing ratings for the current dogs to the perceived ideal levels, there were significant deviations in several traits; e.g., dogs were generally rated as having higher than desired levels of 'General excitability' (mean deviation=1.02) and 'Tendency to be distracted when working' (mean deviation=1.00).Paying particular attention to important traits and those that differ greatly from ideal levels when selecting Medical detection dogs may aid in improving task success.

In contrast to previous research on assessing the accuracy of risk systems or VaR, which has focused on backtesting a large sample of  historical observations, we provide tools for real-time assessment, using a time window that varies adaptively with the data.  The objective is to quickly signal if the estimation process is systematically biased, subject to a specified rate of false detections.  For example, if the volatility is systematically underestimated by 25 percent our procedure detects this in an average of 25 observations.  Previous techniques have often backtested thousands of observations.

Arkes,"There are times when a forensic scientist may not be comfortable drawing a firm conclusion about whether a questioned sample that appears to contain useful identifying information did or did not come from a particular known source. In such cases, the forensic scientist may call the sample pair “inconclusive.”  We suggest that signal detection theory (SDT), which is concerned with the detection of weak signals in noisy environments, provides a useful framework for understanding the role that inconclusives play in the various feature-matching forensic sciences. SDT shows that “inconclusive” is often an appropriate response depending on both the strength of the signal in the samples and the thresholds adopted by the examiner.

Often, correlations have to be estimated from relatively short time series, and the resulting estimation error hinders the detection of a signal. We suggest a general method of parameter estimation which avoids in a controlled way the underestimation of correlation risk. Empirical evidence is presented how, in the framework of the CreditRisk+ model with integrated correlations, this method leads to an increased economic capital estimate.

risk detection,"Economics of User Segmentation, Profiling, andDetectionin Security",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=916373,Bin Mai,"User profiling, which classifies users into different risk classes, is regarded as a cost effective method to ensure adequate security of critical assets and services in many domains in which adversaries have heterogeneous incentives to commit security breaches. The benefit of profiling is that it allows firms to use an optimally designed and possibly a different detection system for each risk class whereas all users will be sent through the same detection system when profiling is not used. While profiling can be a useful tool in security, we show that the use of profiling and multiple detection systems increases high-risk users' incentives to fake their identity, and that this incentive increases when the profiling accuracy increases. The direct effect of an increase in the profiling accuracy is the increase in the likelihood that a high-risk user faking his identity will be classified as a low-risk user. The indirect effect is that the higher disparity in optimal detection rates for the high- and low-risk users resulting from a higher profiling accuracy provides more incentive for high-risk users to fake.  If faking is sufficiently easy or the profiling accuracy is sufficiently poor, then the use of profiling results in a more expensive and less secure security system. We show that, in order to reap the maximum benefit out of profiling, an improvement in the accuracy of profiling technology should be accompanied by a minimum level of increase in the users' cost to fake or cheat the profiling system. If faking is not an issue, then it is optimal for a firm to design detection systems that operate at their efficient detection rates; the efficient detection rate for a high-risk (low-risk) user increases (decreases) when the profiling accuracy increases. However, we show that, when faking is possible, if the profiling accuracy is higher than a threshold value, then it is optimal to make the detection systems more similar by degrading the detection rate of the detection system for a high-risk user and enhancing the detection rate of the detection system for a low-risk user.",用户画像技术通过将用户划分为不同风险等级，被视为保障关键资产与服务安全的成本效益型方法，尤其适用于攻击动机存在显著差异的多个领域。该技术的优势在于：企业可为每个风险等级定制最优检测系统，而无画像技术时所有用户需通过同一套检测机制。尽管画像技术能提升安防效能，但我们的研究表明，采用多套检测系统会刺激高风险用户伪造身份，且这种动机随着画像精度的提升而增强。精度提高的直接效应是：高风险用户伪装成低风险类别的成功率上升；间接效应则是：高低风险用户间最优检测率的差距扩大，进一步激励高风险用户实施身份欺诈。若伪造成本过低或画像精度过差，采用画像技术反而会导致安防系统成本攀升且防护效能下降。研究证明，要最大化画像技术收益，必须在提升画像精度的同时，同步提高用户伪造身份的最低成本门槛。当不存在身份伪造风险时，企业最优策略是让高低风险用户的检测系统分别运行在效率最优的检测率——画像精度提升会相应提高（降低）对高风险（低风险）用户的检测强度。但存在伪造行为时，若画像精度超过临界值，则需通过降低高风险用户检测强度、提升低风险用户检测强度，使两套系统检测率趋同才符合最优策略。,"user profiling, inteligent adversary, detection system",2006-07-17

Risk Targeting in portfolio construction is implemented to improve capital utilization in growing markets and systematically step away from risk scenarios. However, the performance of risk targeting varies with different implementations of risk estimation. Risk Targeting using recent backward volatility estimates is the most popular risk targeting mechanism but it could not have anticipated a deep crisis like 2008 and it would hurt in range bound situations like the February 2018 drop and bounce back or the December 2018 drop and January 2019 bounce back. The drawbacks of recent volatility are that in such a risk model, short-term volatility is being used to detect a long-term risk event with and short term mean reversion effects are ignored .In this work, we will try to separate risk estimation into two risk models, a long-term risk model that predicts extreme risk scenarios based on macroeconomic data and a short-term risk model that adjusts risk based on short-term mean reversion effects. We then combine the output of the two risk models into a risk measure that enables a risk targeted allocation strategy to outperform static allocation in both crisis periods like 2008 and mean-reverting periods like 2018.Note that risk for a real-money investor is not an expectation of volatility but a measure of the probability  of losing money if one is allocated to that asset class. Hence, we try to forecast a risk value which, if interpreted as a probability of loss, outperforms a baseline estimate of risk.",在这项工作中，我们发现了一种能提升风险目标策略表现的风险模型。投资组合构建中的风险目标策略旨在提高增长市场中的资本利用率，并系统性规避风险情景。然而，不同风险估算方法会导致风险目标策略的表现存在差异。采用近期历史波动率估算的风险目标策略是最常见的机制，但它无法预见如2008年的深度危机，且在震荡行情中表现不佳——例如2018年2月暴跌反弹或2018年12月暴跌2019年1月反弹的情形。近期波动率模型的缺陷在于：此类模型使用短期波动率来检测长期风险事件，同时忽略了短期均值回归效应。本研究尝试将风险估算拆分为两个模型：基于宏观经济数据预测极端风险情景的长期风险模型，以及根据短期均值回归效应调整风险的短期风险模型。随后我们将两个模型的输出结果整合为统一风险指标，使得风险目标配置策略在2008年等危机时期和2018年等均值回归时期均能超越静态配置策略。需注意的是，对于实际资金投资者而言，风险并非波动率预期，而是配置该资产类别时发生亏损的概率度量。因此我们尝试预测的风险值若被解读为亏损概率，其表现需优于基线风险估计。,"Risk Targeting, Tactical Asset Allocation, Regime Detection, Risk Prediction, Portfolio Construction",2019-05-28

Mishra,"An important requirement of an intrusion detection system (IDS) is that it be effective and efficient; that is, it should detect a large percentage of intrusions, while still keeping the false alarm rate at an acceptable level. In order to meet this requirement, the model and algorithm used by the IDS need to be calibrated or configured. The optimal configuration depends on several factors. The first factor is the quality profile of the IDS as indicated by its ROC (receiver operating characteristics), curve that relates the detection accuracy and the false alarm rate. The shape of the ROC curve depends on the detection technology used by the IDS. The second factor is the cost structure of the firm using the IDS. The third factor is the strategic behavior of hackers. A hacker’s behavior is influenced by the likelihood that (s)he will be caught, which, in turn, is dependent on the configuration of the IDS. In this article, we present an economic optimization model based on game theory that provides insights into optimal configuration of IDS. We present analytical as well as computational results.

Existing approaches suffer from high computational complexity, low predictive capability, and limited interpretability. As a remedy, we present a novel outlier detection algorithm called COPOD, which is inspired by copulas for modeling multivariate data distribution. COPOD first constructs an empirical copula, and then uses it to predict tail probabilities of each given data point to determine its level of ""extremeness"". Intuitively, we think of this as calculating an anomalous p-value. This makes COPOD both parameter-free, highly interpretable, and computationally efficient. In this work, we make three key contributions, 1) propose a novel, parameter-free outlier detection algorithm with both great performance and interpretability, 2) perform extensive experiments on 30 benchmark datasets to show that COPOD outperforms in most cases and is also one of the fastest algorithms, and 3) release an easy-to-use Python implementation for reproducibility.","异常值检测指的是识别偏离一般数据分布的罕见项。现有方法存在计算复杂度高、预测能力弱及可解释性有限的问题。为此，我们提出一种名为COPOD的新型异常检测算法，其灵感源自用于建模多元数据分布的copula理论。COPOD首先构建经验copula，随后利用其预测每个给定数据点的尾部概率以确定其""极端程度""。直观而言，这类似于计算异常p值。该方法使COPOD兼具无需参数设定、强可解释性和高效计算的特点。本研究作出三项关键贡献：1）提出兼具优异性能与可解释性的新型无参数异常检测算法；2）在30个基准数据集上开展大量实验，表明COPOD在多数情况下性能优越且属于最快算法之一；3）发布易于使用的Python实现以确保可复现性。","Outlier Detection, Anomaly Detection, Fraud Detection, Copula, Risk Management",2021-03-22

In a univariate setup, the extreme value analysis quantifies the unusualness of each outlier. In a multivariate setup, the local outlier factor method identifies outliers by measuring the local deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbours.

risk detection,Accounting For Violent ConflictRiskIn Planetary Defense Decisions,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3689838,Seth Baum,"This paper provides the first-ever survey of the implications of violent conflict risk for planetary defense program decisions. Arguably, the aim of planetary defense should be to make Earth safer from all threats, including but not limited to threats from near-Earth objects (NEOs). Insofar as planetary defense projects affect other risks besides NEOs, these other risks should be taken into account. This paper evaluates three potential effects of planetary defense programs on violent conflict risk. First, planetary defense may offer a constructive model for addressing a major global risk. By documenting the history of its successes and failures, the planetary defense community can aid efforts to address other global risks, including but not limited to violent conflict. Second, the proposed use of nuclear explosions for NEO deflection and disruption could affect the role of nuclear weapons in violent conflict risk. The effect may be such that nuclear deflection/disruption would increase aggregate risks to human society. However, the effect is difficult to assess, mainly due to ambiguities in violent conflict risk. Third, planetary defense could reduce violent conflict risk by addressing the possibility of NEO collisions being mistaken as violent attacks and inadvertently triggering violent conflict. False alarms mistaken as real attacks are a major concern, especially as a cause of nuclear war. Improved awareness of NEOs and communication between astronomers and military officials could help resolve NEO false alarms. Each of these three effects of planetary defense programs on violent conflict risk can benefit from interaction between the communities that study and address NEO and violent conflict risks.",本文首次探讨了暴力冲突风险对行星防御项目决策的影响。可以说，行星防御的目标应是使地球免受所有威胁，包括但不限于近地天体（NEOs）的威胁。既然行星防御项目会影响近地天体以外的其他风险，这些风险也应纳入考量。本文评估了行星防御项目对暴力冲突风险的三种潜在影响：首先，行星防御可为应对重大全球风险提供建设性范例。通过记录其成功与失败的历史，行星防御界有助于应对包括暴力冲突在内的其他全球风险。其次，利用核爆炸偏转或摧毁近地天体的提议可能影响核武器在暴力冲突风险中的作用。这种影响可能导致核偏转/摧毁技术增加人类社会的整体风险，但由于暴力冲突风险存在诸多不确定性，该影响难以评估。第三，行星防御可通过消除近地天体碰撞被误判为暴力攻击的可能性，从而降低意外引发暴力冲突的风险。将虚假警报误认为真实攻击是重大隐患，尤其是可能引发核战争。提高对近地天体的认知并加强天文学家与军事官员间的沟通，有助于化解近地天体误报危机。研究近地天体风险与暴力冲突风险的群体相互交流，将有助于优化上述三种影响。,"nuclear weapons, planetary defense, risk analysis, risk management, violent conflict",2020-10-29

We conduct an experiment in which we manipulate provision of information about an internal control material weakness. We find that when fraud risk is heightened by provision of material weakness information, audit seniors’ programs are of lower quality. This occurs because these auditors tend to propose audit program modifications that are not effective in detecting the fraud, resulting in programs that are less efficient. We also investigate determinants of higher quality audit programs, finding that program quality increases as auditors identify more risk factors focused on the specific fraud. These results suggest that identifying risk factors focused on the fraud area is critical to the development of high quality audit plans, and thus to fraud detection.",本文探讨了在存在具体欺诈假设线索的情况下，审计高级人员如何针对升高的欺诈风险修改标准审计程序。我们通过实验操纵了内部控制重大缺陷信息的提供，发现当重大缺陷信息提高欺诈风险时，审计高级人员制定的程序质量较低。这是因为这些审计师倾向于提出无法有效发现欺诈的程序修改方案，导致程序效率下降。我们还研究了高质量审计程序的决定因素，发现当审计师识别出更多针对特定欺诈的风险因素时，程序质量会提高。这些结果表明，聚焦于欺诈领域的风险因素识别对于制定高质量审计计划及发现欺诈至关重要。,"Audit planning, Fraud detection, Fraud risk factors, Audit seniors, Risk assessments",2008-07-28

It focuses on uncertainty in the human consequences of asteroid collisions, with emphasis on the possibility of global catastrophe to human civilization. A detailed survey of the asteroid risk literature shows that while human consequences are recognized as a major point of uncertainty, the studies focus mainly on physical and environmental dimensions of the risk. Some potential human consequences are omitted entirely, such as the possibility of asteroid explosions inadvertently causing nuclear war. Other human consequences are modeled with varying degrees of detail. Direct medical effects are relatively well-characterized, while human consequences of global environmental effects are more uncertain. The latter are evaluated mainly in terms of a global catastrophe threshold, but such a threshold is deeply uncertain and may not even exist. To handle threshold uncertainty in asteroid policy, this paper adapts the concept of policy boundaries from literature on anthropogenic global environmental change (i.e., planetary boundaries). The paper proposes policy boundaries of 100m asteroid diameter for global environmental effects and 1m for inadvertent nuclear war. Other policy implications include a more aggressive asteroid risk mitigation policy and measures to avoid inadvertent nuclear war. The paper argues that for rare events like large asteroid collisions, the absence of robust data means that a wide range of possible human consequences should be considered. This implies humility for risk analysis and erring on the side of caution in policy.",本文研究了小行星与地球相撞的风险，重点关注小行星撞击对人类影响的不确定性，尤其是对人类文明造成全球性灾难的可能性。通过对小行星风险文献的系统梳理发现，尽管人类影响被公认为主要的不确定因素，但现有研究仍集中于风险的物理与环境维度。某些潜在的人类影响被完全忽略，例如小行星爆炸意外引发核战争的可能性。其他人类影响的建模精细程度参差不齐——直接的医学效应已得到较好刻画，而全球环境效应引发的人类后果则存在更大不确定性。后者主要通过全球灾难阈值进行评估，但该阈值本身具有高度不确定性，甚至可能根本不存在。为应对小行星政策中的阈值不确定性，本文借鉴了人为全球环境变化研究（即行星边界理论）中的政策边界概念，提出针对全球环境效应的政策边界设为100米直径小行星，针对意外核战争的边界设为1米。其他政策建议包括实施更积极的小行星风险缓解政策，以及防范意外核战争的措施。本文指出，对于大型小行星撞击等罕见事件，由于缺乏可靠数据，应考虑各种可能的人类影响。这意味着风险分析需保持谦逊态度，政策制定应秉持谨慎原则。,"asteroids, risk analysis, global catastrophic risk, uncertainty",2018-08-06

Experts often disagree on the efficacy of these regulations. Compounding this problem banks regard their trade data required for a full analysis as proprietary. We adapt a simulation technology combining advances in graph theory to randomly generate entire financial systems sampled from realistic distributions with a novel open source risk engine to compute risks in financial systems under different regulations. This allows us to consistently evaluate, predict and optimize the impact of financial regulations on all levels - from a single trade to systemic risk - before it is implemented.

This paper focuses on two key dimensions of cyber risk—loss severity and tail risk—using three different cyber loss databases. We first focus on the dynamics of loss severity, identifying structural shifts in distributions through a Fr´echet-based change point detection method and applying inverse probability weighting to control for selection bias. Our results indicate an increase in the severity of malicious cyber losses since 2018, while negligent cyber incidents have exhibited a declining trend in severity.

risk detection,Semi-Supervised AnomalyDetectionfor Tank Leaks in Service Stations,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4729311,Li Chik,"Service station poses a significant risk to the surrounding environment and community due to the possibility of a fuel leak. Current practice for fuel loss detection in the underground storage system relies on traditional statistical regression models to analyse the daily data. However, these models are typically sensitive to the quality of the collected data, and it is also difficult to pinpoint the source of the problem as they could be in any part of the storage system. This study extends semi-supervised anomaly detection methods for tank leak detection by analysing the idle state of the storage system instead of all different possible states (to reduce unnecessary complexity) as in the daily data. The idle state dataset is able achieve a similar level of true positive rate compared to the daily data under settings in practise, while reducing the false positive rates (37% to 23%) and time to detection (50 to 30 days). Furthermore, both statistically based and deep learning based semi-supervised anomaly detection models are compared with the traditional statistical regression model for tank leak detection under various leak simulation scenarios. Under the optimal setting, both semi-supervised anomaly detection models can consistently achieve a higher true positive rate at lower false positive rates (≤23%) compared to the model used in the industry.

This study investigated the pollution status, spatial distribution, possible sources of perchlorate in raw cow milk collected from 155 dairy farms in China, as well as the health risk of exposure to perchlorate through dairy products.The results showed that the detection rate of perchlorate in raw milk was 100% with the mean of 15.87μg/kg, indicating the ubiquitous contamination of perchlorate in raw milk. The spatial distribution of perchlorate in raw milk indicates high levels of perchlorate exist in certain parts of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Jiangsu, Shandong, Zhejiang and Fujian. Therefore, increased attention should be paid to perchlorate in raw cow milk in these regions. The levels of perchlorate in raw milk were positively correlated with perchlorate in cow feed, indicating that perchlorate in raw milk might originate from cow feed.The hazard quotient (HQ) values of exposure to perchlorate by dairy products ranged from 0-2.136, with the mean of 0.019 and P95 of 0.101, indicating relatively low health risk to perchlorate through dairy products.

In the DEA-related literature, prior work on this issue has focused on the efficient frontier as a basis for detecting outliers. An iterative approach to deal with the potential for one outlier to mask the presence of another has been proposed but not demonstrated.  This paper proposes using both the efficient frontier and the inefficient frontier to identify outliers and thereby improve the accuracy of second stage results in two-stage nonparametric analysis.  The iterative outlier detection approach is implemented in a leave-one-out method using both the efficient frontier and the inefficient frontier and demonstrated in a two-stage semi-parametric bootstrapping analysis of a classic data set.  The results show that the conclusions drawn can be different when outlier identification includes consideration of the inefficient frontier.",在使用同群数据评估个体、典型或最佳实践表现时，有效识别异常值对获得有用结果至关重要，尤其是在两阶段分析中。在DEA相关文献中，此前关于此问题的研究主要聚焦于以效率前沿作为异常值检测基础。虽有研究提出迭代方法处理一个异常值掩盖另一个异常值的可能性，但未得到实证验证。本文提出同时利用效率前沿和非效率前沿来识别异常值，从而提高两阶段非参数分析中第二阶段结果的准确性。该迭代式异常值检测方法通过留一法实现，结合效率前沿与非效率前沿，并在经典数据集的两阶段半参数自助法分析中得到验证。结果表明，当异常值识别纳入非效率前沿考量时，所得结论可能发生变化。,"Data envelopment analysis, productivity, inefficient frontier, outlier detection",2006-08-03

risk detection,What is the BestRiskMeasure in Practice? A Comparison of Standard Measures,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2370378,Susanne Emmer,"Expected Shortfall (ES) has been widely accepted as a risk measure that is conceptually superior to Value-at-Risk (VaR). At the same time, however, it has been criticised for issues relating to backtesting. In particular, ES has been found not to be elicitable which means that backtesting for ES is less straightforward than, e.g., backtesting for VaR. Expectiles have been suggested as potentially better alternatives to both ES and VaR. In this paper, we revisit commonly accepted desirable properties of risk measures like coherence, comonotonic additivity, robustness and elicitability. We check VaR, ES and Expectiles with regard to whether or not they enjoy these properties, with particular emphasis on Expectiles. We also consider their impact on capital allocation, an important issue in risk management. We find that, despite the caveats that apply to the estimation and backtesting of ES, it can be considered a good risk measure. As a consequence, there is no sufficient evidence to justify an all-inclusive replacement of ES by Expectiles in applications. For backtesting ES, we propose an empirical approach that consists in replacing ES by a set of four quantiles, which should allow to make use of backtesting methods for VaR.",预期缺口（ES）作为一种风险度量指标，已被广泛认为在概念上优于风险价值（VaR）。然而与此同时，它也因与回测相关的问题而受到批评。特别是，ES被发现不具备可引出性，这意味着对ES进行回测不如对VaR进行回测那样直接。期望损失被提出作为ES和VaR的潜在更优替代方案。本文重新审视了风险度量普遍认可的理想特性，如一致性、共单调可加性、稳健性和可引出性。我们检验了VaR、ES和期望损失是否具备这些特性，尤其侧重于期望损失。我们还探讨了它们对资本配置的影响，这是风险管理中的一个重要问题。我们发现，尽管ES在估计和回测方面存在注意事项，它仍可被视为一种良好的风险度量。因此，没有足够证据支持在应用中全面用期望损失替代ES。针对ES的回测，我们提出了一种经验方法，即用四个分位数替代ES，这应能利用VaR的回测方法。,Backtesting; Capital Allocation; Coherence; Diversification; Elicitability; Expected Shortfall; Expectile; Forecasts; Probability Integral Transform (PIT); Risk Measure; Risk Management; Robustnes; Value-at-Risk,2013-12-21

risk detection,Materiality and the Length of MisstatementDetectionPeriods,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3521550,Yongtao Hong,"In this paper, I examine if misstatement materiality motivates managers to shorten misstatement detection periods. Following the literature, I find that management shortens the gross detection period by about 116 days for material misstatements than for the immaterial misstatements. The impact of materiality is even more evident for the disclosure of serious (fraud/SEC investigated) than non-serious (error-related) misstatements. In order to reduce the confounding factor – SEC 2004 mandates disclosure of material misstatement within four business days – I estimate net detection periods and find consistently that they are negatively associated with materiality. Additional tests using misstatement severity and cumulative income effect in non-BigR firms as alternative measures of materiality yield consistent results. All three tests alleviate the concern that my finding is mechanical due to the regulatory requirement on disclosure. Further test shows that non-earnings related components of materiality contribute to shorter detection periods as well. Finally, I provide evidence that among material-misstating firms the litigation risk is lower for earlier disclosers than for the later. This finding explains why management would like to shorten the detection period of material misstatement.",本文研究了错报重要性是否促使管理层缩短错报发现周期。根据文献分析，我发现管理层对重要错报的总体发现周期比非重要错报缩短约116天。重要性对严重错报（涉及欺诈/美国证监会调查）披露的影响，较非严重错报（与差错相关）更为显著。为减少混杂因素（2004年SEC规定重要错报须在四个工作日内披露），我测算净发现周期后发现其与重要性始终呈负相关。采用错报严重性及非大额调整公司累计收益影响作为重要性替代指标的额外检验，结果保持一致性。三项检验共同缓解了研究结论可能受监管披露要求机械驱动的疑虑。进一步测试表明，重要性中与非盈利相关的构成要素同样会缩短发现周期。最后，我提供的证据显示，在存在重要错报的公司中，较早披露者的诉讼风险低于较晚披露者。这一发现解释了管理层为何愿意缩短重要错报的发现周期。,"materiality, length of misstatement detection periods, litigation",2020-02-12
risk detection,Machine learning algorithms for DeFiriskassessment,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5171313,Olusegun Adebayo,"Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is rapidly transforming the financial system through provision of decentralized alternatives to traditional financial services. However, the inherent risks that come with DeFi, such as smart contract exploits, liquidity crises, market manipulation, and volatility of cryptocurrency assets, are significant barriers to its adoption. Traditional risk management measures are insufficient due to the decentralized, permissionless, and open nature of DeFi platforms. Hence, machine learning (ML) algorithms have been spoken of as one of the promising solutions for DeFi risk management and assessment automation (Adebayo 2023). This paper presents the application of machine learning techniques to DeFi risk analysis. From huge volumes of data from DeFi protocols, including transaction history, smart contract interactions, market trends, and token price movements, ML models can identify patterns and predict probable risks, e.g., smart contract failure, market crash, and liquidity crisis. We touch upon significant ML models such as supervised learning (e.g., decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines), unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering algorithms), and reinforcement learning and show their usability in risk prediction, anomaly detection, and decision-making within DeFi protocols. Furthermore, pairing the advanced ML models with decentralized oracles and data sources anchored in blockchain technology would make the accuracy and speed of risk assessments stronger to allow continuous monitoring and countering of threats. We briefly address constraints and setbacks related to implementing machine learning within risk management for DeFi, i.e., the issue of the quality of available data, explaining the machine models, and development of DeFi protocols.

risk detection,Deep AnomalyDetectionfor Generalized Face ForgeryDetection,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4644303,Fan Zhang,"Nowadays, the face forgery causes great threat to societal security, hence it is of paramount importance to develop effective countermeasures against it. Though most existing methods adopt neural networks to automatically extract discriminative features for forgery detection and have achieved good results on uncompressed videos, there are still unignorable problems. Namely, when detecting forgery faces generated by unknown forgery methods, the detection performance decreases seriously, which means the generalization capability is poor. To compensate for such limitations, a novel deep anomaly detection for generalized face forgery detection (DAGFD) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the residual artifact map generator optimized by triplet focal loss and metric-softmax loss is first used to locate the fake regions of the compressed videos and amplify the semantic features of the forgery videos. Next, forgery detection is reformulated from the anomaly detection perspective, and the artifact map score is calculated to detect forgery videos. Furthermore, mean square error (MSE) loss is used to minimize the artifact map score of real samples while increase the one of forgery samples to generalize well to unseen forgery methods. Also, circle loss is used for auxiliary classifier to learn more discriminative artifact features. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method’s detection accuracy is better than other state-of-the-art methods.",当前，人脸伪造技术对社会安全构成重大威胁，因此开发有效的应对措施至关重要。尽管现有方法多采用神经网络自动提取区分性特征进行伪造检测，并在未压缩视频上取得良好效果，但仍存在不可忽视的问题：当检测未知伪造方法生成的人脸时，检测性能显著下降，表明其泛化能力不足。为弥补这一缺陷，本文提出了一种新型深度异常检测方法——广义人脸伪造检测框架（DAGFD）。具体而言，首先利用由三元组焦点损失和度量-softmax损失优化的残差伪影图生成器，定位压缩视频的伪造区域并放大伪造视频的语义特征；其次从异常检测角度重构伪造检测任务，通过计算伪影图得分实现伪造视频识别；进一步采用均方误差（MSE）损失最小化真实样本的伪影图得分，同时提升伪造样本得分，以增强对未知伪造方法的泛化能力；此外引入圆形损失辅助分类器学习更具判别力的伪影特征。实验结果表明，所提方法的检测精度优于其他先进技术。,"Anomaly Detection, Face Forgery Detection, Generalization",2023-11-25
risk detection,Reflections on theRiskAnalysis of Nuclear War,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3320920,Seth Baum,"This paper presents reflections on the use of risk analysis for understanding and informing policy decisions about nuclear war. A quantitative evaluation of risk arguably should be central to many important nuclear weapons decisions, such as disarmament and launch alert status, because these decisions involve tradeoffs between different risks. However, nuclear war is a difficult risk to analyze, little effort has been made to analyze it, and nuclear war policy decisions have made little use of risk analysis. The paper demonstrates this via a detailed review of the nuclear war risk literature, a summary of a new model for nuclear war risk produced by the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute, and a discussion of the use of risk analysis in nuclear war decision-making. Despite the challenges, there are significant opportunities for progress on both the analysis and the decision-making. The paper finds that, at this time, the limiting factor is mainly the use of risk analysis for decision-making, such that people working on nuclear war risk should emphasize outreach to decision-makers. The paper’s discussion is of relevance for guiding efforts to understand and reduce nuclear war risk, and is likewise applicable to many other risks, especially other global catastrophic risks.",本文探讨了运用风险分析来理解和指导核战争政策决策的思考。定量风险评估理应成为许多重要核武器决策的核心，例如裁军和发射警戒状态，因为这些决策涉及不同风险之间的权衡。然而，核战争是一种难以分析的风险，相关分析工作鲜有开展，且核战争政策决策也极少运用风险分析。本文通过详细梳理核战争风险文献、总结全球灾难性风险研究所提出的新型核战争风险模型，并讨论风险分析在核战争决策中的应用，对此进行了论证。尽管存在挑战，但在风险分析和决策应用方面仍存在重大发展机遇。研究发现，当前限制因素主要在于决策过程中对风险分析的运用，因此核战争风险研究者应着重加强与决策者的沟通。本文的讨论对指导核战争风险认知与降低工作具有现实意义，其方法论同样适用于其他诸多风险领域，尤其是其他全球性灾难风险。,"nuclear war, risk analysis, global catastrophic risk",2019-02-05

The increase in application complexity outpaces traditional vulnerability detection methods, thus putting security breaches and financial losses within more likely reach. Sophisticated algorithms of Generative AI (Gen AI) help developers identify bugs in their source code while solving these programming issues. The security functions of Gen AI-based automation help developers launch protective measures for their applications ahead of development completion to decrease security risks. Gen AI algorithms process large code libraries to find repeated patterns that indicate dangerous code entries. Gen AI models train through analysis of large datasets that combine secure and insecure code, so they develop a skill for spotting buffer overflows and SQL injection points. Because of this capability, the new code review operations benefit from enhanced vulnerability detection speed and higher accuracy. Gen AI offers developers tools to create remedy suggestions demonstrating safe coding skills suitable for current agile development conditions. The industry demands secure software development, so combining Gen AI with vulnerability detection and risk analysis will establish standard operations within upcoming periods. Research efforts should focus on investing in AI model development to make them ready for use across multiple programming languages and frameworks.

The very extreme nature of global catastrophes makes them both challenging to analyze and important to address. They are challenging to analyze because they are largely unprecedented and because they involve the entire global human system. They are important to address because they threaten everyone around the world and future generations. Global catastrophic risks also pose some deep dilemmas. One dilemma occurs when actions to reduce global catastrophic risk could harm society in other ways, as in the case of geoengineering to reduce catastrophic climate change risk. Another dilemma occurs when reducing one global catastrophic risk could increase another, as in the case of nuclear power reducing climate change risk while increasing risks from nuclear weapons. The complex, interrelated nature of global catastrophic risk suggests a research agenda in which the full space of risks are assessed in an integrated fashion in consideration of the deep dilemmas and other challenges they pose.

In this study, we present a novel application of a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on pseudo-count exploration for network intrusion anomaly detection. We describe how to introduce a pseudo-count exploration (PCE) approach for supervised intrusion anomaly detection based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms and construct an exploration space based on their architecture. For intrusion detection systems (IDSs), setting up dense extrinsic rewards consistent with intrusion detection is very difficult because the identifications are all manual and cannot be automatically identified and these identified intrusion events are stored to form a network feature dataset. We select the NSL-KDD and AWID datasets and compare our proposed new models based on the pseudo-count exploration of double deep Q networks (PCE-DDQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PCE-PPO) with existing machine learning and traditional DRL techniques. It is found that our models significantly outperform the other two types of models in terms of detection performance, especially on the AWID dataset where the anomaly distribution is highly unbalanced. In addition in terms of training cost, our model is faster than the traditional DRL model. We also discuss the effect of discount factor size on the detection ability of the models, and we select Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves as evaluation metrics in addition to the F1 score metrics commonly used for the NSL-KDD and AWID datasets. These two metrics can give a more objective evaluation of the extremely unbalanced dataset, and our models achieve excellent performance on all three types of metrics.",随着网络攻击的增加，网络服务面临的风险问题备受关注，这使得应用新技术提升入侵检测系统性能显得尤为重要。本研究提出了一种基于伪计数探索的深度强化学习算法在网络入侵异常检测中的创新应用。我们阐述了如何将伪计数探索（PCE）方法引入基于深度强化学习（DRL）算法的有监督入侵异常检测，并基于其架构构建探索空间。对于入侵检测系统（IDS）而言，由于所有识别均为人工操作且无法自动完成，这些已识别的入侵事件被存储形成网络特征数据集，因此建立与入侵检测相一致的密集外部奖励机制极为困难。我们选用NSL-KDD和AWID数据集，将提出的基于双深度Q网络伪计数探索（PCE-DDQN）和近端策略优化（PCE-PPO）的新模型与现有机器学习及传统DRL技术进行对比。研究发现，我们的模型在检测性能上显著优于另外两类模型，尤其在异常分布高度不平衡的AWID数据集上表现突出。此外在训练成本方面，我们的模型比传统DRL模型更为高效。我们还探讨了折扣因子大小对模型检测能力的影响，除NSL-KDD和AWID数据集常用的F1分数指标外，额外选取未加权平均召回率（UAR）和受试者工作特征（ROC）曲线作为评估标准。这两项指标能对极端不平衡数据集给出更客观的评价，而我们的模型在全部三类指标上均表现出卓越性能。,"pseudo-count exploration, deep reinforcement learning, Intrusion detection system, Anomaly detection",2023-05-16

Unlike prior work that focused on optimizing sampling strategies, this paper emphasizes the numerical evaluation of CPD algorithms for detecting pest outbreaks using AQIM data. The objective is to assess whether these methods can reliably detect and signal outbreaks when pest arrival rates exceed critical thresholds. Through extensive computational experiments, we compare the accuracy, sensitivity, and robustness of CPD methods under various outbreak scenarios and data conditions. The results demonstrate that CPD techniques, particularly cumulative sum (CUSUM) and exponential moving average (EMA), achieve high detection rates and low false alarm rates, even in challenging settings such as small outbreaks. These findings highlight the feasibility of integrating CPD algorithms into AQIM operations, providing a scalable and practical approach to enhancing outbreak detection and strengthening agricultural biosecurity in the context of global trade and evolving pest risks.",本研究评估了变化点检测（CPD）方法在农业检疫监测（AQIM）项目中的应用，旨在识别有害生物到达率的显著变化。与先前专注于优化采样策略的研究不同，本文着重通过AQIM数据对CPD算法在有害生物暴发检测中的数值评估。研究目标是评估这些方法能否在有害生物到达率超过临界阈值时可靠地检测并预警暴发事件。通过大量计算实验，我们比较了不同暴发场景和数据条件下CPD方法的准确性、灵敏度和稳健性。结果表明，CPD技术（特别是累积和法CUSUM与指数移动平均法EMA）即使在小型暴发等挑战性场景中，仍能实现高检出率和低误报率。这些发现证实了将CPD算法整合到AQIM操作中的可行性，为加强全球贸易和不断演变的害虫风险背景下的暴发检测、提升农业生物安全提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案。,"change point detection, pest outbreak detection, biosecurity, sampling",2025-04-28

This paper offers a robust new method for estimating fraud rate, PRIDIT-FRE (PRIDIT-based Fraud Rate Estimation), developed based on PRIDIT, an unsupervised fraud detection method to assess individual claim fraud suspiciousness. PRIDIT-FRE presents the first nonparametric unsupervised estimator of the actual rate of fraud in a population of claims, robust to the bias contained in the audited sample (arising from the quality or individual hubris of an auditor or investigator, or the natural data gathering process through claims adjusting). PRIDIT-FRE exploits the internal consistency of fraud predictors and makes use of a small audited sample or even an unaudited sample to obtain an estimate of the fraud rate. Using two insurance fraud data sets with different characteristics, we illustrate the effectiveness of PRIDIT-FRE and examine its robustness in varying scenarios.",若想有效管理欺诈行为，必须测量欺诈率以评估问题严重程度及反欺诈技术的有效性。本文提出一种基于PRIDIT（一种评估单个索赔欺诈可疑度的无监督欺诈检测方法）开发的稳健新方法——PRIDIT-FRE（基于PRIDIT的欺诈率估计法）。该方法首次实现了对索赔群体实际欺诈率的无监督非参数估计，能有效克服审计样本中的偏差（这种偏差可能源于审计员或调查员的能力局限、个人主观判断，或理赔调整过程中的自然数据收集流程）。PRIDIT-FRE通过挖掘欺诈预测因子的内在一致性，仅需少量审计样本甚至无需审计样本即可估算欺诈率。我们通过两个特征迥异的保险欺诈数据集，验证了PRIDIT-FRE的有效性，并检验了其在多种场景下的稳健性。,"fraud rate, fraud detection, insurance fraud, unsupervised learning, PRIDIT, PRIDIT-FRE, audit",2011-05-15

The currently used cycling risk assessment methods are limited by their applicability and efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel vision-based cycling risk assessment method. Comparative results on the perceived risk of different cycling events in cycling videos were collected through a comparative survey. Using the Trueskill ranking system, the collected risk comparison results were converted into risk scores. Deep learning was applied to establish the mapping between risk scores and video data to achieve automatic cycling risk assessment. To achieve better model performance, a technology that simulates the human visual attention mechanism, salient object detection, was used to transform the video into forms that are more easily understood by the algorithm. Four models were developed based on different input forms: end-to-end model, saliency map-based model, feature parameter-based model and integrated model. The model results show that the introduction of the attention mechanism has effectively improved the model performance, and the model integrating saliency maps and event feature parameters achieves the best model performance, reaching a prediction accuracy of 0.8125 in the classification of three risk levels.

risk detection,CognitiveRisk,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4007678,James Bone,"The year 2020 will be remembered in history as a realization of systemic risks resulting from human behavior. Risks and opportunity have always emerged from the decisions and behaviors of humans yet for thousands of years the transformation of nature to provide a hospitable environment to live, work and raise a family has never been more acute. The world’s population of almost 8 billion people is transforming at a rapid pace in emerging markets compared to developed markets. By 2050, India’s population is expected to exceed China which is number one today. Nigeria is expected to displace the United States in the number 3 spot followed by Pakistan, Indonesia and Brazil; and Russia #9 today, will fall to #14 in the world.  The shift in population growth will also be reflected in changing demographics as the rich developed countries experience aging populations while the emerging countries rise with younger cohorts. A second major shift is emerging in terms of scarce resources, climate change, technological disruption, the rise of global pandemics, concentrations of wealth, and nationalistic divisions resulting in geopolitical risks. The world is reaching an inflection point in human behavior to either collaborate to solve the world’s problems or devolve into corners to protect diminishing resources we all share – water, clean air, habitable land, etc. In the rise of the “so called”, Fourth Industrial Revolution, the role of human behavior and rational choice is no longer a matter of simple utility maximization it is becoming a choice in survival, literally and figuratively. This new emergent risk we call, Cognitive Risk, a risk that is being shaped in political rhetoric, social media, wealth creation and choice driven by increasingly higher intertemporal discount rates that are inevitably short-sighted.  This paper calls for extensive research to expand knowledge in decision science, behavioral economics, and choice theory in all risk disciplines. Further, the silos of academic research must be broken to become more inclusive with real-life practitioners in diverse fields and disciplines. Access to knowledge is not an exclusive domain where only a few elite schools and researchers have insights. Today technology firms, private research firms and corporations are contributing to insights into decision science. The celebration of advancements by Dan Kahneman and Amos Tversky in Prospect Theory and behavioral economics has become a trickle of practical application of solutions in the real world.

By using the Korean product-level export data and the new NTM data, we find that new trade-restrictive measures in trade can depend on the affected sectors and imposing countries. Exports can be adversely affected by new trade-restrictive measures in their concentrated sectors taken by importing developed countries. We also find the threatening effects of trade remedy before this investigation. However, new trade-restrictive measures imposed by importing developing countries can have positive impact on trade, particularly an increase in consumers’ trust in product quality and decrease in asymmetric information.

The traditional gravity equation model estimates the net effect of these measures on international trade with a loss of useful inference on separate effects. We stipulate a generalized gravity equation model to disentangle the two effects. We apply the augmented approach to agricultural trade among OECD countries in 2004. We find that technical measures in agriculture often jointly enhance import demand and hinder export supply with the net effect of promoting the propensity to trade.

We distinguish 'direct' from 'indirect' approaches. The direct approach collects observable data or proxy variables on trade cost components which are then typically used as regressors in a gravity equation of trade. Instead, the indirect approach infers the extent of trade impediments from trade flows. It compares actual trade flows to the trade flows predicted by a hypothetical frictionless benchmark scenario based on a micro-founded trade model, attributing the deviation of actual from predicted trade flows to trade frictions. We argue that economists and policymakers can gain useful insights from both approaches.","本文回顾了有关国际贸易中贸易成本测算的文献，特别关注非关税措施，尤其是标准与技术法规。我们区分了""直接""与""间接""两种研究方法。直接法通过收集贸易成本构成要素的可观测数据或代理变量，通常将其作为贸易引力方程中的回归变量；而间接法则从贸易流量反推贸易障碍程度，通过将实际贸易流量与基于微观基础贸易模型构建的无摩擦基准情景下的预测值进行对比，将二者偏差归因于贸易摩擦。我们认为经济学家与政策制定者可从两种方法中获取有益洞见。","Gravity, Measurement, Nontariff Measures, Product Standards, Technical Barriers to Trade, Technical Regulations, Trade Costs",2012-04-04

However, simultaneously there has been an increase in non tariff measures (NTMs) notified to the WTO. Within this category they are technical barriers to trade (TBT) and sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS). The increasing importance of these requirements highlights the need to attend to the effects that SPS/TBT measures have on the flow of imports and exports. In order to address this matter, a literature review was made to consider the latest research in the field specifically in the case of food and agricultural sector. Finally, as an overall result the existence of a “dual” effect was shown regarding the relationship between SPS/TBT and food and agricultural international trade which depends on the trade-off between implementation costs and the benefits of a better positioning in an gradually more demanding market.","过去几十年间，全球国际贸易呈现出显著开放的特征，这主要得益于关税的降低。然而与此同时，向世界贸易组织(WTO)通报的非关税措施(NTMs)却有所增加，其中技术性贸易壁垒(TBT)和卫生与植物检疫措施(SPS)尤为突出。这些要求日益凸显的重要性，使得关注SPS/TBT措施对进出口流量的影响变得必要。为此，本文通过文献综述探讨了该领域的最新研究，特别是针对食品和农业部门的研究。最终总体结果表明：SPS/TBT与食品及农产品国际贸易之间存在""双重""效应，这种效应取决于实施成本与在日益严苛市场中获取更有利地位所带来的收益之间的权衡。","Food trade, agricultural trade, technical barriers to trade, TBT, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, SPS, technical regulations",2015-06-06

There has been less attention paid to the role of standards as a form of protectionism, despite the introduction of Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (‘TBT Agreement’) on 15 April 1994. Stated as an objective, the TBT Agreement is to ensure that no unnecessary obstacles to international trade are created. While governments in the past have relied upon high tariffs and quotas imposed on imports to protect local industries or discriminate against foreign-produced goods, less transparent measures – referred to as non-tariff barriers – are now becoming more prominent.

This study is to analyze and better understand TBT or more accurately, technical measures. Based on the analysis, it will attempt to identify some implications and ways to reduce TBT or to facilitate international trade, and ultimately contribute to enhancing economic integration in the Asia-Pacific region. The characteristics and trends of technical measures can be best identified and evaluated by the notifications of WTO members according to the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement), discussions in the WTO TBT Committee - especially specific trade concerns (STCs), and dispute settlement cases in TBT related issues. In fact, the number of TBT notifications have surged as various and comprehensive legitimate objectives of technical regulations were allowed and on other backgrounds since the launch of the WTO in 1995. It is noted, however, that TBT notifications are not regarded as TBT itself but as “potential” TBTs in this study. To analyze the trends and characteristics of TBT measures, this study utilizes the information in the WTO TBT notifications, STCs, and dispute settlement cases related to the TBT Agreement. Focus will be on the APEC member economies. Some trends and characteristics of TBT measures by the objective of regulation, by commodity, and by the country notified (e.g., developed and developing economies) will be analyzed and identified. Some of implications from the results are as follows. Due to the fact that technical measures are mostly domestic regulations but controlled at the border to restrict market access, there needs to be consultation, cooperation and harmonization of regulation rather than competition and retaliation. There also needs to be developed a system for information and experience exchange, capacity building including on development and implementation of standards, technical regulation, and conformity assessment procedures, especially for developing economies.

The purpose of these requirements may be the protection of life or health, the protection of the environment, the prevention of deceptive practices or to ensure the quality of products. These requirements may constitute formidable barriers to trade. Moreover, procedures set up to verify whether a product meets certain requirements may obstruct trade. These barriers to trade are referred to as technical barriers to trade. One must distinguish between:   the general category of technical barriers to trade, for which rules have been set out in the TBT Agreement; and    a special category of technical barriers to trade, namely sanitary and phytosanitary measures, for which rules are provided in the SPS Agreement. The rules of the TBT Agreement and the SPS Agreement are of great importance to international trade.

Yet, at the same time there has been a notable increase in the use of non-tariff measures (NTM) for many products in most countries. In this environment, technical barriers to trade (TBT)—a sub-category of NTM and one of the main obstacles to trade—are crucial factors firms must take into consideration when exporting goods. Since Korea relies largely on exports for economic growth, it is necessary for the government to understand the economic impact of TBT.One of the main objectives of the EU is to prevent the erection of trade barriers within its borders. It follows that the coordination of technical regulations among EU member states is of a vital importance. The EU currently employs two main approaches to coordination : Harmonization (HR) and Mutual Recognition (MR). In harmonized fields, all member states agree to adopt uniform technical regulations.The European Union is Korea’s third-largest trading partner by volume, after China and the U.S. In addition, it plays a leading role in the design and implementation of new TBT that are consequently adopted by many other countries. In this paper, I analyze the impact of the EU’s TBT on Korean exports. In particular, I study the impact under the EU’s various approaches to removing TBT among member countries.",过去二十年间，由于《关税与贸易总协定》（GATT）体系的扩展，关税和配额等传统贸易壁垒的使用已逐渐减少。然而与此同时，多数国家对众多产品采取的非关税措施（NTM）却显著增加。在此背景下，作为非关税措施子类目和主要贸易障碍之一的技术性贸易壁垒（TBT），成为企业出口商品时必须考量的关键因素。由于韩国经济增长高度依赖出口，政府有必要理解技术性贸易壁垒的经济影响。欧盟的主要目标之一是防止其内部设立贸易壁垒，因此成员国间技术法规的协调至关重要。欧盟目前采用两种主要协调方式：统一化（HR）与相互认可（MR）。在统一化领域，所有成员国同意采用完全一致的技术法规。欧盟是韩国继中国和美国之后的第三大贸易伙伴，同时在新技术性贸易壁垒的设计与实施方面发挥着主导作用，这些壁垒随后被众多其他国家采纳。本文分析了欧盟技术性贸易壁垒对韩国出口的影响，重点研究了欧盟采用不同方法消除成员国间技术性贸易壁垒时所产生的效应。,"non-tariff measures, NTMs, technical barriers to trade, TBTs, EU TBTs, EU-Korea trade, harmonization, mutual recognition, global trade, free trade, trade policy, trade agreements, EU, Korea",2022-12-29
technical trade measures,Proliferation of Non-TariffMeasuresin China – Their Relevance for ASEAN,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1950462,Evelyn Shyamala Devadason,"This paper explores the various non-tariff measures (NTMs) that co-exist in China and that directly influence imports into the country. Given the intensity and scope of technical measures imposed by China, the directional impacts of technical barriers to trade (TBTs) on bilateral ASEAN-China exports are investigated empirically using an augmented gravity model. The results imply that Chinese TBTs do have some trade depressing effects from the ASEAN perspective. However, sectoral trade effects of TBTs are important as dual effects exist even within some TBT intensive product groups. This informs the policy debate on the effects of NTMs from the ASEAN-China perspective more specifically, and the “South-South” context more generally on two fronts. First, the identification of specific trade restricting meaures for the affected sectors will assist in determining policy priorities within the ASEAN-China context. Second, trade facilitation measures that increase the business costs to the ASEAN exporters also warrant attention in addressing the scale of market access issues in China.","本文探讨了中国并存且直接影响进口的各类非关税措施(NTMs)。鉴于中国实施技术措施的强度与广度，研究采用扩展引力模型实证检验了技术性贸易壁垒(TBTs)对东盟-中国双边出口的定向影响。结果表明，从东盟视角看，中国的TBTs确实存在一定的贸易抑制效应。但TBTs的行业贸易效应具有重要性，因为即便在某些TBT密集型产品类别中也存在双重效应。这从两个层面为政策讨论提供了更具体的东盟-中国视角及更广义的""南南合作""背景下的NTMs影响分析：首先，识别受影响行业的具体贸易限制措施将有助于确定东盟-中国框架下的政策优先事项；其次，那些增加东盟出口商商业成本的贸易便利化措施，在解决中国市场准入规模问题时同样值得关注。","Non-Tariff Measures (NTMs), Technical Barriers to Trade (TBTs), Gravity Model, China, ASEAN",2011-10-28

We focus on standard-like measures such as technical barriers and sanitary and phytosanitary regulations. The approach overcomes the shortcomings of the mainstream approach based on the analysis of forgone trade caused by trade costs. The latter ignores market imperfections: welfare increases when NTMs are removed and trade expands. We explain how to account for external effects and market failures in trade-focused welfare analysis, leading to a more balanced overall assessment of measures despite a potential reduction of trade flows. We show that the relationship between trade, welfare, and NTMs is complex. The optimum NTM is often not zero. An application to shrimp trade illustrates the feasibility of the proposed approach. The illustration shows that the reinforcement of a food safety standard can be socially preferable to the status-quo situation, both domestically and internationally.",本文提出了一种基于福利的系统性方法，用于分析存在市场缺陷时非关税措施（NTMs）对贸易和福利的影响。我们重点关注技术性贸易壁垒、卫生与植物检疫法规等类标准措施。该方法克服了主流研究通过贸易成本分析所造成贸易损失这一路径的缺陷——后者忽视了市场缺陷的存在，简单认为取消非关税措施扩大贸易就能提升福利。我们阐述了如何在以贸易为核心的福利分析中纳入外部效应和市场失灵因素，从而对政策措施做出更全面的整体评估，即便这可能减少贸易流量。研究表明，贸易、福利与非关税措施之间存在复杂关联，最优非关税措施水平通常不为零。以虾类贸易为例的实证研究验证了本方法的可行性，该案例表明强化食品安全标准无论在国内还是国际层面，都可能成为比维持现状更具社会效益的选择。,"Non-tariff measures, externality, trade, welfare, NTM",2011-01-25

This article examines the dynamics behind and the implications of the turn to renewable energy safeguards for the global effort to accelerate the development and deployment of renewable energy technologies in light of the recent WTO Panel report on US – Safeguard Measure on PV Products. The article makes three interrelated arguments. First, the WTO jurisprudence on renewable energy support measures and rapidly evolving global value chains in renewable energy technologies helped spur the turn to safeguard measures.

We show that the negative effect of TBT on export participation is magnified for multi-destination firms, which can divert their exports towards TBT-free destinations. Moreover, we conduct aggregate level estimations to show that the effect of stringent TBTs in reducing export ows is magnified in more homogeneous sectors.

This rises to approximately 30 percent if land clearance for farming, agrochemical production and trade in agricultural and food products are attributed to the sector. Market based mechanisms (carbon tax, cap and trade, payment for environmental services) and voluntary mitigation measures (carbon labeling and food miles) are reviewed for their effectiveness (if they reduce emissions), efficiency (the costs of the measures) and equity (fairness to suppliers). Measures to reduce agricultural emissions are limited in their effectiveness and efficiency by the technical difficulty and high costs of measuring, reporting and verification. However, pricing carbon would be effective in internalizing negative externalities in the transport, processing, retail and consumer purchase and preparation of food. The GTAP model is used to illustrate that a US $40 carbon tax implemented in the EU would have little negative impact on developing country exporters of agricultural products due to their low carbon intensity.

Second, it shows how technical progress and international trade give two more reasons for the same objection, which, though logically independent, only became apparent because of the first.From these it follows that neither technical progress nor international trade can be plausibly described or explained if capital goods are not treated as heterogeneous goods manufactured with the use of capital goods.

Our paper offers an analysis of the structure and the importance of these measures in agricultural trade. We cover all notifying countries and products at the HS6 digit level. Results of the inventory approach show that EU countries have the lowest coverage ratios of all OECD countries except South Korea and Turkey. Using gravity equation, we also estimate the stringency of such measures. In contrast with previous works, our equation controls for the bilateral applied tariff protection and uses ad valorem equivalents of SPS and TBT measures. Our results first suggest that these measures have on the whole a negative impact on OECD imports. When we consider different groups of exporting countries, we show that OECD exporters are not significantly affected by SPS and TBTs in their exports to other OECD countries while developing and least developed countries' exports are negatively and significantly affected. Furthermore, EU imports seem to be more negatively influenced by tariffs and SPS & TBTs than imports of other OECD countries. Finally, our sectoral analysis suggests an equal distribution of negative and positive impacts of NTBs on agricultural trade.",根据世贸组织规则，各国可依据《卫生与植物检疫措施协定》（SPS）和《技术性贸易壁垒协定》（TBT）制定法规，以保护人类、动植物健康及环境、野生动植物和人类安全。本文分析了这些措施在农产品贸易中的结构及重要性，涵盖所有通报国及HS六位码商品。清单分析法结果显示，除韩国和土耳其外，欧盟国家在经合组织中的措施覆盖率最低。通过引力模型，我们还评估了此类措施的严格程度。与既往研究不同，本模型控制了双边适用关税保护水平，并采用SPS与TBT措施的从价税等值。研究首先表明，这些措施总体上对经合组织进口呈负面影响。按出口国分组分析显示，经合组织成员对同体系国家的出口未受SPS与TBT显著影响，而发展中国家和最不发达国家出口则遭受显著负面冲击。此外，欧盟进口受关税及SPS与TBT的负面影响较其他经合组织国家更为显著。最后，部门分析表明非关税壁垒对农业贸易的负面与正面影响分布均衡。,"agriculture, sanitary and phyto-sanitary norms, technical barriers to trade",2008-08-04
technical trade measures,The Economic Effects of Standards Harmonization between Technologically Asymmetric Countries,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4203131,Han Eol Ryu,"Since trade liberalization started in earnest in the 1990s, conventional trade barriers, such as tariffs, have been dropping steadily worldwide. Under the WTO regime, member countries are unable to impose tariff higher than set rates, and effective tariff rates have been decreasing consistently as a result. In addition, the spread of multilateral and bilateral trade agreements has accelerated this phenomenon. It follows that many governments have begun to use non-tariff measures (NTMs), such as technological measures, standards, and intellectual property rights, as strategic trade policies. The variety and volume of NTMs have increased.According to Annex 1.2 of the WTO's TBT Agreement, ""standards"" refer to “document approved by a recognized body, that provides, for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for products or related processes and production methods, with which compliance is not mandatory.”Standards are intended primarily to improve the compatibility and quality of products and reinforce consumer protection, but may serve as de facto trade barriers that prevent foreign corporations from entering the domestic market and protect domestic businesses, whether the domestic governments intend it or not. The U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and Regulations (FMVSS) gives a good example of using standards as trade barriers. In most countries, vehicles are produced according to international safety standards called the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), which are accepted in just about every country in the world except the US and Canada. Foreign automakers, who already produce their products under UNECE and wish to export them to the U.S. and Canada, must satisfy the FMVSS and thus must modify their UNECE-compliance models. This then creates additional costs for the foreign firms, who already face stiff competition from American firms in the U.S. market.This paper models the effects of standards harmonization between countries with different technological capacities. Standards harmonization is effectively a way of eliminating standards as a NTM trade barrier.","自20世纪90年代贸易自由化真正开始以来，全球范围内的关税等传统贸易壁垒持续下降。在世贸组织框架下，成员国不得征收超过设定税率的关税，因此实际关税税率持续走低。此外，多边和双边贸易协定的普及加速了这一趋势。这使得许多政府开始将技术性措施、标准、知识产权等非关税措施（NTM）作为战略性贸易政策，其种类和数量与日俱增。. . 根据世贸组织《技术性贸易壁垒协定》附件1.2的定义，""标准""指""经公认机构批准的、规定产品或相关工艺和生产方法的规则、指南或特性的文件，要求共同和重复使用，其合规性并非强制""。标准的主要目的是提高产品兼容性和质量、加强消费者保护，但无论政府初衷如何，都可能成为事实上的贸易壁垒，阻碍外资企业进入国内市场并保护本土企业。. . 美国《联邦机动车安全标准与法规》（FMVSS）就是标准作为贸易壁垒的典型案例。多数国家采用联合国欧洲经济委员会（UNECE）制定的国际安全标准生产汽车，该标准被除美加以外的全球各国普遍接受。已按UNECE标准生产汽车的外国制造商若想出口美加市场，必须满足FMVSS要求，这意味着需对符合UNECE标准的车型进行改造。这给本就面临美国本土企业激烈竞争的外国车企增加了额外成本。. . 本文构建了技术能力存在差异的国家间标准协调效应模型。标准协调实质上是消除标准作为非关税贸易壁垒的一种方式。","tariffs, technical barriers to trade, TBTs, non-tariff measures, NTMs, trade liberalization, trade protectionism, global trade, trade strategy, trade policy, standardization",2022-12-23
technical trade measures,UnilateralMeasuresAdressing Non-TradeConcerns,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1021946,P. van den Bossche,"The Netherlands is highly dependent on international trade for its  economic prosperity. Successive Dutch governments have, therefore, always supported the further liberalization of international trade. At the same time, the public debate on economic globalization and international trade reveals that citizens as well as policy makers fear the corrosive impact of international trade on the core societal values on which Dutch society is founded. They fear that international trade, in particular a further liberalization thereof, may undermine or put at risk policies and measures for the protection of public health, the environment, labour rights, social welfare, good governance, national security, cultural identity, food safety, access to knowledge, consumer interests and animal welfare. There is a general consensus in the Netherlands that these non-trade concerns (NTC's), which cover very different societal aspirations and fears, must be addressed in Dutch government policy and measures relating to international trade. Many of the trade measures introduced by developed countries to address non-trade concerns have been met by developing countries with much suspicion and opposition. Developing countries often suspect that such measures are inspired by protectionist motives and intentions, rather than genuine non-trade concerns. Moreover, developing countries perceive these measures as an attempt by developed countries to impose their social, ethical or cultural values and preferences on exporting developing countries. Over the last two years, the debate in the Netherlands on trade measures addressing non-trade concerns has focused on two important and politically sensitive issues, namely:   the sustainability of the large-scale production of biomass as an alternative source of energy; and   the production of livestock products in a manner that is consistent with animal welfare requirements. With regard to the first issue  sustainable biomass production  in February 2007 the Project Group Duurzame Productie van Biomassa, a commission established by the government and chaired by Jacqueline Cramer (hereinafter the 'Cramer Commission'), issued a report on the Toetsingskader voor Duurzame Biomassa (hereinafter the 'Cramer Report'). This report discusses the risks associated with large-scale biomass production and establishes a list of criteria for the sustainable production of biomass. These criteria (hereinafter the 'Cramer sustainability criteria') reflect a broad range of non-trade concerns, including environmental protection, global warming, food security, biodiversity, economic prosperity and social welfare. The Cramer Report invites the Dutch government to give effect to the Cramer sustainability criteria by incorporating them into relevant policy. The report recognizes, however, that the implementation of the Cramer sustainability criteria (including the establishment of a certification system) will require careful consideration of the obligations of the Netherlands under EU and WTO law. With regard to the second issue  animal welfare  modern methods of intensive agricultural production have generated, especially in Europe, increased concern about the treatment of farm animals, in particular with regard to their housing, nutrition, transportation and slaughter. Individual EU Member States, including the Netherlands, as well the EU itself, have adopted wide-ranging animal welfare legislation. Governments called upon to address non-trade concerns may do so by using different types of measures. Prominent among these are measures concerning processes and production methods of products. These measures may concern either:   product-related processes and production methods (PR PPMs), i.e. measures that prescribe processes and production methods that affect the characteristics of products (e.g. measures prohibiting the use of growth hormones for cattle in the production of meat, or prohibiting the use of pesticides in the production of vegetables); or   non-product-related processes and production methods (nPR PPMs), i.e. measures that prescribe processes and production methods that do not, or in a negligible manner only, affect the characteristics of the products (e.g. a measure requiring that tuna fishing vessels use dolphin-friendly nets). The second type of measure, i.e. measures concerning nPR PPMs, is  much more than measures concerning PR PPMs  the subject of controversy. Pursuant to its terms of reference, this study therefore focuses on three main issues relating to unilateral non-product-related PPM measures addressing non-trade concerns, namely:   the consistency of unilateral nPR PPM measures addressing non-trade concerns with the obligations under the WTO Agreement (see Part 1);   the relevance of other international agreements for unilateral nPR PPM measures addressing non-trade concerns (see Part 2); and    the economic effectiveness and efficiency, as well as the impact on developing countries, of unilateral nPR PPM measures addressing non-trade concerns. In the present study, these issues are examined primarily with regard to existing, proposed or still purely hypothetical measures for implementing the Cramer criteria for the sustainable production of biomass, or measures for the protection and promotion of animal welfare.","荷兰的经济繁荣高度依赖国际贸易。因此，历届荷兰政府始终支持进一步推动国际贸易自由化。与此同时，关于经济全球化与国际贸易的公共讨论显示，民众和政策制定者都担忧国际贸易会侵蚀荷兰社会赖以建立的核心价值观。他们担心国际贸易——尤其是进一步自由化——可能损害或危及旨在保护公共卫生、环境、劳工权利、社会福利、良政、国家安全、文化认同、食品安全、知识获取、消费者利益及动物福利的政策措施。荷兰社会普遍共识认为，这些涵盖多元社会诉求与忧虑的非贸易关切事项（NTC's），必须在政府涉及国际贸易的政策与措施中得到处理。. . 发达国家为应对非贸易关切出台的许多贸易措施，常引发发展中国家的强烈质疑与反对。发展中国家往往认为这些措施源于保护主义动机，而非真正的非贸易关切，并视其为发达国家试图将自身社会、伦理或文化价值观强加于出口型发展中国家。过去两年间，荷兰国内关于应对非贸易关切的贸易措施争论聚焦于两大政治敏感议题：一是作为替代能源的大规模生物质生产的可持续性；二是符合动物福利要求的畜产品生产方式。. . 针对生物质可持续生产议题，2007年2月，由政府设立、杰奎琳·克拉默（以下简称""克拉默委员会""）领导的""可持续生物质生产项目组""发布了《可持续生物质认证框架》报告（以下简称《克拉默报告》）。该报告分析了大规模生物质生产的风险，并制定了一套可持续生产标准（以下简称""克拉默可持续标准""），涵盖环境保护、全球变暖、粮食安全、生物多样性、经济繁荣及社会福利等广泛非贸易关切。报告建议政府将标准纳入相关政策，但强调实施过程（包括认证体系建立）需审慎考量荷兰在欧盟与WTO框架下的义务。. . 关于动物福利议题，现代农业集约化生产方式（尤其在欧洲）引发对农场动物待遇的深切关注，涉及饲养、运输、屠宰等环节。荷兰等欧盟成员国及欧盟层面已通过综合性动物福利立法。. . 政府处理非贸易关切时可采取不同类型措施，其中关于产品加工与生产方法（PPMs）的措施尤为突出。这类措施分为两类：一是影响产品特性的生产加工方法（PR PPMs），如禁止肉类生产使用生长激素或蔬菜种植使用农药；二是不影响（或可忽略影响）产品特性的生产加工方法（nPR PPMs），如要求金枪鱼捕捞船使用海豚友好型渔网。后者比前者更具争议性。. . 本研究据此聚焦于单边非产品相关PPM措施应对非贸易关切的三大核心问题：一是此类措施与WTO协定义务的一致性（见第一部分）；二是其他国际协定对此类措施的相关性（见第二部分）；三是此类措施的经济效能及对发展中国家的影响。研究主要结合实施克拉默生物质可持续标准（现有/拟议/假设性措施）及动物福利保护措施展开分析。","Non-Trade Concerns, International Trade, WTO",2007-10-17

The assessment is illustrated by a number of cases that have tested the limits of legal provisions in the WTO and EU dealing with issues arising at the intersection of trade liberalization and environmental protection such as the maintenance of domestic health, safety and environmental standards and cross-border activity. The conclusions of the paper point to a trend towards the regionalization of trade and environment rule making and implementation, with the EU moving along its distinctive policy making path, and the GATT/WTO barely moving at all. The paper demonstrates the limitations of judicial and quasi-judicial means of dealing with trade measures for non-trade purposes and argues for approaching the legitimacy of such measures through the lens of process rather than outcome, expanding participation and interest representation in national and international decision- and policy-making.",本文评估了世界贸易组织（WTO）和欧盟中出于环境目的采取贸易措施的范围及其影响。评估通过一系列案例加以说明，这些案例检验了WTO和欧盟法律条款在处理贸易自由化与环境保护交叉问题（如维护国内健康、安全与环境标准以及跨境活动）时的界限。论文的结论指出，贸易与环境规则制定及实施呈现区域化趋势——欧盟正沿着其独特的政策制定路径推进，而关贸总协定/WTO则几乎停滞不前。研究揭示了通过司法和准司法手段处理非贸易目的贸易措施的局限性，并主张应从程序而非结果的角度审视此类措施的合法性，同时扩大国家和国际决策及政策制定过程中的参与度与利益代表性。,"Trade measures, environmental protection, economic integration, environmental standards, extra-territoriality, national treatment, mutual recognition, dispute settlement, rule making and implementation, GATT/WTO, European Union",2001-10-14
technical trade measures,Tradein Goods Under the EU–Korea FTA: Market Access and RegulatoryMeasures,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2159600,Boris Rigod,"This chapter deals with the rules on trade in goods in the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement. It is organized, as follows. First, the rules on market access, that is, the EU-Korea FTA provisions related to import measures applicable at the border, will be delineated and analyzed. Subsequently, aspects of one of the most innovative parts of the agreement will be examined in detail: the section containing rules on domestic regulation, in particular, on technical regulations and standards. This paper shows two sides of the EU–Korea FTA. On the one hand, it is a very traditional trade agreement, largely based on existing WTO provisions. This is particularly the case in those parts of the agreement concerning border measures. On the other hand, in particular, concerning the sector-specific rules on technical barriers to trade, the agreement is quite innovative and breaks new grounds, with respect to the regulation of domestic instruments. Moreover, the Agreement is, to a large extent, a ‘living instrument’. Many of the remaining lacunae in the field of domestic regulation must be dealt with in the future, through cooperation and consultations within the different committees and working groups. This is the Agreement’s approach to tackle its endogenous incompleteness, which is inherent in any trade agreement. From this angle, the EU–Korea FTA may not only be understood as a static body of rules, but also as a framework for collaboration that helps to find prompt and appropriate responses to changes in real-world conditions, thus facilitating trade relations between the parties in the long run.","本章探讨《欧盟-韩国自由贸易协定》中关于货物贸易的规则，内容安排如下：首先将界定并分析市场准入规则，即协定中与边境进口措施相关的条款。随后将详细研究该协定最具创新性的部分之一——涉及国内监管规则的内容，特别是技术法规与标准的相关规定。. . 本文揭示了《欧盟-韩国自贸协定》的双重特性。一方面，这是一份高度传统的贸易协定，其主要条款基于现行世贸组织规则，这在涉及边境措施的部分尤为明显。另一方面，该协定在技术性贸易壁垒的行业特定规则方面颇具创新性，为国内监管工具的规范开辟了新路径。此外，该协定在很大程度上属于""动态文件""，国内监管领域尚存的诸多空白需通过各委员会和工作组未来的合作与磋商来填补。这种机制正是协定应对其内生不完整性的解决之道——这种不完整性是所有贸易协定与生俱来的特质。. . 从这个角度看，《欧盟-韩国自贸协定》不仅可视为静态的规则体系，更是一个促进合作的框架。它有助于双方对现实条件变化作出迅速而恰当的应对，从而长远地巩固双边贸易关系。","EU-Korea FTA, trade in goods, regulatory measures",2012-10-10
technical trade measures,IPv6 AAAA DNS Whitelisting,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2701509,BITAG Technical Working Group,"Executive Summary: Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the new form of addressing for the Internet. IPv6 is being deployed as a result of the exhaustion of the supply of the older form of addressing, Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4). The Internet is now beginning a global transition from IPv4 to IPv6, although most websites and networks will run both address families in parallel for many years. This document describes the emerging practice of Internet web sites (or, more broadly, “Internet domains”), such as example.com, selectively returning IPv6-related resources from Domain Name System (DNS) servers. As a result, the domain can enable or disable a network (and, as a consequence, that network’s users) from accessing the domain’s content over IPv6. This practice is known as “DNS Whitelisting” and is intended as a means to smooth the global transition from IPv4 to IPv6. DNS Whitelisting was first used by major web content sites. These web site operators observed that when they added IPv6 records to their DNS servers in order to support IPv6 access to their content, a fraction of end users had slow or otherwise impaired access to this content. Major domains are motivated by a desire to maintain a high-quality user experience for all of their users, as well as to shift traffic to IPv6 in a controlled manner. Thus, domains engaging in DNS Whitelisting are attempting to shield users with impaired access from the symptoms of those impairments until they can be remedied. Those domains are also interested in having a degree of control over their own migration to IPv6 that they would otherwise lack without DNS Whitelisting, so that IPv6 traffic can be added gradually as IPv6 operations and network practices mature. At the same time, critics of the practice have articulated a range of technical and non-technical concerns and are focused on ensuring that DNS Whitelisting, when implemented, is done in a manner that is transparent, non-discriminatory, and not anti-competitive. Generally speaking, a domain that implements DNS Whitelisting does so manually. This means that the domain manually maintains a list of networks that are permitted to receive IPv6 records (via their DNS resolver IP addresses) and that these networks typically submit applications in order to be added to the DNS Whitelist. Domain operators foresee that a second phase of DNS Whitelisting may emerge in the future, possibly in the near future. In this new phase a domain would return IPv6 and/or IPv4 records dynamically based on automatically detected technical capabilities, location, or other factors. It would then function much like (or as part of) global server load balancing, a common suite of practices already in use today. Furthermore, in this second phase, networks might be added to and removed from a DNS Whitelist automatically, and possibly on a near-real-time basis. This means that networks may no longer need to apply to be added to a whitelist, which could alleviate some of the issues addressed herein. Since this future phase has yet to emerge, this document and its suggestions apply only to the DNS Whitelisting practices currently known to the BITAG. The BITAG reserves its opinion on future alternative practices until they can be articulated and evaluated. Although current implementations are not perceived to have this impact, the BITAG is interested in this issue on that grounds that, without careful and monitored deployment, some whitelisting services could in the future be viewed as anti-competitive, discriminatory or in violation of some other public policy objective. The practice may be viewed as controversial and the manner in which it is employed could result in concerns or complaints. As a result, it is important to inform the public and policymakers about why DNS Whitelisting is used and how it functions, to identify concerns surrounding its use, and to outline some potential implementation steps that domains could take to minimize the risk of complaints and controversy. The BITAG has formulated a set of suggested practices regarding the implementation of DNS Whitelisting to help reduce such complaints, acknowledging that practices may vary as a domain moves from experimentation with whitelisting and IPv6 to a point of operational stability.","执行摘要：互联网协议第六版（IPv6）是新一代互联网寻址形式。由于旧版寻址协议IPv4地址资源枯竭，IPv6正逐步部署。尽管大多数网站和网络将在未来多年并行支持两种地址体系，全球互联网已开始从IPv4向IPv6过渡。本文阐述了互联网域名（如example.com）通过域名系统（DNS）服务器选择性返回IPv6相关资源的新兴实践。该机制使得域名管理者能按需控制特定网络（及该网络用户）通过IPv6访问内容的能力，这种被称为""DNS白名单""的技术旨在平滑全球IPv6过渡进程。. . DNS白名单最初由大型内容网站采用。这些运营商发现，当他们在DNS服务器添加IPv6记录以支持IPv6访问时，部分终端用户会出现访问延迟或质量下降的情况。主要域名运营商既希望维持所有用户的高质量体验，又需要可控地迁移IPv6流量，因此通过白名单机制暂时隔离存在访问障碍的用户，直至问题解决。该技术也使运营商能自主掌控IPv6迁移节奏，随着IPv6运营和网络实践的成熟逐步增加流量。. . 批评者则从技术与非技术层面提出诸多质疑，强调白名单实施过程应保持透明、非歧视且不违反公平竞争原则。当前白名单主要通过人工维护：运营商手动管理允许接收IPv6记录的网络列表（基于其DNS解析器IP地址），相关网络通常需提交申请才能加入白名单。业界预期未来可能出现第二阶段演进——基于自动检测的技术能力、地理位置等因素动态返回IPv6/IPv4记录，其功能将类似于（或作为）当前已广泛应用的全局服务器负载均衡系统。在此阶段，网络可能实现近实时自动增减白名单，从而缓解现行机制的部分问题。. . 鉴于第二阶段尚未成形，本文建议仅针对BITAG已知的现行白名单实践。BITAG对尚未明确的未来实践持保留意见。虽然目前未发现负面影响，但BITAG关注到若缺乏审慎部署，某些白名单服务可能在未来被视为反竞争、歧视性或违背公共政策目标。该技术可能存在争议，其应用方式可能引发担忧。因此有必要向公众和政策制定者阐明DNS白名单的应用原理，识别潜在问题，并列举可减少争议的实施建议。. . BITAG制定了一套实施建议，帮助降低争议风险，同时承认随着域名运营商从IPv6试验阶段过渡到稳定运营阶段，具体实践可能存在差异。","IPv6, whitelisting, internet, networking, whitelisting, BITAG, multistakeholder, open internet, net neutrality",2016-01-14

technical trade measures,IPv6 Large Scale Network Address Translation (NAT),https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2701488,BITAG Technical Working Group,"Executive Summary: The Internet is running out of addresses in the format in which they were originally standardized, known as IPv4, due to aspects of that format which constrain the address space to a relatively “small” number of unique addresses as compared to the burgeoning number of devices requiring those same addresses to function on the Internet. A successor address format, IPv6, has been developed to support as many devices as can conceivably be connected to the Internet for the foreseeable future. While the global transition to IPv6 is in progress, it is going to take a number of years to upgrade all Internet applications and services, consumer electronics devices, and networks to support IPv6. The transition period is also likely to be lengthy given that, among other things, IPv4-only equipment is still being manufactured and sold to consumers. As network operators deploy IPv6 technology into their existing IPv4 networks, IPv4 and IPv6 will thus need to co-exist until the demand for IPv4 services diminishes. Given the amount of time it may take to migrate out of a pure IPv4, or mixed IPv4 and IPv6 network environment, to pure IPv6 service, network operators are employing a variety of techniques to extend the life of IPv4 addressing. One such technique is the use of Large Scale Network Address Translation (also known as Large Scale NAT or LSN). LSN equipment allows a large number of IPv4-enabled end devices to share a single public IPv4 address. Network Address Translation (NAT) functionality has long existed in local/private networks to help network operators manage their network addresses using private address space. NAT functionality is known to adversely impact some Internet applications; wider use of NAT as part of LSN therefore deserves careful examination. The BITAG is interested in LSN given that IP address sharing is a key tool for extending the life of IPv4 during the transition to IPv6.  LSN is likely to affect many players in the Internet ecosystem: ISPs, end users, application providers, equipment vendors, content delivery networks, and third parties such as law enforcement agencies. A broad understanding of problems that may arise has the following benefits: (1) it will help stakeholders to prepare for actions that minimize the impact on end users and applications; (2) it will inform policymakers and regulators of the motivations and trade-offs for the deployment of this technology; (3) it will accelerate the transition to IPv6; and (4) it will more generally help to reduce or preclude friction and/or conflict surrounding use of this technique among stakeholders, as some have argued that Large Scale NAT could be abused by parties for anti-competitive, discriminatory, or other non-technical purposes. LSN Deployments and Impacts: LSN will be deployed in different ways depending on which IPv6 transition technologies are in use. These alternatives are discussed in the body of this paper. For all of these alternatives, there are a variety of technical implications of LSN for end users, ISPs, and application providers to consider. The address sharing enabled by LSN use impacts end users in three primary ways: (1) the number of connections available per user is affected, (2) the ability to uniquely identify an end user device solely via the source IP address is lost, and (3) it becomes much more difficult to reach and maintain connectivity to end user devices.  All of these impacts are present in local/private network implementation of NATs.  Introduction of LSN increases the probability that users will be affected due to sharing of the port number space. The number of users affected by the limitation in port availability may also increase for the same reason.  However, note that a user checking email or performing simple web browsing functions will not be affected by the LSN. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) electing to use LSNs must balance the impacts of new network infrastructure (operational and capital costs) and of engineering this new infrastructure for scalability, resiliency, security, and capacity, as well as meeting mandates to be able to log individual customer IP address assignments, with maintaining an appropriate level of customer service.  In the mobile environment, where every device must be assigned at least one IP address and where simple devices may have limited access to Internet applications, mobile operators have already implemented LSN and faced some of these challenges. However, the continued swift growth in the number of mobile customers and their likely evolution toward expecting wireless Internet service to behave in a manner comparable to wireline service presents new challenges. LSN can have a wide variety of impacts on applications. These may relate to capacity constraints if the LSN is undersized, the handling of multiple connections to the same application server, the loss of IP-based geolocation capability, new logging requirements, and a variety of other factors. Recommendations: BITAG has compiled recommendations regarding steps that can be taken to help ensure optimal user experience, balanced with efficient LSN deployments and operations. Please see the recommendations in the report.","执行摘要：由于IPv4地址格式的限制，其地址空间相对于日益增长的上网设备数量显得相对""狭小""，互联网正面临原始标准化格式IPv4地址枯竭的问题。为此，开发了新一代IPv6地址格式，可为可预见的未来所有可能接入互联网的设备提供支持。尽管全球向IPv6过渡的进程已启动，但升级所有互联网应用服务、消费电子设备和网络以支持IPv6仍需数年时间。考虑到IPv4专用设备仍在生产和销售等因素，过渡期可能相当漫长。在网络运营商将IPv6技术部署到现有IPv4网络的过程中，两种协议必须共存直至IPv4服务需求消退。鉴于从纯IPv4或混合网络环境完全迁移至纯IPv6服务耗时较长，运营商正采用多种技术延长IPv4地址的使用寿命，大规模网络地址转换（LSN）即为其中一种。LSN设备允许多个IPv4终端设备共享单个公共IPv4地址。虽然NAT技术长期存在于局域/私有网络中帮助运营商管理私有地址空间，但已知其会对部分互联网应用产生不利影响，因此LSN中广泛使用NAT需审慎评估。BITAG关注LSN技术，因其作为IPv4向IPv6过渡期间延长地址寿命的关键工具，可能影响互联网生态中的多方主体：包括ISP、终端用户、应用提供商、设备厂商、内容分发网络及执法机构等第三方。全面认识潜在问题具有多重价值：(1) 帮助利益相关方制定预案以最小化对终端用户和应用的影响；(2) 为政策制定者提供技术部署动机与权衡的决策依据；(3) 加速IPv6转型进程；(4) 总体减少因该技术应用引发的利益冲突——有观点认为LSN可能被用于反竞争、歧视等非技术目的。. . LSN部署与影响：根据采用的IPv6过渡技术差异，LSN存在多种部署方案（本报告正文详述）。无论采用何种方案，LSN对终端用户、ISP和应用提供商均会产生多重技术影响。地址共享主要通过三种方式影响终端用户：(1) 限制单用户可用连接数；(2) 无法仅通过源IP唯一识别终端设备；(3) 终端设备可达性与连接稳定性显著降低。这些影响在局域网的NAT实施中同样存在，但LSN因端口号空间共享会提高用户受影响概率，端口可用性限制波及的用户规模也可能扩大。需说明的是，普通网页浏览或邮件收发等基础功能不受LSN影响。采用LSN的ISP需权衡新网络基础设施（运营与资金成本）的投入规模，在确保可扩展性、弹性、安全性和容量的工程化设计，满足客户IP地址分配记录留存要求，与维持适当服务水平之间取得平衡。在移动网络环境中，由于每台设备至少需分配一个IP地址且简易设备对互联网应用的访问能力有限，运营商已先行部署LSN并应对部分挑战。然而移动用户持续激增及其对无线互联网服务体验向有线服务看齐的预期演进，带来了新的挑战。LSN对应用的影响多元：包括设备容量不足导致的性能约束、同一应用服务器的多连接处理、基于IP的地理定位功能失效、新增日志记录要求等诸多因素。. . 建议：BITAG已汇编相关建议以帮助实现最佳用户体验与高效LSN部署运营的平衡。具体建议详见报告内容。","NAT, IPv6, LSN, Network address translation, open internet, net neutrality, BITAG, multistakeholder",2016-01-14

Using disaggregated detailed product data and the gravity model, we estimate the TBT notifications in two separate measures of TBT, namely cumulative TBT, and TBT dummy, evidencing significantly negative effects on machinery imports. This evidence suggests that TBT are trade barriers that restricts the development of machinery production networks. However, this negative effect appears to come from the final product. By contrast, TBT related to parts and components have larger positive effects than those related to final products for imports.",我们评估了技术性贸易壁垒(TBT)对国际生产网络中机械产品进口的影响。通过使用细分的详细产品数据和引力模型，我们采用累计TBT和TBT虚拟变量两种测量方式对TBT通报进行估算，结果均显示其对机械进口具有显著负面影响。这一证据表明TBT是阻碍机械生产网络发展的贸易壁垒。然而，这种负面影响似乎主要来自最终产品。相比之下，与零部件相关的TBT对进口产生的积极效应要大于与最终产品相关的TBT。,"Technical barriers to trade, East Asia, Machinery industry, International production networks, Fragmentation",2022-08-30
technical trade measures,Technology Standards - NewTechnicalBarriers toTrade?,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=960059,Christopher S. Gibson,"At a time when the high-tech industry has increasingly demanded harmonized standards, China has signaled its intention to follow a different direction.  China's recent actions seeking to set its own unique standards instead of adopting international standards shifts focus to the impact on international trade and the corresponding legal framework defining responsibilities for State members of the World Trade Organization.  While trade barriers of the past - high tariffs and quotas imposed on imports - have been greatly reduced, less obvious impediments normally referred to as non-tariff barriers (NTBs) have in many cases replaced them.  One area ripe for the incursion of NTBs concerns technology standards.  The WTO's Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade recognizes the important contribution that international standards can make by improving efficiency of production and facilitating the conduct of international trade, but also cautions that standards should not be used to create NTBs.  China's WAPI standard provides a test-case for ICT standards and their relationship to the international trade regime. It serves to illustrate standards' dual nature as trade facilitators and indispensable elements of the ICT industry, on the one hand, and as potential measures of protectionism when applied inappropriately, on the other hand.  As China's economic power grows and it becomes more adept at playing the standards game, it may find new means for pressing its own concerns in relation to international standards and trade-related issues.",在高科技产业日益要求统一标准之际，中国却表现出要走不同方向的意图。中国近期寻求制定自身独特标准而非采用国际标准的举动，将关注焦点转向了对国际贸易的影响，以及界定世界贸易组织成员国责任的相应法律框架。虽然过去的贸易壁垒——对进口商品征收高额关税和配额——已大幅减少，但在许多情况下，它们已被不太明显的障碍所取代，这些障碍通常被称为非关税壁垒（NTBs）。技术标准领域正是非关税壁垒容易侵入的一个领域。世贸组织的《技术性贸易壁垒协定》承认国际标准通过提高生产效率和促进国际贸易开展所能做出的重要贡献，但也警告不应将标准用于制造非关税壁垒。中国的WAPI标准为信息通信技术标准及其与国际贸易体系的关系提供了一个测试案例。它一方面说明了标准作为贸易促进者和信息通信技术产业不可或缺要素的双重性质，另一方面也说明了标准若应用不当可能成为保护主义手段。随着中国经济实力的增长以及更擅长参与标准制定游戏，它可能会找到新的手段来推动自身在国际标准和贸易相关问题上的诉求。,"standard-setting, non-tariff barriers, NTB, standard-setting organizations, SSO's, USTR, United States Trade Representative, TBT, Technical Barriers to Trade, China, WAPI",2007-01-30
technical trade measures,A Pragmatic Approach to Estimating Nondiscriminatory Non-tariffTradeCosts,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3703002,Peter Herman,"Despite the growing importance of non-tariff measures (NTMs) in trade policy, many common methods for estimating their costs exhibit significant challenges in terms of data requirements or do not isolate the effects of specific NTMs. I propose an extension to existing approaches that mitigates these limitations. Following earlier work by Fontagné et al. (2011), I estimate a measure of the aggregate nondiscriminatory trade costs present in each country. Then, in a second stage, I econometrically decompose the estimated trade costs into individual components such as the costs associated with specific NTMs. Additionally, the second stage allows for the identification and removal of non-cost factors that erroneously contributed to the aggregate cost estimates. The methodology provides a means by which to estimate the effects of specific NTMs using widely available data and standard econometric techniques. I test the methodology using a typical gravity dataset and detailed NTM data. The results provide specific cost estimates for SPS measures and TBTs across many sectors and demonstrate that aggregate measures of non-discriminatory trade costs can significantly reflect non-cost factors.",尽管非关税措施（NTMs）在贸易政策中的重要性日益增长，但许多估算其成本的常用方法在数据需求方面存在显著挑战，或未能分离出特定非关税措施的影响。我提出对现有方法的扩展，以缓解这些局限性。借鉴Fontagné等人（2011年）的早期研究，我首先估算了各国存在的总体非歧视性贸易成本。随后在第二阶段，通过计量经济学方法将估算的贸易成本分解为具体组成部分，例如与特定非关税措施相关的成本。此外，第二阶段还能识别并剔除错误影响总体成本估算的非成本因素。该方法利用广泛可得的数据和标准计量经济学技术，为估算特定非关税措施的影响提供了途径。我使用典型引力模型数据集和详细的非关税措施数据对该方法进行了验证。研究结果给出了多个行业中SPS措施和技术性贸易壁垒（TBTs）的具体成本估算，并表明非歧视性贸易成本的总体衡量可能显著反映非成本因素。,"trade, non-tariff measures, gravity",2020-11-19

I first build a regulatory distance index, which measures the degree of dissimilarity in non-tariff measure structures between two trade partners. By including the regulatory distance index in a structural gravity model, I then find a significant negative effect of regulatory distance on total, backward, and forward global value chain-related trade. The negative impact is even more substantial when I restrict the analysis to manufacturing sectors. On the country dimension, I demonstrate that the effects of regulatory distance are associated with the exporters’ and the importers’ income levels.",本文中，我评估了非关税措施政策异质性对各国全球价值链相关贸易及其后向与前向组成部分的影响。首先构建了一个监管距离指数，用于衡量两个贸易伙伴间非关税措施结构的差异程度。通过将该指数纳入结构引力模型，我发现监管距离对全球价值链相关总贸易、后向贸易和前向贸易均存在显著负面影响。当分析范围限定在制造业部门时，这种负面效应更为显著。在国家维度上，我证明了监管距离的影响与出口国和进口国的收入水平存在关联。,"Gravity equation, gravity model, non-tariff measures, regulatory distance, trade protection, international trade, global value chains, technical regulations",2022-08-08
technical trade measures,The Current State of the KoreanTechnicalTextile Industry and Tasks for Policy,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4190717,Hoon Park,"Technical textiles are rapidly creating new demand by replacing metals, ceramics and plastics with better-performing textiles featuring enhanced strength, heat resistance and elasticity through technological innovation. In particular, advanced technical textiles can augment value-added, not only through the price of the fiber itself but also through significant increases in value-added from the upstream to the downstream in the value chain.Accordingly, advanced countries are promoting technological development and expanding investment in order to take the lead in the advanced technical textile market, where new demand is rapidly expanding. On the other hand, advanced countries have designated high-performance fibers as export-approved items and are controlling the outflow of technology to latecomers.China is also rapidly chasing Korea, expanding its production capacity for advanced technical textiles while actively promoting its own technological development with continuous support from the government.For this reason, if Korea delays the technological development of advanced technical textiles in the future, or fails to establish an advanced technical textile production base, there are concerns not only of technological dependence on advanced countries but also market encroachment both overseas and at home by China.Therefore, in order to develop into a growing industry, overcoming the Chinese pursuit and pioneering the advanced technical textile market currently occupied by advanced countries, it is necessary to industrialize this next-generation growth engine by nurturing advanced technical textiles technologies. In addition, it is necessary to promote the structural advancement of the Korean textile industry by incubating advanced technical textiles that can meet global demand and create high value-added.To these ends, this study identifies crucial tasks for technical textile policies that help create high value-added and increase domestic and foreign demand for the sustainable growth and structural advancement of the Korean textile industry.

In particular, the imposition of new technological standards in destination markets may force exporters to adjust the firm's organization to comply and cope with the additional complexity of the new production process. This paper investigates the effects on firms' organization of shocks induced by the introduction of Technical Barriers to Trade (TBTs) in exporting countries. It relies on the Specific Trade Concern (STC) data released by the WTO to identify trade-restrictive TBT measures, combined with matched employer-employee data for the population of French exporters over the period 1995-2010. It also exploits information on the list of product-destinations served by each French exporter. Controlling for tariffs and for a given state of technology in the sector of the firm, it finds that exporters respond to increased complexity associated with restrictive Technical Barriers to Trade at destination by raising the share of managers at the expense of blue collars, white collars and professionals. This paper is related to the growing literature exploring how firms organize production in hierarchies to economize on their use of knowledge. It is also related to the well beaten literature on the labour market effects of trade, but from the perspective of exports rather than imports.",出口市场的贸易冲击可能会影响出口企业的就业结构和组织架构。特别是目标市场实施的新技术标准可能迫使出口商调整企业组织，以遵守并应对新生产流程带来的额外复杂性。本文研究了出口国引入技术性贸易壁垒（TBTs）所引发的冲击对企业组织的影响。研究采用世贸组织发布的特定贸易关切（STC）数据来识别限制性TBT措施，并结合1995-2010年间法国所有出口企业的雇主-雇员匹配数据。同时利用每家法国出口商所涉及的产品-目的地清单信息。在控制关税和企业所在行业技术水平的条件下，研究发现出口商为应对目标市场限制性技术性贸易壁垒带来的复杂性提升，会通过增加管理人员占比来调整组织结构，同时减少蓝领、白领和专业人员的比例。本文与探讨企业如何通过层级化生产组织来优化知识运用的新兴文献相关，同时也从出口而非进口的视角，呼应了关于贸易对劳动力市场影响的经典研究领域。,"skill composition, labor demand, job polarization, trade barriers",2020-10-27
technical trade measures,"TechnicalMeasurestoTradein Central America: Incidence, Price Effects, and Consumer Welfare",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2433810,Sinead P. Kelleher,"Despite the widespread tariff reductions sparked by the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement, borders in the region remain thick, with many hurdles standing in the way of regional trade. Although anecdotal evidence suggests that nontariff measures raise trade costs and inhibit trade in the region, little is known about the magnitude of these economic effects. This paper uses a newly collected data set to quantify the incidence of sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical barriers to trade in the region and benchmarks it with other parts of the world. The results indicate that the Central American region has the lowest prevalence of technical nontariff measures in the world. However, there is significant heterogeneity of trade-related regulations in Central America; for instance, 48 percent of Salvadoran imports are subject to at least one nontariff measure, compared with just 16 percent of Honduran imports. The paper estimates the impact of these technical measures on border prices and finds that the price impact of sanitary and phytosanitary measures is equivalent to an ad-valorem tariff of 11.6 percent. This price-rising effect is further investigated by looking in detail at the impact of sanitary and phytosanitary measures on the prices of beef, chicken meat, bread, and dairy products in Guatemala. The impact is estimated to be equivalent to an ad-valorem tariff of 68.4 percent, 51.4 percent, 22.0 percent, and 5.0 percent, respectively.

technical trade measures,Implementation of SPS/TBT Agreements - Experiences from Other Countries and Lessons for Vietnam,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2614307,Ngoc Ho,"Although Vietnam has been an official member of WTO since 2007, non-tariff measures such as Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) measures in WTO agreements are not familiar to many corporate or governmental entities. Therefore, TBT and SPS measures are not consistently implemented and the advantages of such agreements are not realized. It was determined that international policy learning, searching international experience for transferable ‘best practice’ and identifying common trends and pressures that affect other systems, would be an avenue toward amending domestic policy to facilitate compliance with TBT and SPS agreements.Given that the plastics and agricultural industries are fast emerging markets of particular importance to Vietnam’s economy, they were chosen as the focus of our study. Two other Southeast Asian countries, Malaysia and Thailand were selected for our policy learning study. Historical to date trade data with country specific policy development trends and strategies were collected and processed. Local experts in Malaysia, Thailand and WTO were consulted. It was discovered that the plastics industry is not an industry with a long history of development in Malaysia but which is one of the most important export products of Malaysia. Thailand is a leading agricultural products exporter even to markets which set up strict TBT and/or SPS measures. Export value, product structure and export market structure were all analyzed. Results suggest that the achievements of Malaysia and Thailand area attributable to well-engineered Government policy, as well as corporate compliance with TBT and SPS measures in both countries. In order to determine how the products of this study might reasonably inform domestic policy and industry practice a better knowledge of the current state of the industries with regard to implementation of TBT and SPS measures was required.

technical trade measures,Port Blocking,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2701485,BITAG Technical Working Group,"Executive Summary: The term “port blocking” refers to the practice of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) identifying Internet traffic by the combination of port number and transport protocol, and blocking it entirely. Port blocking thus affects the traffic associated with a particular combination of port number and transport protocol on that ISP, regardless of source or destination IP address. The practice can potentially prevent the use of particular applications altogether by blocking the ports those applications use. Port blocks can be deployed in a range of network locations, from where the ISP connects with other networks to data centers and customer locations. The Internet was built around the premise of an open and shared environment. Additionally, Internet standards assume all hosts on the global Internet can connect directly to each other, on any specified port number. The practical reality is that blocking of Internet port numbers, either in the short or long term, is a technique that has been used by both wireline and wireless network providers for various reasons for over a decade. One of the original and enduring motivations for blocking ports is to prevent network attacks and abuse associated with particular application protocols.  Some network and security administrators view port blocking as a critical tool for securing systems and information, and see it as part of the ISP’s mission to manage the security risk to its users from theft and destruction of personal information, business records, and other critical electronic forms of information. TCP port 25, used for sending email, is an example of a port that is blocked by some operators to prevent network abuse – such as spam email. Port blocking has also been used to enforce ISPs’ terms of service. Likewise, port blocking was once viewed as a useful tool for managing capacity and bandwidth-intensive applications such as peer-to-peer file-sharing applications on enterprise and university networks. However, increased network capacity and a variety of developments in the application space have caused most residential ISPs to seek other ways of managing capacity. Finally, though rare, port blocking has at times been used to hinder competing applications, such as Voice over IP (VoIP). Port blocking is among a set of tools and tactics (Network Address Translation (NAT) being the other major example) that can compromise the original intent of ports: to provide reliable local addresses so that end systems can manage multiple communications at once. Port blocking can complicate application design and development and create uncertainty about whether applications will function properly when they are deployed. Port blocking can also cause applications to not function properly or “break” by preventing applications from using the ports they were designed to use.  One of the outcomes of port blocking is an increase in the use of “port overloading.”  Port overloading is a tactic whereby application developers will design applications to use a common port, in order to minimize the chance of a port blocking practice impacting the usability of that application. Importantly, it may not be obvious to Internet users why an application affected by port blocking is not working properly, because the application may simply be unable to connect or fail silently. If error messages are provided, they may not contain specific details as to the cause of the problem. Users may seek assistance from the ISP’s customer service, online documentation, or other knowledgeable sources if they cannot diagnose the problem themselves. The fact that the problem could alternatively be caused by home networking equipment or a software-based port block complicates the process of diagnosis. Users’ ability to respond to port blocking depends on their technical sophistication and the extent to which workarounds are available. Overcoming port blocking may require the user to install a software update, change a configuration setting, request an opt-out from the ISP, or to upgrade their level of service (for example from residential to business). If these options are not available, or if users or customers lack the knowledge or willingness to pursue them, users may be prevented from using the blocked application altogether, or they may have to switch to a different application or a different network (from wireless to wireline, for example). Because port blocking can affect how particular Internet applications function, its use has the potential to be anti-competitive, discriminatory, otherwise motivated by non-technical factors, or construed as such. As a result, the Broadband Internet Technical Advisory Group (BITAG) has a number of suggested practices when it comes to port blocking: ISPs should avoid port blocking unless they have no reasonable alternatives available for preventing unwanted traffic and protecting users. Further, if port blocking is deemed necessary, it should only be used for the purposes of protecting the implementing ISP’s network and users. Port blocking should not be used for ongoing capacity management, to enforce non-security terms of service, or to disadvantage competing applications. ISPs that can reasonably provide to their users opt-out provisions or exceptions to their port blocking policies should do so.  Whether opt-out provisions can be supported may depend on the particulars of the access network technology, the location port blocking is implemented in the network, administrative complexity, cost, and other factors. ISPs should publicly disclose their port blocking policies. The information should be readily available to both customers and non-customers alike, and should be as informative and concise as possible. For example, port blocking policies could be provided on the ISP’s public facing website, on a page dedicated to...[see report for remainder of recommendations].",执行摘要：“端口阻断”一词指的是互联网服务提供商（ISP）通过端口号与传输协议的组合来识别互联网流量，并完全阻断该流量的做法。因此，端口阻断会影响该ISP上与特定端口号和传输协议组合相关的所有流量，无论源或目标IP地址如何。这种做法可能通过阻断应用程序使用的端口，彻底阻止特定应用的使用。端口阻断可部署在从ISP与其他网络连接到数据中心和客户位置的各种网络节点中。  . . 互联网的构建前提是一个开放共享的环境。此外，互联网标准假设全球互联网上的所有主机可以在任何指定端口上直接相互连接。但现实情况是，无论是短期还是长期，互联网端口号的阻断技术已被有线和无线网络提供商出于各种原因使用超过十年。端口阻断最初且持久的动机之一是防止与特定应用协议相关的网络攻击和滥用。一些网络和安全管理员将端口阻断视为保护系统和信息安全的关键工具，并将其视为ISP管理用户信息安全风险（如个人信息、业务记录和其他关键电子信息的盗窃或破坏）的职责之一。例如，用于发送电子邮件的TCP端口25被某些运营商阻断，以防止网络滥用（如垃圾邮件）。  . . 端口阻断也被用于强制执行ISP的服务条款。同样，端口阻断曾被视为管理容量和带宽密集型应用（如企业和大学网络中的点对点文件共享应用）的有效工具。然而，网络容量的提升以及应用领域的多种发展使得大多数住宅ISP寻求其他方式管理容量。最后，尽管罕见，端口阻断有时也被用于阻碍竞争性应用（如互联网语音协议（VoIP））。  . . 端口阻断属于一系列可能损害端口原始意图的工具和策略（另一主要例子是网络地址转换（NAT）），即提供可靠的本地地址，使终端系统能够同时管理多个通信。端口阻断可能使应用设计和开发复杂化，并导致应用在部署时是否正常工作的不确定性。它还可能导致应用无法正常运行或“失效”，因为应用无法使用其设计使用的端口。端口阻断的一个结果是“端口复用”使用的增加。端口复用是应用开发者设计应用使用通用端口的策略，以最小化端口阻断对该应用可用性的影响。  . . 重要的是，互联网用户可能无法明确知道受端口阻断影响的应用为何无法正常工作，因为应用可能只是无法连接或静默失败。如果提供错误消息，可能不会包含具体的问题原因。用户若无法自行诊断问题，可能会向ISP的客户服务、在线文档或其他知识来源寻求帮助。由于问题也可能由家庭网络设备或基于软件的端口阻断引起，诊断过程变得更加复杂。  . . 用户应对端口阻断的能力取决于其技术水平和可用的解决方法。克服端口阻断可能需要用户安装软件更新、更改配置设置、向ISP申请退出阻断或升级服务级别（例如从住宅升级到商业）。如果这些选项不可用，或用户缺乏相关知识或意愿，用户可能完全无法使用被阻断的应用，或不得不切换到其他应用或网络（例如从无线切换到有线）。  . . 由于端口阻断可能影响特定互联网应用的功能，其使用可能具有反竞争性、歧视性、受非技术因素驱动或被如此解读。因此，宽带互联网技术咨询组（BITAG）提出了一些建议做法：ISP应避免端口阻断，除非没有其他合理替代方案来阻止不需要的流量和保护用户。此外，如果端口阻断确有必要，应仅用于保护实施阻断的ISP网络和用户。端口阻断不应用于持续的容量管理、强制执行非安全相关的服务条款或损害竞争性应用。ISP应尽可能为用户提供退出端口阻断政策的选项或例外。  . . 是否支持退出选项可能取决于接入网络技术的具体情况、端口阻断在网络中的实施位置、管理复杂性、成本等因素。ISP应公开披露其端口阻断政策。相关信息应易于客户和非客户获取，并尽可能简明扼要。例如，端口阻断政策可在ISP的公开网站上提供，放在专门页面中……[其余建议详见报告]。,"Port, blocking, port blocking, internet, net neutrality, networking, BITAG, multistakeholder, open internet",2016-01-14
technical trade measures,TheTrade-Enhancing Effects of Non-TariffMeasureson Virgin Olive Oil,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3010100,Eyal Ronen,"Over the last 15 years, the global trade of virgin olive oil (VOO) seems to face a stringent regulatory regime, mainly through the imposition of TBT and SPS measures. Such a development should have adversely impacted global levels of VOO trade. However, evidence shows that the world’s imports of VOO have more than quadrupled in value since 2000. Alongside this trend, the share of VOO imports gradually shifts from traditional sources (mainly EU) to New World producing countries, such as Argentina, Australia, the USA, and Chile. By extracting data from hundreds of NTM regulations, as well as all possible registered bilateral trade flows between 2002 to 2014, this paper aims to empirically explore to what extent particular NTMs impact imports of VOO. The results indicate that while tariffs remain a stringent barrier, most NTMs have a positive impact on imports, rather than enhancing restrictiveness. The paper asserts that the majority of NTMs respond to consumers’ demand for higher food safety standards and protection of human health, while increasing available information and transparency. That, in turn, leads to an expansion in the magnitude of imports of VOO products.",过去15年间，全球初榨橄榄油贸易似乎面临着严格的监管制度，主要是通过技术性贸易壁垒（TBT）和卫生与植物检疫（SPS）措施的实施。这种发展本应对初榨橄榄油的全球贸易水平产生负面影响。然而，有证据表明，自2000年以来，全球初榨橄榄油进口额已增长了三倍多。与此同时，初榨橄榄油进口来源逐渐从传统产地（主要是欧盟）转向新兴生产国，如阿根廷、澳大利亚、美国和智利。本文通过提取数百项非关税措施（NTM）法规数据以及2002至2014年间所有可能的双边贸易流量记录，旨在实证研究特定非关税措施对初榨橄榄油进口的影响程度。研究结果表明，尽管关税仍是严格壁垒，但大多数非关税措施对进口产生了积极影响，而非增强限制性。本文认为，多数非关税措施响应了消费者对更高食品安全标准和人类健康保护的需求，同时增加了信息透明度和可获得性，这反过来又促使初榨橄榄油产品的进口规模扩大。,"Non-Tariff Measures, Technical Barriers to Trade, Sanitary and Phytosanitary, Virgin Olive Oil",2017-08-01

Using industry-specific export data and diverse characteristics for 26 countries from 2015 to 2019, we applied a two-way fixed-effects model to the gravity equation. The results indicate that foreign TBT generally had a negative impact on Korean exports. Particularly, this effect was prominently observed at the extensive margin where the number of exporting firms decreased. Additionally, by incorporating various industry-specific characteristic variables such as capital accumulation, value-added, and labor productivity into the analysis, it was generally observed that the export barrier effect of foreign TBT on the extensive margin of exports is less pronounced in industries with high levels of these variables. These findings suggest that, in addressing TBT issues, diplomatic efforts such as trade negotiations should be complemented by government strategies focused on enhancing productivity and market competitiveness of industries and businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).",本研究分析了出口的集约边际与扩展边际以及产业特性如何影响国外技术性贸易壁垒（TBT）措施的出口效应机制。基于2015至2019年韩国对26个出口目的国的分行业出口数据及多种特性指标，通过引力方程的双向固定效应模型分析发现，国外TBT对韩国出口整体产生负面影响。这种效应在出口企业数量减少的扩展边际上表现尤为显著。进一步引入资本积累、增加值、劳动生产率等产业特性变量后，研究普遍观察到这些指标水平较高的产业中，国外TBT对出口扩展边际的贸易壁垒效应有所减弱。研究结果表明，应对TBT问题时，除贸易谈判等外交努力外，政府应通过提升产业及企业（尤其是中小企业）的生产率和市场竞争力来制定根本对策，这也是企业市场进入的核心战略。,"Technical Barriers to Trade, Gravity Equation, Trade Policy",2024-03-13

Indeed, even if tariffs are at a historically low levels, non-tariff measures (NTMs) play an important – and growing – role in global trade policy. In this paper, using a recently released database on NTMs (UNCTAD), and relying on a gravity model, we focus on Chinese exports with two aims in mind: the first is to test for possible heterogeneous effects of different type of NTMs. The second is to verify empirically whether NTMs have larger negative effects for specific set of goods, i.e. final goods. We find that 1) technical NTMs tend to have positive effects on trade flows, whereas non-technical NTMs do not have clear effects at the aggregate level and 2) NTMs have heterogeneous effects at the product level: in the case of final goods, non-technical NTMs have negative and significant effects.",对全球贸易政策议程可能转向的担忧正在加剧。事实上，即便当前关税处于历史低位，非关税措施(NTMs)在全球贸易政策中正发挥着日益重要的作用。本文基于联合国贸发会议最新发布的非关税措施数据库，运用引力模型聚焦中国出口贸易，旨在实现双重目标：首先检验不同类型非关税措施可能存在的异质性影响，其次实证验证非关税措施是否对特定商品类别（如最终产品）产生更显著的负面效应。研究发现：1) 技术性非关税措施往往对贸易流量产生积极影响，而非技术性措施在总量层面未呈现明确效应；2) 非关税措施在产品层面存在异质性影响——针对最终产品时，非技术性措施会产生显著负面效应。,"international trade, trade policy, non-tariff measures, gravity model, China.",2018-09-14

Yet, detailed economic data reveals that in countries with lower tariff rates (developed countries), the use of NTMs is significantly lower compared to developing countries, which implies a possible complementary effect between tariffs and NTMs across nations. Using a dataset of Kee, Nicita and Olarreaga (2009) on ad valorem tariff equivalents of NTMs, at a very disaggregated product level, this paper explores the determinants of NTMs and their substitutability/complementarity relations with tariff barriers. While exploiting the country variation, it demonstrates the decreasing trend of substitutability between the two import policy instruments with the rise in economic development. In particular, a significant complementarity correlation exists between the two trade measures among the wealthiest nations, implying a stronger commitment to freer trade.",在全球关税自由化的同时，越来越多的证据表明非关税措施（NTMs）的使用有所增加，这表明这两种进口政策工具之间存在替代效应。然而，详细的经济数据揭示，在关税税率较低的国家（发达国家），非关税措施的使用明显少于发展中国家，这意味着各国之间关税与非关税措施可能存在互补效应。本文利用Kee、Nicita和Olarreaga（2009）关于非关税措施从价税等值的数据集，在非常细分的产品层面上，探讨了非关税措施的决定因素及其与关税壁垒的替代/互补关系。通过利用国家间的差异，研究表明随着经济发展水平的提高，这两种进口政策工具之间的替代性呈下降趋势。特别是在最富裕的国家中，这两种贸易措施之间存在显著的互补相关性，意味着对更自由贸易的更强承诺。,"Non-Tariff Measures, Technical Barriers to Trade, WTO",2017-08-01

Using SPS measures obtained from the SPS Information Management System of the WTO and controlling for zero trade flows, we find that SPS concerns reduce the probability of trade in agricultural and food products consistently. However, the amount of trade is positively affected by SPS measures conditional on market entry. This suggests that SPS measures constitute an effective market entry barrier. Additionally, we split SPS measures into requirements related to conformity assessment, and product characteristics. Both types of measures are implemented by policy makers to achieve a desired level of health safety, yet, entail diverse trade costs. We find that conformity assessment measures hamper not only the likelihood to trade but also the amount of trade, while measures related to product characteristics do not affect the market entry decision, but have a strong positive impact on the trade volume. This suggests that trade outcomes crucially depend on the measure policy makers decide to implement.",为厘清卫生与植物检疫（SPS）措施对贸易模式的影响，我们在HS4细分贸易层级上构建了赫克曼选择模型。通过采用WTO的SPS信息管理系统中获取的SPS措施数据，并控制零贸易流量后，我们发现SPS关切持续降低农产品和食品贸易的发生概率。然而在进入市场的前提下，SPS措施对贸易量却产生正向影响，这表明SPS措施构成了有效的市场准入壁垒。此外，我们将SPS措施划分为符合性评估要求和产品特性要求两类。虽然政策制定者实施这两类措施均旨在实现特定健康安全标准，但其产生的贸易成本存在差异。研究发现：符合性评估措施不仅抑制贸易发生概率，还会缩减贸易规模；而产品特性措施虽不影响市场准入决策，却对贸易量产生显著正向影响。这表明贸易效果本质上取决于政策制定者选择实施的措施类型。,"international trade, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, conformity assessment, Heckman selection model",2012-02-22

technical trade measures,Interconnection and Traffic Exchange on the Internet,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2701492,BITAG Technical Working Group,"Executive Summary: The term “interconnection” refers to the various means by which network providers attach to and move traffic between one another, and is a collection of business practices and technical mechanisms that allow individually managed networks to connect together for this purpose. There is no central authority that manages Internet interconnection – the overall system arises because of the many bilateral and multilateral decisions that various actors make to interconnect. In contrast to the telephone system, where interconnection is performed in a highly regulated environment, interconnection in the Internet (in most parts of the world) remains a private-sector matter. The topic of Internet interconnection is receiving increased attention as the Internet ecosystem continues to evolve. Networks of all types interconnect among one another, including those of Internet access providers, content providers, academic institutions, and commercial enterprises. Internet connectivity is achieved by passing pieces of data, called packets, from a connected device through networking equipment, known as routers, operated by one or more network providers until those packets are delivered to the desired destination. The mechanisms that implement interconnection thus serve both technical and business purposes, and discussion concerning the technology of interconnection must, of necessity, refer to business issues to some extent – as many of the mechanisms can only be understood in that context. Network interconnection in the United States has evolved significantly since the early days of the Internet, and today is a complex amalgam of models incorporating new connectivity options, delivery options, traffic management requirements and business practices. It is important to note the difference between the two dominant forms of interconnection, which are: (1) transit – where access to every publicly reachable destination on the Internet is provided for a fee; and (2) peering – where customer traffic is exchanged between two networks and the access provided is only to each other’s network and customers. Further, when two networks peer there can also be both “settlement free” (without requiring payment) and paid arrangements. Network operators are motivated to peer for a variety of reasons that may include both business and technical motivations. Each network operator stipulates the technical and operational criteria used to evaluate what networks they will interconnect with, and many of these requirements are made publicly available online. Connecting networks does not come without costs, and a decision to interconnect requires careful consideration of the benefits compared to the costs incurred to connect at each location. The two common options for interconnection are either through a private bilateral arrangement between two networks using a dedicated physical connection (called a “direct interconnection”), or a multilateral arrangement where all networks connect into a public Internet Exchange switch. An Internet Exchange is a service that uses a switch infrastructure (sometimes referred to as a switch fabric or peering exchange) to provide connectivity between multiple networks. Interconnection methods are constantly evolving, and one of the more important developments in interconnection is the use of content delivery networks (CDNs). CDNs provide a more efficient means of distributing content by placing content and applications on servers distributed closer to, and sometimes within, the destination network – essentially bringing data (e.g., popular content) closer to the requestor instead of delivering the data across a potentially significant portion of the Internet. The introduction of CDNs and IXs has contributed to the “flattening” of the historic hierarchical model of Internet interconnection. Internet traffic has grown rapidly since the Internet’s inception, and this has often been driven by the growth of popular applications. Managing the exchange of Internet traffic between networks is accomplished primarily through the use of an inter-network routing protocol called the Boarder Gateway Protocol (BGP). BGP offers network administrators the ability to implement routing policy, or in other words how traffic flows through a network. BGP’s design offers limited support for inbound (traffic destined into one’s network) traffic control. Peering connections are increasingly the primary interconnection paths between networks, supplanting the model of hierarchical interconnection via a small group of long-distance network providers.  In most cases, two parties seeking to interconnect are able to come to terms. In some cases after an agreement is reached, however, traffic volumes or other factors may change, which in rare cases may lead to “de-peering” events if the changes are significant enough. More commonly, such changes lead to a renegotiation of the manner or type of interconnection agreement between the two parties. Although peering disputes over traffic imbalances, and other reasons, are not new, peering disputes in the U.S. have been increasingly publicized in recent years. In some cases traffic can flow contrary to the intentions of network operators, either in error or due to malicious activity. There are a number of important security considerations when connecting two networks. There are numerous types of attacks, as well as various motivations that may drive attackers. There are also a number of potential mitigations, as well as efforts to make routing more secure through new routing protocol extensions, notably RPKI and BGPSec. This report provides a reference on the subject of Internet interconnection, and presents a detailed review on how networks connect, the development and changes in connection models, motivations for connection, how networks manage traffic between each other and some of the challenges that arise as networks evolve.","执行摘要：“互联”一词指的是网络提供商之间相互连接和传输流量的各种方式，是一套允许独立管理的网络为此目的相互连接的业务实践和技术机制。互联网互联不存在中央管理机构——整个系统的形成源于各方参与者作出的众多双边和多边互联决策。与电话系统在高度监管环境下实现互联不同，（全球大多数地区的）互联网互联仍属于私营领域事务。随着互联网生态持续演进，网络互联议题正受到日益广泛的关注。各类网络——包括互联网接入服务商、内容提供商、学术机构和商业企业的网络——都在进行相互连接。互联网连通性是通过将称为数据包的信息片段，从联网设备经由一个或多个网络运营商管理的路由器等网络设备传递，直至送达目标地址来实现的。因此，互联机制兼具技术和商业双重属性，关于互联技术的讨论必然会在某种程度上涉及商业问题——因为许多机制只有在商业语境中才能被充分理解。自互联网早期阶段以来，美国的网络互联已发生显著演变，如今已成为融合新型连接选项、交付方式、流量管理需求和商业实践的复杂混合体。需要特别注意两种主要互联形式的区别：（1）转接——付费获取通往互联网上所有公开可达目的地的接入；（2）对等互联——两个网络相互交换客户流量，且仅提供对方网络及其客户的接入。此外，对等互联既可能存在""无结算""（无需付费）安排，也可能存在付费安排。网络运营商出于业务和技术等多重考量开展对等互联。每家运营商都会制定评估互联对象的技术和运营标准，其中许多要求已在网上公开披露。建立网络连接必然产生成本，决策互联时需审慎权衡各连接点的收益与成本。常见的互联方式有两种：通过专用物理连接建立两个网络间的私有双边安排（称为""直接互联""），或通过公共互联网交换交换机实现多边互联。互联网交换服务利用交换机基础设施（有时称为交换矩阵或对等交换）为多网络间提供连通性。互联方式持续演进，其中内容分发网络（CDN）的应用是重要进展之一。CDN通过将内容和应用程序部署在更靠近（有时直接嵌入）目标网络的服务器上，实现了更高效的内容分发——本质上是将数据（如热门内容）推近请求方，而非跨越互联网长距离传输。CDN和互联网交换中心的出现促进了传统互联网分层互联结构的""扁平化""。自互联网诞生以来，流量增长始终受热门应用驱动呈现迅猛态势。网络间流量交换管理主要通过边界网关协议（BGP）这一互联网络路由协议实现。BGP赋予网络管理员实施路由策略的能力，即控制流量在网络中的传输路径。该协议设计对入站流量（目的地为本网络的流量）的控制支持较为有限。对等连接正逐步取代通过少数长途网络提供商进行分层互联的传统模式，成为网络间主要互联路径。多数情况下，寻求互联的双方能达成协议。但协议达成后，流量规模等因素变化可能引发罕见""断联""事件（当变化足够显著时），更常见的是促使双方重新协商互联方式或协议类型。尽管流量失衡等因素引发的对等争议并非新现象，但近年来美国此类争议的公开化程度明显提升。某些情况下，流量可能因错误配置或恶意活动偏离运营商的预期路径。网络互联需重视多项安全考量，包括各类攻击手段和动机，以及通过RPKI、BGPSec等新路由协议扩展增强路由安全性的防护措施。本报告系统梳理互联网互联主题，详细阐述网络连接方式、连接模式的演变历程、互联动因、网络间流量管理机制，以及网络发展过程中面临的挑战。","Internet, interconnection, network",2015-12-21
technical trade measures,"VoIP Impairment, Failure, and Restrictions",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2701482,BITAG Technical Working Group,"IP networks have supported voice communications for some time. Voice over IP (VoIP) services allow users to make calls between IP-based endpoints and to interconnect with the traditional public switched telephone network. VoIP applications use a variety of methods and protocols to manage connections and exchange media (i.e., the content of voice or video communications) over IP-based networks such as the Internet. In the majority of VoIP applications, connections are managed or controlled using one protocol or set of protocols, and the media is exchanged among the parties involved in the connection using a different transport protocol or set of protocols. The purpose of these separate connection control and signaling protocols is to allow the parties involved in the communication to establish, control, and terminate connections.  Many services that provide VoIP capability also support other forms of real-time media (video or screen sharing, for example). This report uses the term VoIP impairment to refer to anything that prevents a VoIP application from being used in the manner desired by a user. An impairment affecting a VoIP service can occur anywhere along the data path, including in the end devices. For example, impairment may be the result of actions by a network operator, the VoIP provider itself, or the provider of a smartphone’s operating system. Impairment could likewise be the result of a poorly implemented network device or application, or may occur as a result of a configuration or misconfiguration of a home network. VoIP services can be rendered unusable if their quality is sufficiently reduced to prevent meaningful audio exchange between the participants, even if some VoIP traffic is still exchanged. VoIP failure, as defined in this report, encompasses particular kinds of VoIP impairments that arise when VoIP calls cannot be established at all, or when no media is capable of being exchanged between VoIP endpoints. When network operators, VoIP providers, operating system vendors, or application store providers take steps that cause VoIP failures or prevent VoIP from being used, those steps are considered VoIP restrictions for the purposes of this report. The term VoIP impairments (plural) is used as shorthand for VoIP impairment, failure, or restrictions in this report. Issues related to interoperability between different VoIP services are out of scope. This report discusses: (1) how VoIP works; (2) how VoIP may be impaired or restricted;   (3) methods for mitigating VoIP impairments; and (4) recommendations concerning VoIP impairment, failure, and restrictions. The report focuses on VoIP impairments that may occur in residential or mobile networks. This report makes no assumptions concerning the motivations behind actions that result in VoIP impairment, failure, or restrictions, or about the frequency or scale of such occurrences. There are a variety of technical causes of VoIP impairment, failure, and restrictions: Port blocking. In the architecture of the Internet, communication between two systems is identified by five fields: (1) the source IP address, (2) the destination IP address, (3) the transport protocol in use, (4) the source port, and (5) the destination port used by the transport protocol. The pair of IP addresses representing two systems identifies all of the communication sessions between them, whereas the port number pair characterizes an individual communication session between the two systems. If traffic is prevented from flowing to or from the particular ports used by VoIP applications, VoIP failure can occur. This practice is known as port blocking. Application-Level Gateways (ALGs). Many endpoints on the Internet sit behind a Network Address Translation (NAT) device. NAT allows multiple end devices within a local network (the network in a single home, for example) to share a single public IP address. NAT is challenging for applications such as VoIP that require reachability from the Internet. A variety of mechanisms have been developed for overcoming these challenges, including the use of Application-Level Gateways (ALGs), which can automatically detect traffic associated with particular VoIP services and help that traffic pass through NAT devices. However, ALGs may also affect traffic handling in such a manner as to impair the correct operation of other VoIP services. Other network-based causes. The use of some network-based techniques that attempt to identify VoIP requests or VoIP traffic may result in VoIP impairment. These techniques may leverage the Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure, deep packet inspection, or network-based flow policing and filtering that attempt to identify patterns of likely VoIP traffic. Restrictions based on device, application, or application store. Actions taken on a device, in a VoIP application, or in an application store may restrict the use or functionality of VoIP applications. These examples often reflect business arrangements or agreements between application store providers, operating system vendors, device manufacturers, and/or mobile carriers. When VoIP impairments occur, it may be very difficult for a user to solve the problem, even for technically sophisticated users. Whether a mitigation or workaround solution exists, and how difficult it may be to implement, depends on the mechanism that is impairing the VoIP connection. If mitigation options are unavailable, or if users lack the knowledge or willingness to pursue such, those users may be prevented from using VoIP altogether, or may need to switch to a different VoIP application. Mitigations available to application providers for dealing with VoIP impairment also depend on how the impairments are effectuated. VoIP impairment, failure, and restrictions can create difficulties for VoIP users and may deter adoption of over-the-top VoIP services. VoIP impairments can also create difficulties for the operators of VoIP services and providers of VoIP applications, who may need to troubleshoot or work around impairments (where possible) to enable or restore their users’ connectivity. BITAG’s Technical Working Group recommends the following to minimize the occurrences and impact of VoIP impairment, failure, and restrictions:  [see report for recommendations]","IP网络支持语音通信已有一段时间。基于IP的语音(VoIP)服务允许用户在基于IP的终端之间通话，并与传统的公共交换电话网络互联。VoIP应用采用多种方法和协议在基于IP的网络（如互联网）上管理连接并交换媒体（即语音或视频通信内容）。大多数VoIP应用中，连接管理采用一种或一组协议，而媒体传输则使用另一套不同的传输协议。这种分离的连接控制与信令协议旨在让通信各方建立、控制和终止连接。许多提供VoIP功能的业务也支持其他实时媒体形式（如视频或屏幕共享）。本报告将""VoIP损伤""定义为任何阻碍用户按预期方式使用VoIP应用的情况。VoIP服务损伤可能发生在数据路径的任何环节，包括终端设备。损伤可能源自网络运营商、VoIP服务商、智能手机操作系统提供方的操作，也可能是网络设备或应用实现缺陷所致，或是家庭网络配置错误的结果。当语音质量严重下降到无法进行有效交流时（即使仍有部分VoIP流量传输），VoIP服务即被视为不可用。本报告定义的""VoIP故障""特指完全无法建立VoIP呼叫或终端间无法交换媒体的情况。当相关方采取导致VoIP故障或阻碍使用的措施时，这些行为在本报告中称为""VoIP限制""。""VoIP损伤""（复数形式）在本报告中泛指损伤、故障或限制现象。不同VoIP服务间的互操作性问题不在讨论范围内。. . 本报告涵盖：(1)VoIP工作原理；(2)VoIP可能遭受的损伤与限制；(3)缓解损伤的方法；(4)相关建议。重点研究住宅和移动网络中的VoIP损伤现象，不预设立场推测损伤背后的动机，也不评估发生频率或规模。VoIP损伤、故障和限制的技术成因包括：端口封锁（阻止流量通过VoIP应用特定端口）、应用层网关（ALG可能干扰其他VoIP服务正常运行）、其他基于网络的识别技术（如DNS查询、深度包检测、流量整形过滤等）。设备、应用或应用商店层面的限制通常反映应用商店、操作系统商、设备制造商与移动运营商之间的商业协议。. . 对于用户而言，VoIP损伤问题往往难以自行解决——即便技术娴熟的用户也是如此。能否找到缓解方案及实施难度取决于具体损伤机制。若无可行方案或用户缺乏解决能力，可能导致完全无法使用VoIP或被迫更换应用。服务提供商应对损伤的能力同样取决于损伤实施方式。这些障碍不仅阻碍用户使用，抑制OTT VoIP服务普及，也为VoIP运营商和应用提供商带来运维挑战。BITAG技术工作组提出若干建议以最小化VoIP损伤、故障和限制的发生及影响（具体建议参见报告原文）。","Internet, port, blocking, port blocking, networking, BITAG",2016-01-14
technical trade measures,Differentiated Treatment of Internet Traffic,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2701464,BITAG Technical Working Group,"The Internet is composed of interconnected networks, each having its own architecture and technical characteristics. The data transmitted across these networks is formatted as packets containing information payloads encapsulated within one or more headers, which in turn provide the information needed by networks to deliver the packets to their destinations. As these packets travel across networks, they contend with other packets for network resources. Contention can occur at any point where two or more packets can compete for a resource at the same time. The simplest way to handle such requests would be on a first come, first served basis (also known as First In First Out, or FIFO). In practice, however, network operators make many exceptions to FIFO, using the packet header information to classify packets into flows and treating those flows differently, for example rearranging the order or the timing with which packets are sent, or sending them along different network paths. Differentiated treatment of Internet Access Service traffic has been a subject of debate and regulatory scrutiny. In February 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted Open Internet rules that address paid prioritization as well as other topics. This report touches on a broad range of questions associated with differentiation, but is not intended to address or analyze the economic, legal, regulatory, or public policy issues that the differentiated treatment of Internet access service traffic may raise, focusing instead on the technical issues. The ability to treat traffic differentially has been built into Internet protocols from the beginning. The specifications for both IPv4 and IPv6 have included fields to support traffic differentiation since their inception (initially IPv4’s Type of Service or ToS field) to indicate to routers the quality of service desired, in terms of queuing precedence and routing parameters around delay, rate, and reliability. This was changed to more generic service descriptions with the definition of the Differentiated Services Field, and implemented in IPv4 and IPv6. Notably, traffic differentiation in this sense has not been implemented in multi-provider environments, although it is extensively used within specific networks. End to end deployment would require the harmonization and cooperation of a large number, if not all, of the relevant network operators. In its broadest sense, traffic differentiation includes any technique that classifies and applies potentially different treatment to two or more traffic flows contending for resources on a network (a flow being a group of packets that share a common set of properties). Differentiated treatment of network traffic is a two-part process: (1) traffic is classified into traffic streams, and (2) a prescribed set of actions is applied to each stream. This treatment may determine the order in which routers and switches send packets from different flows across the link, the rate of transmission of a given flow, or even whether certain packets are sent at all. While the techniques used for traffic differentiation overlap with those used to manage congestion, differentiation has a broader purpose that includes meeting service level agreement (SLA) guarantees and selecting paths for traffic from different applications, among other things. Differentiated treatment of traffic can also contribute both to the efficiency of a network and to the predictability of the manner in which network resources are shared. Differentiation can be complex, and a common vocabulary is key. This report uses the terms “differentiated treatment” or “differentiation,” as opposed to “prioritization” when referring to the full range of treatments that may be applied to traffic flows. The technical definition of “prioritization” is narrow and generally applies only to certain scheduling, dropping, and marking techniques. This report uses “differentiation” in a much broader sense, including most of the ways in which packets may be treated differently from each other while en route to their respective destinations across one or more networks. The scope of differentiation in this report encompasses the classic techniques of scheduling, shaping and queue management by which packets are processed at a network node, and also includes the techniques by which traffic flows are segregated or forwarded onto different physical or logical network paths where they may encounter greater or lesser propagation delays or contention for resources. This report addresses differentiation applied to traffic on Internet access services, as well as the impacts to Internet access services when differentiation is applied to other traffic carried over the same network. Traffic for mass-market Internet access services is often carried over a common infrastructure with traffic associated with other IP services, as well as the network management traffic used to control devices and report status from them. Since differential treatment of other network traffic has the potential to affect the performance of Internet access services, it is considered here. The subjective experience perceived by the user of a networked application is known as Quality of Experience, or QoE, and the factors that contribute to QoE vary significantly from one application to the next. In contrast, Quality of Service, or QoS, describes the performance of a network service using objective metrics such as throughput, delay, delay variation, and loss. The relationship between QoS and QoE is highly dependent on the type of application, but variations in QoS have been mapped to corresponding variations in QoE for a number of applications. It is possible to use knowledge about the relationships between network performance parameters and their effects on QoE to attempt to optimize the performance of network flows for their intended applications. Differentiation is often also used to address impairments to QoS. Broadband networks use different network architectures and access technologies. Several of these network architectures have developed to take advantage of existing access infrastructure that was originally deployed for other services – for example, telephone service over twisted copper pairs or video over coaxial cable. Other networks were developed to meet specific needs, such as for mobility or for access in remote rural areas. In many cases, differences in network design can be traced to the different characteristics of the access technology used.

technical trade measures,From Insight to Compliance: AppropriateTechnicaland Organisational SecurityMeasuresThrough the Lens of Cybersecurity Maturity Models,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4746006,Christof Koolen,"Cybersecurity is a much-debated topic in both technical and legal scholarship. With contemporary business models hinging on highly performant information systems, there is increased awareness among entrepreneurs that security incidents often have devastating consequences on undertakings’ revenue streams, intellectual property, and brand reputation. As a result, there is an increased focus on the obligation to implement cybersecurity measures. In the context of the GDPR, cybersecurity obligations seem to converge on the requirement to deploy ‘appropriate technical and organisational measures’ in order to ensure a level of security commensurate with the risks posed to an organisation. Yet, given the complex and rapidly evolving nature of the subject matter, the precise meaning and scope of these obligations remain unclear. This contribution offers guidance on how to assess the concept of ‘appropriate technical and organisational measures’ by considering it through the lens of cybersecurity maturity models. Accordingly, this article provides anchorage to scholarly audiences when scrutinizing the extent to which privacy and security measures qualify as ‘appropriate’ in the context of liability claims and actions for damages, thereby creating an opportunity to move from technical insight to legal compliance.","网络安全是技术和法律学术界广泛讨论的话题。随着当代商业模式依赖于高性能信息系统，企业家们日益意识到安全事件往往对企业的收入来源、知识产权和品牌声誉造成毁灭性影响。因此，实施网络安全措施的义务受到更多关注。在《通用数据保护条例》（GDPR）框架下，网络安全义务似乎集中于部署""适当技术和组织措施""的要求，以确保与组织面临风险相匹配的安全水平。然而，鉴于该主题的复杂性和快速演变特性，这些义务的确切含义和范围仍不明确。本文通过网络安全成熟度模型的视角，为如何评估""适当技术和组织措施""概念提供指导。因此，这篇文章为学术界在审查隐私与安全措施是否符合责任索赔和损害赔偿诉讼中""适当""标准时提供了依据，从而创造了从技术认知转向法律合规的契机。","Cybersecurity, Appropriate technical and organisational measures, IT systems, GDPR, Risk assessment, Compliance obligations",2024-04-16

This development, with its considerable economic impact, particularly within the area of global trade, has prompted numerous scholars to explore the direction and magnitude of the trade effects of NTMs. Moreover, increased efforts are being placed on further exploring the determinants behind the use of NTMs, as well as their policy implications. The current paper aims to survey the empirical trade literature, in order to uncover the available responses to major questions regarding the trade effects of NTMs, principally of TBT and SPS measures. Among the questions posed are: (1) How do specific types of NTMs affect imports and exports? (2) Are developing countries more sensitive to NTMs? (3) Are small-medium sized firms more adversely affected by NTMs? (4) How are particular sectors/products affected by NTMs?

The results show that the overall technical efficiency of the manufacturing sector as well as the technical efficiencies of the majority of the individual industries has increased over time. The findings also clearly suggest that trade liberalization, proxied by export orientation and capital deepening, has had significant impact on the reduction of the overall technical inefficiency. Similarly, the scale of operation and the proportion of nonproduction labor in total employment appear as important determinants of technical inefficiency. The evidence also indicates that both export-promoting and import-substituting industries have experienced rises in technical efficiencies over time. Besides, the results are suggestive of neutral technical change, although (at the 5 per cent level of significance) the empirical results indicate that there was no technical change in the manufacturing industries.

The gender theme integrates international trade regulation, being part of UN, OECD, and WTO initiatives, as well as the subject of Preferential Trade Agreements. The research investigates whether, in addition to public elements, there are private instruments of international trade regulation that address gender equality. Can so-called voluntary private sustainability standards be used to promote gender equality through international trade? If so, could such instruments become technical barriers to international trade, impacting competition in Brazil? The research in the International Trade Centre database showed that 70% of the private voluntary sustainability standards mapped contain criteria related to gender equality. The agricultural sector, the flagship of Brazil's export agenda, proved to be the most affected.

technical trade measures,Data Secrets: The Data Act’s NewTradeSecrets Framework,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5054138,Ella De Noyette,"The recently adopted Data Act (DA) creates a complex system of data access, (re-)use and portability rights whose deeper implications are yet to be fully unpacked. Underpinning this sweeping intervention in data transactions is a general desire by the EU legislator to preserve and foster a competitive data market, favour fairness in data contracts, allow users of Internet of Things (IoT) products to have access to their co-generated data, and to empower public sector bodies, in certain special situations, to access privately held datasets. These are ambitious policy objectives that align well with the European Commission’s Data Strategy.Naturally, as in every complex legal intervention aimed at regulating multifaceted dynamics, rules and rights are accompanied by exceptions and carve-outs. Trade secrets (TS), given their ability to cover situations that may escape the scope of (other) intellectual property rights, have attained a very distinctive place in the DA’s architecture. Not only TS feature quite prominently as a tool to mitigate and, one might say, undermine, some of the data access and sharing obligations of the DA. They are also the recipients of a very specific and unique set of regulatory interventions, including a duty to notify a competent authority which will be tasked with what can be arguably viewed as a prima-facie validity assessment of the trade secret claim. Furthermore, specific rules on technical protection measures could arguably equip TS with remedies that go beyond the traditional limits of this category. These two innovations are central to the present analysis and will be assessed in relation to the two specific data sharing regimes within which they are developed: Internet of Things (IoT) and Business-to-Government (B2G) data sharing obligations.This paper, while building on previous scholar analysis, focuses specifically on information that has the simultaneous legal status of data and trade secret. It centres on the potentially conflicting obligations to protect, yet to share, such information as well as on the interfaces developed in the DA to address this conflict. It argues that the EU legislator may have effectively created a new (sub)category of TS, governed by their own subset of rules and procedures found in the DA, for those cases where TS are embedded in IoT or B2G data sharing obligations. The paper refers to this new category as data secrets. The analysis proceeds as follows: Section 2 examines the foundational principles and objectives underpinning the DA and the EU Trade Secrets Directive (TSD), identifying key challenges in uniting these separate approaches. Section 3 examines how the DA addresses TS protection while pursuing greater data access by focusing on the specific regimes for IoT and B2G data sharing. Section 4 highlights two key novel characteristics of data secrets that are relatively foreign to conventional notions of trade secrecy. The first is the decision-making powers of competent authorities as intermediate bodies in confirming trade secrecy. The second is the central role of technical protection measures as technological means for achieving trade secrecy and potentially expanding its effects. Section 5 concludes that data secrets manifestly supplement existing legal structures for trade secret protection in the EU data economy, but in doing so open up a number of theoretical and interpretative questions that seek proper systematization.","新近通过的《数据法案》（DA）构建了一套复杂的数据访问、（再）使用与可携权体系，其深层影响尚待全面解析。欧盟立法者对此番数据交易全面干预的核心诉求在于：维护并培育竞争性数据市场、促进数据合同公平性、确保物联网（IoT）产品用户获取其协同生成的数据，以及在特定特殊情形下授权公共部门获取私有数据集。这些雄心勃勃的政策目标与欧盟委员会《数据战略》高度契合。. . 如同所有旨在规范多维动态的复杂法律干预，该法案的权利规则亦伴随例外与豁免条款。鉴于商业秘密（TS）能够覆盖其他知识产权无法触及的情形，其在《数据法案》架构中获得了独特地位——不仅作为关键工具显著缓解（甚至可理解为削弱）部分数据访问与共享义务，更成为一系列特殊监管措施的适用对象，包括需向主管机构申报的义务（该机构将承担对商业秘密主张的表面有效性评估职责）。此外，关于技术保护措施的专门规则可能突破传统商业秘密救济边界。这两项创新构成本文分析核心，将结合其适用的两大具体数据共享机制——物联网（IoT）与企业对政府（B2G）数据共享义务——进行评估。. . 本文在既有学术研究基础上，聚焦同时具备数据与商业秘密双重法律属性的信息，重点探讨保护与共享此类信息的潜在义务冲突，以及《数据法案》为解决冲突设计的衔接机制。本文主张：当商业秘密嵌入物联网或B2G数据共享义务时，欧盟立法者可能已实质创设了受《数据法案》专门规则程序管辖的新（子）类别商业秘密。本文将之命名为""数据秘密""。. . 具体分析路径如下：第二节考察《数据法案》与《欧盟商业秘密指令》（TSD）的核心理念与目标，揭示二者融合的关键挑战；第三节通过物联网与B2G数据共享的具体制度，剖析《数据法案》在扩大数据访问同时保护商业秘密的路径；第四节指出数据秘密相对传统商业秘密观念的两大新颖特征：一是主管机构作为中间主体确认商业秘密的决策权，二是技术保护措施作为实现并可能扩展商业秘密效力的技术手段之核心作用。第五节得出结论：数据秘密显著补充了欧盟数据经济中现有商业秘密保护框架，但由此引发诸多需系统化解决的理论与解释性问题。","Trade secret, Data Act, Competent authorities, Technical protection measures, Internet of Things, data sharing",2025-02-04

technical trade measures,Real-Time Network Management of Internet Congestion,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2701483,BITAG Technical Working Group,"The Internet, as is the case with many other networks such as highways and electricity grids, operates under the assumption that capacity will be set to a level such that total peak demand will occasionally exceed capacity. Further, the Internet is designed so that multiple users may dynamically share capacity and multiple services may share the same network links and routers, which is more efficient than offering individual users dedicated capacity or different services using separate links and routers. Every link and router in the various networks that make up the Internet has a limit on its capacity to handle data. The capacity of each link and router in individual networks is determined by the equipment installed by the entity that runs each network in an attempt to optimize performance and cost; the lower the capacity relative to expected demand, the greater the probability that demand upon that link or router at times may exceed its capacity. Significantly, a user’s instantaneous demand for broadband Internet is bursty, meaning that it changes rapidly in time – and when aggregate instantaneous demand exceeds capacity on a network it causes congestion, which can degrade performance. Network operators typically estimate demand months to years in advance, and use such demand estimates to plan a schedule for capacity upgrades. Since it may take months to implement a capacity upgrade, the time scale for managing congestion in this manner is months to years. Thus, although capacity planning can greatly affect how much congestion occurs on a network over time, it cannot react to congestion as it occurs. The impact of congestion upon applications depends on the duration of congestion – which can vary from thousandths of a second up to hours or more – and the nature and design of the application. If the duration of congestion is short enough or the application is tolerant enough of congestion, a user will not notice any degradation in performance. Congestion is thus a problem only when its duration is long enough to be disruptive to applications. Congestion in a network can occur for a wide variety of reasons, some of which can be anticipated and some of which cannot. This report describes how network resources are allocated on a short time scale in order to, among other objectives, manage congestion on the network, and how such congestion management impacts applications and users. Congestion management practices are an important subset of network management practices implemented by a variety of parties or organizations, including Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Application Service Providers (ASPs). Policymakers have expressed great interest in learning what congestion management practices are used in the Internet and how these practices impact users and the broader Internet ecosystem. Furthermore, an understanding of congestion management techniques and practices is crucial in discussions about reasonable network management. One of the key design questions about any congestion management practice concerns the subset of network traffic to which the practice is applied, and its impact upon users and applications. Network operators apply some practices to all traffic on their networks, whereas in other cases practices are applied only to the traffic of specific users or to the traffic associated with specific applications. Application- or user- based congestion management practices may achieve better performance for selected applications. They also may enable service providers to offer connectivity products that cater to particular customer’s tastes or needs. However, they add complexity, which may result in added costs that each network operator will evaluate. In some cases application- or user- based congestion management practices may be harmful to applications. Congestion management practices are composed of generic technical building blocks, described in this report as traffic management “techniques”. This report discusses a range of user- and application- based congestion management techniques, including classification of packets, reservation of resources for particular network flows, storage of content in multiple locations, rate control, routing and traffic engineering, packet dropping, and packet scheduling. Congestion management techniques may be combined to offer a collection of capabilities in various network architectures, and can create services with differentiated performance either within an operator’s network or end-to-end. There are also architecture-specific implementations of congestion management techniques for broadband Internet access over cable, telephone, and cellular networks and for Content Delivery Networks. The offerings of a service provider often include multiple services that may utilize the same network links and routers. While there are benefits and efficiencies to sharing capacity between multiple services, such sharing of capacity also requires the use of congestion management practices. Congestion management “practices” are the uses of particular techniques by particular network operators to avoid, limit, or manage congestion.  This report illustrates a range of congestion management practices that show how providers may combine user- or application- based congestion management techniques, including traffic shaping, prioritization, transcoding, resource reservation, and preferential treatment. The report begins in Sections 1 and 2 by giving an overview of congestion and BITAG’s interest in the issue. Section 3 defines congestion and describes instances in which congestion can occur, the locations in the network where congestion can occur, the indicators of congestion, and the impact congestion can have on applications. In Section 4, the report articulates the differences between congestion management techniques and congestion management practices, and describes the different time scales at which congestion can be seen to occur in the network. This section also describes the parties that implement congestion management practices and on what basis. Although all congestion management is important, in order to limit scope and length Sections 5-7 focus on congestion management techniques and practices that: (1) are implemented or potentially implemented in a network that supports consumer broadband Internet access services; (2) act on a time scale of minutes or less; (3) are used for purposes of congestion management; and (4) are based on user or application. In Section 5, the report focuses on specific congestion management techniques. Section 6 gives specific examples of congestion management practices that are based on user or application. Finally, Section 7 gives the Technical Working Group’s recommendations.","互联网与公路网、电网等其他许多网络一样，其运行机制基于一个前提：容量设定在峰值需求偶尔会超出供给的水平。更高效的设计在于允许多用户动态共享带宽，多服务共用相同网络链路与路由器，而非为单个用户分配专属带宽或为不同服务配置独立链路。构成互联网的每段链路与每台路由器都存在数据处理能力上限，各子网中这些设备的容量由运营方根据性能与成本优化原则配置——容量与预期需求的比值越低，链路或路由器出现过载的概率就越高。值得注意的是，用户对宽带网络的瞬时需求具有突发性，当聚合瞬时需求超过网络容量时就会引发拥塞，导致性能下降。运营商通常需提前数月乃至数年预测需求，据此规划容量升级。由于扩容实施周期可能长达数月，这种拥塞管理的时间尺度为月级至年级。虽然容量规划能显著影响长期拥塞程度，但无法实时应对突发拥塞。拥塞对应用的影响取决于其持续时间（从毫秒级到小时级不等）及应用特性。只有当拥塞持续时间足以干扰应用时才会构成问题。网络拥塞成因复杂，部分可预见而部分不可控。本报告阐述网络资源在微观时间尺度上的分配机制（包括拥塞管理方法）及其对应用与用户的影响。拥塞管理实践是网络管理体系的重要组成，由互联网服务提供商（ISP）和应用服务提供商（ASP）等主体实施。政策制定者高度关注互联网拥塞管理实践及其对用户和生态的影响，理解这些技术对讨论合理网络管理至关重要。任何拥塞管理方案的核心设计问题都涉及作用对象（特定流量/用户/应用）及其影响。全域流量管理方案与定向管理方案各有优劣：后者可为特定应用优化性能，或满足个性化服务需求，但会增加复杂度与成本，甚至可能损害其他应用。拥塞管理实践由通用技术模块构成，本报告称之为""流量管理技术""，包括数据包分类、流量资源预留、内容分布式存储、速率控制、路由与流量工程、丢包策略及分组调度等。这些技术可通过不同组合形成差异化服务能力，在有线、电话、蜂窝网络及内容分发网络（CDN）中各有特定实现。服务商常将多业务部署于相同网络设备，共享容量虽提升效率，但也依赖拥塞管理。""拥塞管理实践""特指运营商运用具体技术应对拥塞的操作方法。本报告通过流量整形、优先级划分、转码、资源预留及优待策略等案例，展示用户/应用导向的实践组合。报告结构如下：第1-2章概述拥塞问题及BITAG的关注背景；第3章明确定义，分析拥塞发生场景、位置、表征及对应用的影响；第4章区分技术与实践，阐述不同时间尺度下的拥塞表现及实施主体；为聚焦研究范围，第5-7章重点讨论符合以下特征的案例：(1)应用于消费者宽带接入网络；(2)作用于分钟级以下时间尺度；(3)以拥塞管理为目的；(4)基于用户或应用属性。第5章详解具体技术，第6章提供定向管理实践案例，第7章陈述技术工作组建议。","Congestion, Congestion Management, Networking, Network management, BITAG",2016-01-14

This study reports evidence on the prevalence of NTMs based on an inventory of business complaints. This data source has the advantage of drawing on experiences of economic agents that are directly involved in trading activities, of containing information on ""behind the border measures"", and of covering procedural aspects of NTMs. The results suggest that natural resource based industries, such as agriculture and food, mining, and textiles, are most strongly affected by NTMs relative to their export volumes. Certification procedures, quantity control measures, and technical regulations are the types of NTM most frequently complained about. Complaints about domestic governance practices, such as impediments related to government procurement, investment restrictions, or insufficient intellectual property rights protection account for almost a third of all NTM observations and are in most cases not sector-specific, but of a general nature. These complaints are frequently associated with discriminatory practices or inappropriate regulations, while delays and obstructions are repeatedly mentioned in relation to customs and certification procedures and technical regulations. In any case, the findings in this study should be interpreted with care, as frequency ratios are sometimes poor indicators of the economic and trade effects that result from NTMs.","评估影响进口的非关税措施（NTMs）的重要性仍是一项重大挑战。本研究基于企业投诉清单报告了关于NTMs普遍性的证据。该数据源的优势在于：依托直接参与贸易活动的经济主体经验、涵盖""边境后措施""信息，并包含NTMs的程序性内容。结果表明，相对于出口量而言，农业食品、矿产和纺织品等资源型行业受NTMs影响最为显著。认证程序、数量控制措施和技术法规是最常被投诉的NTM类型。涉及国内治理实践的投诉——如政府采购障碍、投资限制或知识产权保护不足——占所有NTM观测案例的近三分之一，且大多不具行业特异性，而是普遍性问题。这些投诉常与歧视性做法或不合理法规相关，而海关及认证程序、技术法规则频繁出现延误和阻碍的投诉。需注意的是，本研究结果应审慎解读，因为出现频率未必能准确反映NTMs造成的经济与贸易影响。","Trade policy, Non-tariff measures, Country and industry studies of trade",2008-08-17
technical trade measures,Quantifying the Impact of Non-TariffMeasures&TradeFacilitation on Canada-EU MerchandiseTrade,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2139816,Dan Ciuriak,"With tariff barriers to trade having been greatly reduced through successive multilateral and regional/bilateral/unilateral trade liberalization, trade policy has increasingly come to focus on non-tariff measures (NTMs). The term “trade facilitation” is sometimes broadly used to cover policy efforts aimed at addressing product-specific measures such as product standards, and general trade procedures such as the cost of clearing customs, that might go beyond the legitimate regulatory purposes of ensuring health, safety or technical requirements and serve as a non-tariff barrier (NTB). There are both conceptual issues and practical complications in measuring the trade impact of specific regulations, which often specify requirements such as minimum quality, maximum toxicity, technical compatibility, and rules for demonstrating conformity, since these requirements affect the nature as well as the cost of a product and often address externalities such as environmental impacts. Moreover, the total impact of NTMs is also determined by, inter alia, choice of administrative procedures, the efficiency with which inspection and certification is carried out, and level of fees charged, not to mention the response of demand to changes which might be introduced. Reflecting this complexity, even the highly detailed regulatory impact assessments (RIAs) routinely conducted when specific regulations are being considered by legislatures rarely attempt a quantification of trade impacts. In the face of this information gap, quantitative assessments of trade facilitation rely on very crude and indirect methods of inferring these trade impacts. Methods include the construction of tariff-equivalents (derived, for example, from indexes for highly aggregated bundles of goods based on counts of measures without reference to their nature, or backed out of gravity model-based residuals), the intensity of liberalization implied by the “air time” given to facilitation measures in the text of trade agreements, or even  simple assumptions of across-the-board cost reductions. This paper attempts to shed light on the potential impact of a trade agreement on NTBs by drilling down and examining in detail the specific nature of, commercial concerns with, and amenability to treatment through trade agreements of a series of known frictions in Canada-EU trade: namely  eco-labelling (tissue paper), product certification marks (construction-related wood products), registration and documentation (chemical products), recycling and waste management (electronic products), phasing out of specific substances (heavy metals), product certification fees (civil aircraft and parts), safety standards (motor vehicles and parts) and a range of agriculture and food-related regulations (including measures relating to labeling, quarantine, use of hormones and growth additives, animal hygiene, genetic modification, bulk alcoholic beverages, and pharmaceutical approval procedures).  The difficulties identified of quantification of known trade irritants underscore the speculative nature of trade facilitation impacts in the quantitative trade modeling literature.","随着多边及区域/双边/单边贸易自由化的持续推进，关税壁垒已大幅削减，贸易政策日益聚焦于非关税措施（NTMs）。""贸易便利化""这一术语常被宽泛地用于描述旨在解决产品特定措施（如产品标准）和通用贸易程序（如清关成本）的政策努力——这些措施可能超出保障健康、安全或技术要求的合理监管目的，演变为非关税壁垒（NTBs）。无论是概念层面还是实际操作中，评估具体法规对贸易的影响都存在诸多难题。这些法规通常涉及最低质量标准、最高毒性限值、技术兼容性及合格评定规则等要求，因其不仅影响产品性质与成本，还常涉及环境外部性等问题。此外，非关税措施的总影响还取决于行政程序的选择、检测认证的执行效率、收费水平等因素，更遑论需求端对潜在变革的响应。鉴于这种复杂性，即便立法机构审议具体法规时例行开展的高度详尽的监管影响评估（RIAs），也鲜少尝试量化贸易影响。面对这种信息鸿沟，贸易便利化的量化评估只能依赖极其粗略且间接的推断方法，包括：构建关税等值（例如基于措施数量而非性质编制的商品大类指数推算，或通过引力模型残差反推）、依据贸易协定文本中便利化措施所占""篇幅""推断自由化强度，甚至直接假设全行业成本普降。本文试图通过深度剖析加拿大-欧盟贸易中一系列已知摩擦点的具体性质、商业关切及贸易协定处理可行性，揭示贸易协定对非关税壁垒的潜在影响。这些摩擦点涵盖：生态标签（纸巾）、产品认证标志（建筑用木制品）、注册与文件要求（化工产品）、回收与废弃物管理（电子产品）、特定物质淘汰（重金属）、产品认证费用（民用航空器及零部件）、安全标准（机动车辆及零部件），以及农业与食品相关法规（涉及标签、检疫、激素与生长添加剂使用、动物卫生、转基因、散装酒精饮料及药品审批程序等）。量化已知贸易摩擦点所面临的困难，凸显出定量贸易模型文献中贸易便利化影响评估的推测性质。","Trade liberalization, non-tariff barriers, regulatory impact assessments, Canada, EU",2012-09-02
technical trade measures,Anti-Dumping as Insurance Policy: What the 'Grey Area'MeasuresTell Us,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2226026,Dan Ciuriak,"A general argument in support of trade remedies is that they act as an insurance policy that allows countries to take on deeper commitments in trade negotiations than they would otherwise be willing to make.  This paper reviews both the negotiating history of major trade liberalization initiatives and the largely unexploited history of the use of so-called “grey area” measures in the pre-WTO era to manage pressures on domestic economies emanating from international trade to shed light on the extent to which this argument holds true. The negotiating history makes clear that across-the-board liberalization in the absence of perfect knowledge about the possible consequences in terms of trade pressures depends on the availability of contingent protection. Economic theory demonstrates that such an insurance role is welfare enhancing. The history of use of grey area measures in the pre-WTO period as successive waves of trade liberalizing initiatives were being implemented to manage excessive pressures in a context where the trade flows were not characterized as “unfair” but simply disruptive makes clear that that they were clear substitutes for trade remedies. This history provides the linchpin that allows the identification of the on-going use of trade remedies as an implicit continuation of the management of transient trade pressures. While the use of trade remedies may be defended as welfare enhancing on these grounds, with the individual instances of application of measures analogous to claims on a pre-existing insurance policy, the paper concludes that the design of trade defense laws and the emphasis on “unfair” trade in their justification, makes them ill-suited for this role.","支持贸易救济的一个普遍论点是，它们充当了一种保险政策，使各国能够在贸易谈判中作出比原本意愿更深入的承诺。本文通过回顾重大贸易自由化倡议的谈判历史，以及WTO前时代所谓""灰色区域""措施（用于管理国际贸易对国内经济造成压力）鲜少被挖掘的使用历史，来检验这一论点的合理性。谈判历史表明，在缺乏对贸易压力可能后果的完全认知时，全面自由化依赖于临时保护措施的可获得性。经济理论证明这种保险作用能提升福利水平。前WTO时期，在连续几轮贸易自由化倡议实施过程中，针对未被定性为""不公平""但具有破坏性的贸易流，各国使用灰色区域措施来管理过度压力的历史表明，这些措施显然是贸易救济的替代品。这段历史为将现行贸易救济措施视为管理暂时性贸易压力的隐性延续提供了关键依据。尽管基于这些理由，贸易救济的使用可被辩护为具有提升福利的作用——其具体实施类似于对既有保险政策的索赔——但本文得出结论：贸易防御法律的设计及其对""不公平""贸易的强调，使其并不适合承担这一角色。","Trade remedies, anti-dumping, insurance, grey area measures",2013-03-01

Most NTMs generally harm agricultural trade, particularly at both low and high levels of intensity, such as technical barriers and sanitary measures. Other NTMs, however, have a positive impact at low intensity, which becomes negative as intensity increases. The study underscores the importance of accounting for self-selection and non-linearities, as well as considering the heterogeneity and intensity of NTMs to refine estimates of their effects.

Among these, International Trade has acted as the first catalyst of eroding geographical boundaries and traversing continents, itself multiplying in the process. Beginning in the last decades of the century, the WTO, through intense negotiations and agreements, has been successful in lowering tariffs to sustainable levels. But as simple average most-favoured-nation (MFN) tariffs declined, application of alternative protectionist measures such as standards/regulations as trade policy instruments witnessed a surge. These Non-tariff Measures (NTMs) have now become the hot potato of International trade discussions, regularly featuring in WTO’s agenda.Imbalance in market access still prevails in the global arena between developed and developing countries, primarily owing to rising NTMs. This issue is alarming in the case of agricultural trade, wherein the WTO negotiations have led to substantial disciplining of the tariff structure (with 100 percent binding of tariffs) and are expected to further it at the culmination of the Doha Round, while the use of non-tariff measures (NTMs) are on the rise.The working paper is divided into six sections. Section I provides a brief overview of the concept of NTMs and the various ways they are classified. Section II focuses on SPS measures, elaborating on their origin, legal provisions, need and other relevant issues. Further, Section III includes a short review of previously conducted similar studies and their significant findings. Section IV and V form the backbone of the paper, elucidating the empirical results of the study conducted – the Analysis of SPS Notifications on multiple grounds. While Section V highlights significant problem areas, Section VI enlists chief policy recommendations that can be quickly adopted by the stakeholders to simplify international trade.We have established it through finding difference across the three classifications used for this work: the WTO classification; income-based World Bank Classification and the agricultural sector share to GDP or GDP based classification. This work has divided the 164 WTO members into three categories of above 25 percent; less than 25 to 10 percent shares of the agricultural sector; and lastly less than 10 percent shares. It brings to the forefront that the developed countries are the primary cause of this surge in NTMs.",随着世界迅速从多个单一、孤立的地区转变为马歇尔·麦克卢汉笔下的“地球村”，商品、服务、人员、文化等领域的交流呈现显著增长。其中，国际贸易作为消除地理边界、跨越各大洲的首要催化剂，自身也在这一过程中不断扩张。从上世纪最后几十年开始，世贸组织通过密集谈判与协议，成功将关税降至可持续水平。但就在简单平均最惠国关税下降的同时，以标准/法规等替代性保护主义措施作为贸易政策工具的现象却激增。这些非关税措施（NTMs）已成为国际贸易谈判的棘手议题，频繁出现在世贸组织的议程中。. . 由于非关税措施的增多，发达国家与发展中国家之间市场准入的不平衡仍在全球范围内持续存在。这一问题在农产品贸易领域尤为严峻——尽管世贸组织谈判已对关税结构形成实质性约束（实现100%关税约束），且多哈回合结束后预计将进一步强化，但非关税措施的使用却呈上升趋势。. . 本工作论文共分六部分：第一节概述非关税措施的概念及其分类方式；第二节聚焦卫生与植物检疫（SPS）措施，详述其起源、法律条款、必要性及相关议题；第三节简要回顾既往同类研究及其重要发现；第四节与第五节构成论文核心，通过多维度分析SPS通报情况阐明实证研究结果，其中第五节突出关键问题领域，第六节则列出利益相关方可快速采纳的核心政策建议以简化国际贸易。. . 我们通过三种分类体系的对比验证发现：按世贸组织分类、世界银行收入分类及农业占GDP比重分类（将164个成员划分为农业占比超25%、10%-25%及低于10%三组），发达国家是非关税措施激增的主要推手。,"Non Tariff Measures, SPS Measures, WTO Classification, WB income based Classification, GDP Shares of Agricultural sector,",2020-08-04
technical trade measures,Food Safety Standards and Regulations in Malaysia: Implications for the ASEAN Integrated Region,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2735670,Evelyn Shyamala Devadason,"Regulatory heterogeneity continues to be identified as a challenge for food trade in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as the progress of harmonization of food standards among Member states remains slow. One reason is the information shortcomings on the types and forms of standards and regulations imposed by Member economies, as the existing databases lack complete information. Using a new and comprehensive database on non-tariff measures (NTMs), this paper offers updated information on food safety standards and regulations and its implications, from the Malaysian perspective. This paper examines the frequency and diversity of NTMs for the food sector, and then estimates their impact on food imports from ASEAN. The food sector in Malaysia is found to be highly regulated, dominated solely by technical measures, namely labelling for sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) and technical barriers to trade (TBT) reasons, product quality and restricted substances.  The frequency counts and coverage of technical measures are also comparably high in the major sub-product groups of food imports from the region.

technical trade measures,TradeMeasuresto Address Climate Change: Territory and Extraterritoriality,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2878234,Margaret A. Young,"States can reduce global greenhouse gas emissions through trade measures such as energy subsidies, labelling or certification requirements or tax adjustments. These measures modify production or consumption behaviour without regard to territorial borders. Yet territory is a significant concept for international efforts at climate change mitigation: the UNFCCC Paris Agreement, for example, relies on nationally determined contributions in the context of common but differentiated responsibilities. Moreover, public international law doctrine on extraterritorial jurisdiction may be said to require a ‘territorial nexus’ between the object of the trade measure and the state imposing the measure. Should the state concentrate on activities within its borders rather than shifting the burden of climate change mitigation to other countries through trade measures? The issue of historical responsibilities for climate change becomes even more fraught if the adverse effects of trade measures are felt disproportionately by indigenous peoples and other marginalised communities within states. This chapter reviews trade law and other jurisprudence and argues that trade measures addressing climate change are unlikely to enliven —  let alone violate —  public international law rules on extraterritorial jurisdiction. In the alternative, it argues that if a nexus is required, it is relatively easy to satisfy. Neither of these findings, however, dispose of the issue of the lack of parity between and within states with respect to historic contributions to the cause of climate change and vulnerabilities to its impacts. This chapter thus demonstrates the importance of an understanding of how territory — and jurisdiction — operate in the context of trade measures to address climate change, and how this understanding points to a need to be aware of the status and conditions of people within the territory of affected trading partners.","各国可通过能源补贴、标签或认证要求、税收调整等贸易措施减少全球温室气体排放。这些措施旨在改变生产和消费行为，不受地域边界限制。然而领土概念对国际气候减缓行动至关重要——例如《联合国气候变化框架公约巴黎协定》就建立在""共同但有区别的责任""原则下的国家自主贡献机制之上。此外，国际公法中的域外管辖学说通常要求贸易措施对象与实施国之间存在""领土关联""。各国应专注于境内减排行动，还是通过贸易措施将气候减缓责任转嫁他国？当贸易措施的负面影响不成比例地由原住民和边缘化群体承受时，气候变化的历史责任问题就更加棘手。本章通过分析贸易法及相关判例指出，气候相关贸易措施不太可能触发（更遑论违反）域外管辖的国际法规则；即便需要领土关联，该要件也较易满足。但这两点结论均未解决国家间及国家内部在历史排放责任与气候脆弱性方面的不平等问题。本章由此阐明：理解领土与管辖权在气候贸易措施中的运作机制至关重要，这种理解同时揭示必须关注受影响贸易伙伴境内民众的生存状况。","Trade Law, Climate Change, Extraterritoriality, Territorial Nexus, Indigenous Peoples",2016-12-02

One reason is the information shortcomings on the types and forms of standards and regulations imposed by Member economies, as the existing databases lack complete information. Using a new and comprehensive database on non-tariff measures (NTMs), this paper offers updated information on food safety standards and regulations and its implications, from the Malaysian perspective.

The information is compiled through a representative firm-level survey of 143 exporting companies, and interviews with firms of different size and sector in manufacturing. The key findings of the study are that NTMs, specifically technical measures, are perceived to be stringent and pose challenges to small-and medium firms, resource-based firms and firms with less exposure to international markets. The stringency of customs procedures and other formalities, more specifically, is found to be not just a concern when exporting to the advanced markets (US, EU and Japan), but is also singled out to be an issue in exporting to the ASEAN region.

This short note takes up two questions: Why have NTMs proliferated and what are the policy consequences of this proliferation? It identifies three major factors contributing to the proliferation: selective protectionism in the face of mounting import pressures due to tariff liberalization, which creates concerns as it represents the replacement of efficient (tariff) protection with inefficient forms; growing  concerns in areas such as health and the environment which (legitimately) collide with trade interests and thus raise important trade-offs; and large and prolonged exchange rate disequilibria which make the welfare effects of NTMs indeterminate. The paper also explores the implications for adjustment of trade imbalances and domestic competition of NTM proliferation, given their tendency to dampen price elasticities. Given the very different implications of NTMs, depending on the nature of the motivating factor, and their potentially pervasive effects, the paper argues for improved understanding of NTMs.",在贸易自由化浪潮推动下，贸易规模正经历空前增长，与此同时，限制性非关税措施（NTMs）却呈现强劲逆势上扬态势。本简报聚焦两大核心问题：非关税措施为何激增？其扩散将引发何种政策后果？研究揭示三大驱动因素：关税自由化导致进口压力骤增，催生选择性保护主义——这种以低效保护形式替代高效（关税）保护的做法引发忧虑；健康环保等领域诉求（合理）与贸易利益产生冲突，形成重大政策权衡；长期大规模汇率失衡使非关税措施的福利效应难以判定。鉴于非关税措施会抑制价格弹性，本文还探讨了其对贸易失衡调整与国内竞争的影响。由于非关税措施的效应因驱动因素性质差异而迥然，且可能产生深远影响，本文主张深化对非关税措施的认知。,"trade, non-tariff measures",2010-08-18

While Tariffs work as a  pure tax on import, standard-like NTMs potentially affect costs of both domestic firms and foreign exporters. NTMs may  not necessarily work as protectionist measures and even induce pro-competitive effects in  the domestic market in the longer term, especially if we allow for firms mobility. The impact could be different for large and small firms. We extend the model by Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) to include Non-Tariff barriers. We derive some testable implications relating Non-Tariff barriers to the number of firms selling in the domestic market and average efficiency. The link between NTMs and domestic market conditions depends on whether they involve new standards and technical specifications imposed on both domestic and foreign firms or, rather, the extension to foreign firms of standards and technical specifications already adopted by domestic firms. In the first case, there is a decline in the number of firms and in average productivity; in the second case, NTMs induce pro-competitive effects: an increase in the number of firms and of average productivity. We then take the model to the data for a group of European countries and manufacturing industries. We combine Compnet data for 15 EU countries in 2001-2012, providing information on firms performance at the industry level and by size class, with the STC WTO-I-TIP database, with information on Specific Trade Concerns raised at the WTO on NTMs and with the Trains database with information on Tariffs.

Despite this, non-tariff measures have steadily increased in the region. This paper examines the non-tariff measure incidence in ASEAN within the context of the structural changes which occurred in the region during the 1990s. The 1990s was a period of tariff liberalization and outward-oriented policies. These marked the transition of these countries from agricultural to increasingly manufacturing countries. The importance of production network-related trade for ASEAN countries makes the rising incidence of non-tariff measures even more noteworthy. On one hand, non-tariff measures can signal the quality of products of processes, thus stimulating demand. On the other hand, non-tariff measures can act as disguised protectionist measures. Are the ASEAN non-tariff measures motivated by a desire to protect industries which are adversely affected by recent structural changes? Or are these non- tariff measures promoting and enhancing these countries’ participation in production networks? Using a qualitative approach, this paper examines the trends in the imposition of non- tariff measures vis-à-vis the characteristics of the ASEAN Members. The trends in this region provide evidence for both scenarios. That the rising incidence of non-tariff measures coincided with increased participation in production networks supports the argument that these measures promote trade by signaling quality. However, the incidence of non-tariff measures in declining industries suggest that protectionist motives may be at play. These results imply that the idea that non-tariff measures need to be harmonized and even eliminated to promote trade needs to be reexamined.","作为区域一体化措施的一部分，东南亚国家联盟（东盟）成员国承诺在2015年前消除非关税壁垒并协调非关税措施。尽管如此，该地区的非关税措施仍在持续增加。本文结合1990年代该地区发生的结构性变革，研究了东盟非关税措施的实施情况。1990年代是关税自由化和外向型政策盛行的时期，标志着这些国家从农业国向制造业国的转型。对于东盟国家而言，与生产网络相关的贸易重要性使得非关税措施的上升趋势尤为值得关注。. . 一方面，非关税措施可以体现产品或生产流程的质量，从而刺激需求；另一方面，这些措施也可能成为变相的保护主义手段。东盟实施非关税措施究竟是出于保护受结构性变革冲击的产业？还是为了促进和加强这些国家参与生产网络？通过定性研究方法，本文对照东盟成员国特征分析了非关税措施的实施趋势。该地区的趋势为两种假设都提供了证据：非关税措施增加与生产网络参与度提升同步的现象，支持了""这些措施通过质量信号促进贸易""的论点；而在衰退行业中非关税措施的出现，则暗示可能存在保护主义动机。这些结果表明，有必要重新审视""协调甚至取消非关税措施才能促进贸易""的传统观点。","law and economics, non-tariff measures, ASEAN, trade law, structural change",2017-11-12

Despite the prominence of import-related NTMs in this sector, the effects of those measures on welfare remain under-researched in the Malaysian context.  To assess the welfare effects associated with NTMs, the computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is employed with partial removal of NTMs from the baseline scenario with NTMs. The simulation results indicate welfare gains (albeit minimal), both in the short- and long-run, following from a partial reduction in NTMs. The positive welfare effects suggest that some NTMs in the food sector may still be pervasive. Therefore, there is scope for regulatory reform in the area of conformity assessment procedures associated with TBTs and SPS measures.",马来西亚进口密集型食品加工行业受到非关税措施（NTMs）的严格监管，包括技术性贸易壁垒（TBTs）和卫生与植物检疫措施（SPS）等基于质量的措施。尽管该行业与进口相关的非关税措施较为突出，但这些措施对福利的影响在马来西亚背景下仍未得到充分研究。为评估非关税措施带来的福利效应，研究采用可计算一般均衡（CGE）模型，在基准情景中部分取消非关税措施进行模拟。结果表明，短期内和长期内部分减少非关税措施均能带来福利增益（尽管幅度有限）。积极的福利效应表明食品行业某些非关税措施可能仍存在过度使用现象。因此，在与技术性贸易壁垒和卫生与植物检疫措施相关的合格评定程序领域存在监管改革空间。,"non-tariff measures, ad-valorem equivalent, welfare, food, Malaysia",2019-08-26

Among many types of non-tariff measures, the number of TBT and SPS measures implemented increased substantially during the global financial crisis, implying that countries around the world are employing more subtle measures to protect their domestic economy. Harmonizing TBT/SPS related regulations between countries is important in eliminating the unnecessary barriers to trade. In this aspect, this study focuses on the current status of non-tariff measures, especially on TBT and SPS measures, in China, Japan, and Korea and proposes to utilize the existing Pan-Yellow Sea Rim Economy and Technology Exchange Meeting to discuss (a) harmonization of standards, (b) mutual recognition of conformity assessment, and (c) enhancement of transparency issues to lower the regulatory barriers relevant to TBT and SPS measures.",在关贸总协定和世贸组织体制下，关税税率水平逐步下降，而非关税措施在全球范围内日益普遍。在众多非关税措施类型中，技术性贸易壁垒（TBT）与卫生与植物检疫（SPS）措施的数量在全球金融危机期间显著增加，这表明世界各国正采用更隐蔽的手段保护本国经济。协调各国间TBT/SPS相关法规对消除不必要的贸易壁垒至关重要。本研究聚焦中日韩三国非关税措施（尤其是TBT与SPS措施）现状，建议利用现有泛黄海经济技术交流会议平台，围绕（a）标准协调化（b）合格评定互认（c）透明度提升三大议题展开讨论，以降低TBT/SPS相关监管壁垒。,"Cooperation Policy, Non-tariff Barriers",2016-06-24

The assessment within the groups of exporters accounts for products and structural characteristics of the exporting firm, namely size, ownership and age of firm.  The key findings of the study show that most firms choose to comply with the NTMs.  Of concern, is that, irrespective of the response strategy, the general approach taken by these exporters is largely reactive. Further, the most negative approach, which is a combination of ‘exit’ and ‘reactive’, is prevalent among the resource-based, small-sized and young firms that are Malaysian-owned, relative to their counterparts within the different groups of exporters.

First, the theoretical framework provided in the paper shows that the changes of trade patterns with regard to introduction of non-tariff measures by the importing country depend on the relative changes of compliance costs between importing and exporting countries. In particular, it is suggested that the introduction of high standards in developed countries may impose higher compliance costs on producers in developing countries than those in developed countries. In such a case, imports of developed countries from developing countries will decrease. The corresponding empirical analysis investigates the effects of non-tariff measures, primarily SPS and TBT, on imports in eight industries – agriculture/fisheries, mining, textile/garments/other, chemical, metal/non-metallic minerals, transport equipment, electronics and machinery, using the UNCTAD non-tariff measures database. The results are as follows. The effect of SPS measures on imports is significantly restrictive in the agriculture/fisheries and textile/garment/other industries. TBT measures are also trade-restrictive in most industries except for electronics. Further analysis to explain why the electronics industry poses such an exception shows that while TBT measures in electronics play a restrictive role in imports of developed countries from developing countries, they perform a promoting role the other way around. Such results are in line with theoretical predictions and imply with caveat that not all non-tariff measures in certain industries serve as barriers.",中文摘要：本研究从理论与实证角度重新审视并探讨了非关税措施对贸易流量的影响。论文构建的理论框架表明，进口国实施非关税措施引发的贸易格局变化，取决于进口国与出口国之间合规成本的相对变化。特别指出，发达国家实施的高标准可能使发展中国家生产者承担比发达国家更高的合规成本，从而导致发达国家从发展中国家的进口减少。实证分析基于联合国贸发会议非关税措施数据库，重点考察卫生与植物检疫措施（SPS）及技术性贸易壁垒（TBT）对八大行业进口的影响，包括农业/渔业、采矿业、纺织服装/其他、化工、金属/非金属矿物、运输设备、电子及机械行业。研究结果显示：SPS措施对农业/渔业及纺织服装/其他行业的进口具有显著限制作用；除电子行业外，TBT措施在多数行业均呈现贸易限制效应。针对电子行业的例外性进一步分析表明，电子类TBT措施虽对发达国家从发展中国家进口产生抑制作用，却反向促进发展中国家从发达国家的进口。该结果与理论预测相符，并谨慎提示特定行业的非关税措施并非均构成贸易壁垒。,Non-tarrif measures,2018-12-14

From the Malaysian experience in the trade of broad categories of products, NTMs appear to exert a beneficial impact on industrial exports but not on agricultural exports. Similarly, positive effects of NTMs are noted in trade with ASEAN and Japan but not with the EU.

We examine whether these regional tariff commitments have come at the expense of adverse side-effects on the prevalence of non-tariff trade barriers. Comparing the effects of applied tariff overhangs – the difference between MFN bound tariffs and effectively applied tariffs – towards all vis-à-vis African trading partners on SPS and TBT notifications of 35 African WTO members from 2001-2017, we find no general relationship between tariff overhangs and import regulation in our preferred model setting. Larger tariff overhangs specific to intra-African trade relations, however, increase the probability of SPS measures and TBT and thereby contrast with the common assumption of the former functioning as a flexible policy valve. We see the nature of Africa’s formal trade relations as an explanation for these findings. While regional tariff commitments have not only significantly moved African countries away from multilateral commitments, they have also sharply reduced their tariff policy space within Africa, thus seemingly leaving regulatory policy as one of the few legitimate options to level the playing field with the by far closest market competitors.","在非洲多个地区，经济一体化通过冻结对一体化伙伴提高适用关税的机会（使其无法突破承诺水平），成功降低了关税保护。我们研究这些区域性关税承诺是否以非关税贸易壁垒增加为代价。通过比较2001-2017年间35个非洲世贸组织成员对所有贸易伙伴与非洲贸易伙伴适用的""关税悬置""（最惠国约束关税与实际适用关税之差）对SPS和TBT通报的影响，在优选模型设定中未发现关税悬置与进口监管存在普遍关联。但非洲内部贸易特有的较大关税悬置会提高实施SPS措施和TBT的概率，这与""关税悬置作为灵活政策调节阀""的普遍假设形成反差。我们认为非洲正式贸易关系的特性可解释这些发现：区域性关税承诺不仅使非洲国家显著偏离多边承诺，还大幅压缩了其在非洲内部的关税政策空间，这使得监管政策似乎成为平衡与最密切市场竞争环境的少数合法手段之一。","Economic integration, import regulation, non-tariff measures, tariff liberalization, tariff overhang, trade policy substitution",2021-02-25

To mitigate these risks, governments implement standard-like non-tariff measures (NTMs) that align market access requirements with domestic regulations. NTMs may shift consumer demand by improving product safety and quality, they also require compliance from both foreign and domestic producers. However, their impact on domestic producers has received limited attention, raising the need to better understand their role in sustainable aquaculture expansion. We ask whether NTMs hinder domestic producers and how the impacts vary across groups of countries with different archetypes of aquaculture development (i.e., different social, economic, governance, and environmental conditions). We use panel data across 99 countries between 2010-2020 to examine the effect of imposing NTMs on aquaculture production output. We find that implementing NTMs on aquaculture markets, on average, has a small and positive impact on production output. The effects differ by NTMs type: sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS) increase production output, while technical barriers to trade (TBT) exhibit a negative but statistically insignificant impact. NTMs also have heterogenous effects across archetypes: NTMs mainly increase production output of Emerging aquaculture producers, while SPS most negatively affect Developed aquaculture producers, and TBT pose the greatest challenges for Developing aquaculture producers.

What has been missing is the distinction between tariff and non-tariff changes under PTAs. Tariff reduction is a quintessential feature of PTAs. But member countries of a PTA often pursue deeper integration through agreements on nontariff matters as well. Some member countries, however, may want to use non-tariff barriers to compensate for tariff cuts. The current study isolates the effects of tariff and non-tariff changes under PTAs. It involves the construction of a new dataset of bilateral tariff rates for 90 importing and 149 exporting countries over 1996-2010, covering the Harmonized System 2-digit level of product varieties. Given the complexity of non-tariff arrangements, we allow for heterogeneity across three different types of PTAs, namely custom unions (CUs), free trade agreements (FTAs), and partial scope agreements (PSAs). We further consider heterogeneity within each of these three PTAs regarding responding time, partner type, and product type. The key findings are: (i) nontariff changes under PTAs on average increase both the intensive and extensive margins of trade; (ii) PSAs do not have discernible trade impacts unlike FTAs and CUs (iii) CUs have a stronger trade impact than FTAs; (iv) the impact of CUs comes mostly from non-tariff changes, while that of FTAs comes from both tariff and non-tariff changes; (v) non-tariff changes associated with CUs have a stronger trade effect than those associated with FTAs, which in turn are stronger than those associated with PSAs (vi) non-tariff changes take a longer time than tariff changes to impact on the intensive margin; (vii) non-tariff changes under FTAs and CUs between industrial and developing countries increase the exports from the former to the latter more than the other way around; and (viii) there is substantial heterogeneity across sectors in their response to trade liberalization.",近期关于优惠贸易协定（PTAs）的文献着重探讨了集约边际与扩展边际之间的差异，但尚未关注协定下关税与非关税措施变化的区别。关税削减是PTAs的核心特征，然而成员国也常通过非关税领域的协议推动更深层次一体化。部分国家却可能试图以非关税壁垒弥补关税削减的损失。本研究分离了PTAs框架下关税与非关税措施变化的影响，构建了1996-2010年间90个进口国与149个出口国在协调制度2位码产品层面的双边关税新数据集。鉴于非关税安排的复杂性，我们区分了三类PTAs的异质性效应：关税同盟（CUs）、自由贸易协定（FTAs）和局部范围协定（PSAs），并进一步考察这三类协定在响应时间、伙伴国类型及产品类型上的内部差异。主要发现包括：（i）PTAs下的非关税措施变化平均提升贸易的集约与扩展边际；（ii）不同于FTAs与CUs，PSAs未显现显著贸易影响；（iii）CUs的贸易促进效应强于FTAs；（iv）CUs效应主要源于非关税变化，而FTAs效应来自关税与非关税双重变化；（v）CUs相关非关税措施的贸易效应最强，FTAs次之，PSAs最弱；（vi）非关税措施对集约边际的影响存在更长时滞；（vii）工业国与发展中国家间的FTAs与CUs非关税措施更显著促进前者对后者的出口；（viii）不同行业对贸易自由化的响应存在显著异质性。,"Preferential Trade Agreements, Tariff, Non-tariff Measure, Gravity Model",2017-08-10

This paper considers the recent empirical and theoretical literature on non-tariff measures in the world trading system. It provides a set of stylized facts based on available data on non-tariff measures and reviews the key methods used to estimate their trade impact. It considers the theoretical treatment of these measures in the trade literature with a focus on the rules and institutions that govern non-tariff measures in the world trading system. It discusses some of the major issues regarding international cooperation in these policy areas, in particular whether such cooperation should entail deep integration (involving precise legally binding obligations) or shallow integration (which allows countries greater discretion in the setting of non-tariff measures). Finally, this paper reviews some of the specific features the World Trade Organization uses in dealing with non-tariff measures such as national treatment rules and non-violation complaints, and considers policy options beyond the WTO such as harmonization and mutual recognition of standards.",随着世界贸易组织及其前身关税与贸易总协定在削减传统关税壁垒方面取得成功，近期区域和多边贸易协定的焦点已转向非关税措施，包括边境政策和境内政策。本文梳理了全球贸易体系中非关税措施的最新实证与理论研究，基于现有数据总结出一组典型事实，并回顾了评估其贸易影响的关键方法。文章探讨了贸易文献中对这些措施的理论处理，重点关注全球贸易体系中规范非关税措施的规则与制度。同时分析了这些政策领域国际合作的主要议题，特别是合作应选择深度一体化（包含具有法律约束力的精确义务）还是浅度一体化（允许各国在制定非关税措施时保留更大自主权）。最后，本文考察了世贸组织处理非关税措施的具体机制，如国民待遇规则与非违规之诉，并探讨了世贸框架外的政策选择，包括标准协调与相互认可。,International Trade and Trade Rules,2016-05-17

Staiger,"In this paper I sketch out the rough contours of the challenge faced by the WTO in dealing with non-tariff measures (NTMs) as seen from the economic theories of trade agreements.  The key questions for the WTO - the answers to which largely dictate the choice between shallow and deep approaches to integration - appear to be two: Is it the terms-of-trade problem or the commitment problem that WTO member governments seek to solve with their WTO membership?; and Is it market clearing or offshoring/bilateral bargaining that is now the most prominent mechanism for the determination of international prices? I suggest that evidence on the first question points to the terms-of-trade theory and hence toward shallow integration, but that answering the second question may be the key to identifying the best way forward on NTMs for the WTO.",本文从贸易协定的经济理论出发，勾勒出WTO在处理非关税措施（NTMs）时面临挑战的粗略轮廓。WTO面临的核心问题——其答案很大程度上决定了选择浅层或深层一体化路径——似乎有两个：成员国政府加入WTO究竟是为解决贸易条件问题，还是承诺问题？当前决定国际价格的核心机制究竟是市场出清，还是离岸外包/双边议价？我认为第一个问题的证据指向贸易条件理论，因而支持浅层一体化，但第二个问题的解答或许才是WTO确定非关税措施最佳推进路径的关键。,"terms of trade, commitment, border measures, behind-the-border measures, offshoring, bilateral bargaining",2012-02-05

It is based on a poll of 530 Russian, Kazakh and Belarusian exporters. In the research non-tariff barriers are divided into two groups. The first group includes non-tariff barriers such as sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers to trade, quotas, prohibitions, and quantitative controls. The second group comprises price and competition controls (the institute of “special importers,” sale restrictions, restrictions on public procurement, various subsidies). The second group of barriers is often referred to as “sand in the wheels,” because it hinders the movement of goods and in principle can be fully removed. The authors have come to a conclusion that this very group of barriers possesses a more negative influence on trade. Therefore, the main policy efforts should be directed at removing “sand in the wheels” of mutual trade.","该报告首次全面评估了欧亚经济联盟内部非关税壁垒对相互贸易的影响，并提出了消除这些壁垒的建议。报告基于对530家俄罗斯、哈萨克斯坦和白俄罗斯出口商的调查。研究中将非关税壁垒分为两类：第一类包括卫生与植物检疫措施、技术性贸易壁垒、配额、禁令和数量管制；第二类涵盖价格与竞争管控（如""特殊进口商""制度、销售限制、公共采购限制及各类补贴）。第二类壁垒常被称为""车轮中的沙子""，因其阻碍商品流通且原则上可完全消除。研究团队得出结论：此类壁垒对贸易的负面影响更为显著，因此政策重点应着力清除相互贸易中的""车轮沙子""。","Non-Tariff Barriers, Trade, Eurasian Economic Union, Econometrics",2016-03-01

Based on a structural gravity equation and the recently updated Global Trade Alert database, we empirically investigate the effect of NTBs on imports. Our analysis reveals that the implementation of NTBs reduces imports of affected products by up to 12%. Their trade dampening effect is thus comparable to that of trade defence instruments such as anti-dumping duties. It is smaller for exporters that have a free trade agreement with the importing country. Different types of NTBs affect trade to a different extent. Finally, we investigate the effect of behind-the-border measures, showing that they significantly lower the importer’s market access.",现代贸易政策工具中，非关税壁垒(NTBs)所占比重日益增加。基于结构引力方程和最新更新的全球贸易预警数据库，我们实证研究了NTBs对进口的影响。分析表明，实施NTBs会使受影响产品的进口量减少高达12%。这种贸易抑制作用与反倾销税等贸易防御工具相当。对于与进口国签订自由贸易协定的出口商而言，这种影响较小。不同类型的NTBs对贸易的影响程度各异。最后，我们研究了边境后措施的影响，发现它们会显著降低进口国的市场准入水平。,"non-tariff barriers, trade protection, gravity equation",2019-02-21

We then detail how these reductions are estimated in different impact assessment studies of TTIP, we compare and analyse the main differences in these estimations and how they affect the overall economic impact of TTIP.

According to the Tariff Rate Manual (2005), North Korea imposes tariffs at the 8-digit HS code level, and there are a total of 10,529 imported goods with specified tariff rates, mainly import duties, but also export duties on some export-controlled goods. A key feature of North Korea's tariff rates is the low overall level of tariffs. Based on the basic tariff rate in foreign currency, the average nominal tariff rate was 5.5% and the average real tariff rate was only 4.6%. In 2005, the average nominal tariff rate for all countries in the world, including about 150 WTO members, was 8.1%, which is higher than North Korea's nominal tariff rate of 5.5%, so North Korea's tariff rate is low compared to the global average.North Korea's non-tariff barriers were established for the purpose of establishing a centralized governance system for national management of foreign trade, with the goal of building a self-reliant national economy, enhancing the quality of the national defense forces, and strengthening the party-state system. North Korea's foreign trade is subject to state management and control under the principle of state monopoly and is conduct-ed in accordance with state plans, and foreigners are not allowed to trade freely.The direction of North Korea's trade reform is toward “tariffications,” which means re-moving non-tariff barriers and increasing tariff barriers to close the resulting gaps in trade regulations. North Korea should eliminate the non-tariff system and replace it with a tariff system because it is difficult for North Korea to communicate with the inter-national community due to the distinctive characteristics of trade in a socialist country.","本研究旨在分析朝鲜的关税与非关税制度，以揭示其贸易政策导向及法律与制度框架的结构特征，并确定朝鲜在寻求开放和融入国际社会过程中贸易相关法律法规的优先改革方向。根据《关税税率手册》（2005年），朝鲜在HS编码8位税目层面征收关税，共有10,529种进口商品设有明确税率，主要为进口税，同时对部分出口管制商品征收出口税。朝鲜关税体系的核心特征是整体税率水平较低：以外汇基准税率为准，名义平均税率为5.5%，实际平均税率仅为4.6%。2005年全球约150个WTO成员在内的世界各国平均名义关税率为8.1%，高于朝鲜5.5%的名义税率，显示朝鲜关税水平低于全球均值。. . 朝鲜的非关税壁垒是为建立国家对外贸易集中管理体系而设立，其目标在于建设自立民族经济、增强国防力量素质及强化党国体制。朝鲜对外贸易遵循国家垄断原则，接受国家管理与控制，按国家计划执行，禁止外国人自由开展贸易活动。. . 朝鲜贸易改革方向是""关税化""，即取消非关税壁垒并通过提高关税壁垒来填补由此产生的贸易监管空白。朝鲜应废除非关税制度并代之以关税制度，因为社会主义国家特有的贸易体制特征使朝鲜难以与国际社会进行有效沟通。","North Korea's tariff system, North Korea's non-tariff system, trade barrier of North Korea",2024-11-26
non-tariff measures,Non-TariffBarriers in Ukrainian Export to the EU,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1411155,Malgorzata Jakubiak,"The economic relations between the EU and Ukraine have intensified in recent years. Following the 2004 enlargement, Ukraine became the direct neighbour of the EU. At the same time, the country has been developing rapidly and both local production capacities and demand for foreign produce have been increasing. Ukraine also become more open to external partners. All this is reflected in the gradual effective trade integration with the EU; i.e. in growing bilateral trade flows. The overall EU tariffs for Ukrainian products are rather low and other tradition protection measures apply to selective sectors only. Moreover they are expected to disappear gradually within the next few years, following Ukraine WTO entry and expected establishment of the free trade area in manufacturing goods between the EU and Ukraine. However, there exist other so called 'non-tariff’ barriers to trade that protect and will protect the EU market. For a relatively poorer country these barriers may turn to be prohibitive. This is probably the cause that there is general perception about Ukrainian export to the EU still being below its potential. The goal of this report is to explore whether the non-tariff barriers impede Ukrainian export to the EU and to what extent. This report is published about the time when the free trade agreement between the EU and Ukraine is negotiated. The authors hope that the findings will turn useful for designing the extent of this agreement and contribute to the discussion about it by showing the extent of non-tariff barriers faced currently by Ukrainian exporters. The report starts from the overview of Ukraine trade policy (chapter 1), with the special emphasis put on economic relations between the EU and Ukraine. Evolution of bilateral trade flows is discussed next (chapter 2). This is supplemented with the brief discussion of recently conducted surveys on barriers hampering Ukrainian exports (chapter 3). The experience of some current EU members from Central and Eastern Europe, which together with gradual phasing out of tariff and traditional protection measures in the 1990s faced growing non-tariff barriers to trade with the EU, seems to be relevant for Ukraine. Chapter 4 reviews the exposure of CEECs exports to the EU’s non-tariff barriers, and describes how the countries were changing its trade-related legislation towards the EU laws in order to tackle these barriers. Chapter 4 also shows the extent of the EU’s technical barriers to trade in different sectors and how well CEE enterprises were prepared to meet them, once the EU commodity markets opened up completely for the new EU members in 2004. Results of the survey on non-tariff barriers to trade that are faced by Ukrainian exporters to the EU are presented in chapter 5. This is the main empirical contribution and the focus of this paper. The survey covered such areas as certification of origin, customs procedures and technical standards. Finally, chapter 6 concludes with policy recommendations.

Using a dataset that allows us to distinguish between tariffs and different types of non-tariff measures introduced by Latin American countries between 2000 and 2014, we find that large Peruvian exporters benefit rather than lose from the introduction of tariffs and non-tariff measures in their destination markets. Their export value increases and the probability that they exit the export sector decreases as they face new market-access barriers abroad. The reverse is true for small exporters, which are hurt by more stringent market-access barriers.",我们研究了拉丁美洲市场准入壁垒对秘鲁大型和小型出口企业的影响程度。通过采用能区分关税与各类非关税措施的数据集（涵盖2000至2014年间拉美国家实施的贸易政策），本研究发现：当目标市场实施关税和非关税措施时，秘鲁大型出口企业反而从中获益而非受损。这些企业在面临国外新设市场准入壁垒时，其出口值呈现增长，退出出口领域的概率也相应降低。而小型出口企业则遭遇相反境况，更严格的市场准入壁垒对其造成了冲击。,"Firm Heterogeneity, Non-Tariff-Measures, tariffs",2018-04-23

Kox,"International trade in services is hampered by non-tariff barriers that originate from national regulations. Not only the level of regulation in home or export country matters, but also the inter-country differences in regulation for service markets. Regulatory measures tend to affect fixed costs rather than variable costs. The fact that regulations often differ by market, means that the fixed costs of complying with regulations in an export market are in fact sunk market-entry costs. Our theoretical model demonstrates that policy heterogeneity between countries has a negative impact on bilateral service trade. We quantify bilateral policy variety through a new indicator that is applied in a gravity model for explaining service trade among EU countries. The empirical results support our theoretical prediction: the degree of regulatory heterogeneity is inversely related to the level of bilateral service trade. The results are applied to simulate the possible impacts of recent EU proposals for the services market. It shows that making more use of mutual recognition in regulation could increase bilateral trade in commercial services among EU countries by 30% to 60%.",源自各国法规的非关税壁垒阻碍了服务贸易的国际化发展。不仅本国或出口国的监管水平至关重要，服务市场监管的跨国差异同样影响深远。监管措施往往影响固定成本而非可变成本。由于不同市场的法规常存在差异，企业为符合出口市场法规所承担的固定成本实质上构成了沉没性市场进入成本。我们的理论模型表明，国家间政策异质性会对双边服务贸易产生负面影响。我们通过构建新指标量化双边政策差异，并将其应用于解释欧盟国家间服务贸易的引力模型。实证结果验证了理论预测：监管异质性程度与双边服务贸易水平呈负相关。研究结果被用于模拟欧盟最新服务市场改革提案的潜在影响，显示若在监管中更多采用相互认可原则，欧盟国家间的商业服务贸易额可增长30%至60%。,"services trade, policy heterogeneity, non-tariff barriers, EU",2016-11-18

One of them is the difficulty of defining and (NTBs) classifying NTBs. This limits the scope of the regulation of NTBs in the existing WTO covered agreements as well as in the ASEAN Economic Community instruments including the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA). This paper tries to address that issue by resorting to the soft approach. The soft approach tool selected is the ASEAN Trade Repository (ATR). This paper analyses the electronic content of the ATR which like any regional trade portal embodies the non-tariff measures (NTMs) introduced by ASEAN Member States (AMS) and the laws, regulations and orders on which they are based. This paper finds that the success of the ATR in addressing the NTMs depends on the success of AMS’ National Trade Repositories (NTRs). This paper finds that for most AMS, there is connectivity between ATR and NTRs. But there are challenges to the effective implementation of the ATR. This paper concludes by linking the analysis of the ATR to addressing the inadequacies in the regulation of NTBs in ASEAN. The ATR facilitates the identification of NTMs which should be eliminated as NTBs.",东盟框架下非关税壁垒的监管存在诸多复杂性，其中之一便是对非关税壁垒（NTBs）进行定义和分类的困难。这限制了现有世贸组织涵盖协定以及包括《东盟货物贸易协定》（ATIGA）在内的东盟经济共同体文件中对非关税壁垒的监管范围。本文试图通过软性方法解决这一问题，所选工具为东盟贸易信息库（ATR）。文章分析了该信息库的电子内容——与其他区域性贸易门户类似，该平台收录了东盟成员国实施的非关税措施（NTMs）及其依据的法律法规和政令。研究发现，ATR在应对非关税措施方面的成效取决于东盟成员国国家贸易信息库（NTRs）的建设水平。多数东盟成员国的国家信息库已与ATR实现联通，但ATR的有效实施仍面临挑战。本文最终将ATR的分析与弥补东盟非关税壁垒监管不足相衔接：该信息库有助于识别应作为非关税壁垒予以取消的非关税措施。,"Non-Tariff Barriers, Trade Liberalisation, ASEAN Regional Integration, Trade Facilitation",2018-12-06

non-tariff measures,Energy Utility Fuel Allocation Model forNon-Linear Revenue and RegulatoryTariffImplications,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2374251,Balram Avittathur,"The primary motivation for this paper is based on the challenge faced by a utility firm that generates its electricity through multiple coal fired thermal power plants. The utility firm operates in a regulated market and faces severe shortages of low priced coals that are critical to its profitability. The regulatory authority prices the electricity generated on the basis of capacity utilization and energy costs. The capacity component of tariff encourages operation of plants at high utilization levels. Hence, the surplus maximization of the firm turns out to be a non-linear problem. Based on the characteristics of the problem, we suggest a heuristic approach to arrive at the solution. The fallout of the tariff pricing is that it is more profitable to shut-down a power plant rather than operate it at low utilization levels. The secondary motivation for this paper is to address this regulatory tariff issue. An alternate tariff model is proposed that encourages consumption of costlier coals also so that the firm operates at a high utilization level while offering electricity to the grid at a reasonable tariff. Determination of the optimal solution is simple is this model which makes it simple to administer.",本文的主要动机源于一家通过多座燃煤热电厂发电的公用事业公司所面临的挑战。该公司在受监管的市场中运营，面临对其盈利能力至关重要的低价煤炭严重短缺问题。监管机构根据产能利用率和能源成本对发电进行定价，电价中的容量部分鼓励电厂保持高利用率运行。因此，该公司的盈余最大化问题转化为一个非线性问题。针对该问题特性，我们提出了一种启发式求解方法。现行电价政策的衍生效应在于：关停电厂反而比低利用率运行更有利可图。本文的次要动机正是解决这一监管电价问题，我们提出了一种替代性电价模型——该方案既能激励企业使用高价煤炭，又可维持高利用率运行，同时以合理电价向电网供电。新模型的最优解确定过程简便，更易于实施管理。,"Non-linear Programming, Non-smooth Optimization, Utility Tariff, Fuel Allocation",2014-01-04

The scope of NTBs connected to European industrial policy is divided into two spheres: the first are barriers on the level of Member States and the second are barriers on the EU level. On the national level, after the 1992 programme, the EU Member States continued to adopt many technical national regulations. On the EU level measures such as new standards, environment and anti-dumping rules, as well as Community expenditures in the different funds constitute new NTBs. Moreover, external competitors have to face other NTBs, such as VERs (Voluntary export restrictions), biased rules on public procurement, ecolabeling, and limitations on ownership, among other barriers. In this essay I demonstrate that the EU and the European national states run an active, unofficial industrial policy that distort the internal and external competition. The paper concludes that the EU industrial policy is not harmonized with the Single Market.",本文探讨了欧盟与成员国产业政策同消除非关税壁垒（NTBs）的单一市场计划之间的矛盾。与欧洲产业政策相关的非关税壁垒范围分为两个层面：一是成员国层面的壁垒，二是欧盟层面的壁垒。在成员国层面，1992年计划实施后，欧盟成员国仍持续出台大量本国技术法规。在欧盟层面，新标准、环境与反倾销规则等举措，以及共同体各类基金支出均构成了新型非关税壁垒。此外，外部竞争者还需面对自愿出口限制、带有倾向性的公共采购规则、生态标签制度、所有权限制等其他壁垒。本文论证了欧盟及其成员国正在实施一种扭曲内外竞争的非公开产业政策，最终得出结论：欧盟产业政策与单一市场并不协调。,"European integration, industrial policy, non-tariff barriers, Single Market, protectionism, trade policy, economic integration, economics",2003-11-12

In this paper, we analyse the causal impact of this reversal of deep economic integration on consumer prices using novel matched consumer price and trade data for food products. We show that products more reliant on imports from the EU experienced an 12% higher price growth after Brexit. This price growth has exclusively been driven by products that face high NTBs, while products that are not subject to NTBs did not experience any price increases. Based on a standard welfare framework, we show households lost £9.09bn, domestic producers gained £7.34bn, and £1.75bn was lost through deadweight loss in food items alone. Due todifferences in food expenditure shares, households in the lowest decile experience a 52% higher increase in the cost of living than households in the top decile. Our results highlight the costs of un-doing deep international economic integration and the important role of NTBs.",在支持自由贸易和欧洲一体化数十年后，英国于2020年正式退出欧盟，导致非关税贸易壁垒（NTBs）增加。本文通过匹配新颖的消费品价格与食品贸易数据，分析了这种深度经济一体化逆转对消费者价格的因果影响。研究表明，对欧盟进口依赖度较高的产品在英国脱欧后价格涨幅高出12%。这种价格上涨完全由面临高非关税壁垒的产品驱动，而未受非关税壁垒影响的产品价格未出现任何上涨。基于标准福利框架测算，仅食品领域英国家庭就损失了90.9亿英镑，国内生产商获得73.4亿英镑收益，同时产生17.5亿英镑无谓损失。由于食品支出占比差异，最低收入十分位家庭的生活成本增幅比最高收入十分位家庭高出52%。研究结果揭示了逆转深度国际经济一体化的代价，以及非关税壁垒的重要影响。,"Brexit, prices, non-tariff barriers, food products",2025-01-25

The aim of this paper is to bring together the ""state of the art"" in quantifying trade policy measures, so we focus on the extent of the protection granted by policies rather than on the degree of openness of the economy. Given the huge size of literature dealing with these issues, we limit our review as follows. On the one hand, we focus on trade policies implemented at the border: accordingly, we do not consider all the other possible public interventions influencing trade flows. On the other hand, we take into account only indexes explicitly adopting a metric expressed in a ""scalar aggregate"" (tariff- and quota-equivalent measures, or an index in a closed interval). We distinguish between indexes that aggregate across products (same barrier for more products) and indexes that aggregate across instruments (more barriers for the same product). Finally, in order to classify the large number of indexes covered in our review, we propose a typology based on three categories: incidence, outcome and equivalence.","国际贸易文献中似乎对“开放度”与“保护”指标的界定存在混淆。本文旨在整合量化贸易政策指标的前沿方法，因此我们聚焦于政策提供的保护程度，而非经济体的开放水平。鉴于相关文献浩如烟海，我们作出如下限定：一方面，我们仅关注边境实施的贸易政策，不讨论其他可能影响贸易流的公共干预措施；另一方面，我们只纳入明确采用""标量综合""度量标准的指标（如关税等值、配额等值或闭区间指数）。我们区分了跨产品聚合指标（多种产品适用相同壁垒）与跨工具聚合指标（同一产品面临多重壁垒）。最后，为系统归类文献中的大量指标，我们提出基于三类标准的分类体系：影响维度、结果维度和等值维度。","Protection, Tariff and Non-Tariff barriers, Tariff and Non-Tariff measures",2006-05-26

The empirical literature provides contrasting and heterogeneous evidence, with some studies supporting the ‘standards as catalysts’ view, and others favouring the ‘standards as barriers’ explanation. To the extent that NTMs can influence trade, understanding the prevailing effect, and the motivations behind one effect or the other, is a pressing issue. We review a large body of empirical evidence on the effect of NTMs on agri-food trade and conduct a meta-analysis to disentangle potential determinants of heterogeneity in estimates. Our findings show the role played by the publication process and by study-specific assumptions. Some characteristics of the studies are correlated with positive significant estimates, others covary with negative significant estimates. Overall, we found that the effects of NTMs vary across types of NTMs, proxy for NTMs, and levels of details of studies. Not negligible is the influence of methodological issues and publication process.","对非关税措施（NTMs）日益增长的政策关注与活跃的学术争论，催生了大量关于NTMs如何影响农产品贸易的研究文献。实证研究呈现出相互矛盾且多样化的证据——部分研究支持""标准作为催化剂""的观点，另一些则倾向于""标准作为壁垒""的解释。鉴于NTMs确实能影响贸易，厘清主导效应及其背后的作用机制成为紧迫议题。本文系统回顾了关于NTMs对农产品贸易影响的大量实证证据，并通过元分析揭示估计结果异质性的潜在决定因素。研究发现：出版流程和研究特定假设对结果具有显著影响——某些研究特征与显著正向估计值相关，另一些则与显著负向估计值共变。总体而言，NTMs的影响因措施类型、代理变量选择和研究详略程度而异，方法论问题和出版流程的影响亦不容忽视。","non-tariff measures, Trade barriers, Trade standards, Meta-analysis",2018-11-19

The analysis exploits new disaggregated, time-varying data on non-tariff measures (NTMs) faced by Indonesian firms. In response to a depreciation of the Yuan which makes Chinese exports more competitive in third markets, Indonesian firms facing NTMs on their inputs see a much larger drop in their export values compared to firms that do not face any NTM, with the magnitude of this effect varying depending on the type of non-tariff measure. We show that this difference can be explained by the inability of firms facing NTMs to take advantage of cheaper intermediate inputs from China in the face of depreciations of the Yuan, consistent with a model where NTMs impose fixed costs of import. These findings suggest that reforming some types of import non-tariff measures can positively affect exporters’ resilience.",贸易政策如何影响出口商获取中间品投入及应对外部冲击调整出口的能力？本研究利用印尼企业面临的非关税措施（NTM）最新细分时变数据进行实证分析。当人民币贬值使中国出口产品在第三方市场更具竞争力时，与未遭遇非关税措施的企业相比，其投入品面临非关税措施的印尼企业出口额降幅显著更大，且影响程度因非关税措施类型而异。研究表明，这种差异源于面临非关税措施的企业难以在人民币贬值时利用中国更廉价的中间品投入，这与非关税措施产生进口固定成本的理论模型一致。这些发现表明，改革某些类型的进口非关税措施可有效提升出口商的抗风险能力。,"Trade policy, non-tariff measures, exchange rate shocks, global value chains, resilience",2024-04-01

Modern trade agreements go beyond tariff reductions by setting rules, such as market access and regulation of foreign service providers. We examine the contribution of deep non-tariff provisions on international trade in goods and services. Using a gravity model, we find that provisions related to services, investment, and competition make up half of the overall impact of economic integration agreements on trade flows. These deep provisions have larger effects for trade in services  than for trade in goods, and their relative contribution is highest in sectors that facilitate supply chain activity, such as transportation and storage. We apply our sectoral estimates of deep provisions to examine two counterfactuals of the UK signing bilateral deals with the US and with China and India. We find that negotiating services, investment, and competition provisions in these future deals would boost trade relatively more in professional, scientific, and technical activities in the UK.",人们日益认识到，对于英国等发达经济体而言，免关税市场准入只是促进跨境贸易流动的众多措施之一。现代贸易协定不仅降低关税，还通过制定市场准入和外国服务提供商监管等规则来深化合作。我们研究了深度非关税条款对国际货物与服务贸易的贡献。借助引力模型分析发现，与服务、投资和竞争相关的条款占经济一体化协定对贸易流量总体影响的50%。这些深度条款对服务贸易的促进作用大于货物贸易，且在运输仓储等支撑供应链活动的行业中贡献最为显著。我们运用分行业深度条款评估数据，模拟了英国与美国及中印签署双边协议的两种情景。研究表明，在这些未来协定中纳入服务、投资和竞争条款，将相对更大程度促进英国专业、科学与技术活动领域的贸易增长。,"deep provisions, EIAs, integration agreements, non-tariff barriers, Trade agreements, trade policy",2018-03-20

Overall, there is a non-linear relationship between the level of restrictions and the profitability of firms. Banks in countries with low levels of restriction are significantly more profitable than banks in countries with no restrictions, while banks in countries with moderate levels of restriction are less profitable than banks in countries with no restrictions.

The first constraint is related to difficulties regarding the implementation of cost-reflective tariffs. In practice, so-called cost-reflective tariffs are only a proxy for the actual cost driver(s) in distribution grids. The second constraint has to do with fairness. There is a fear that active consumers investing in distributed energy resources (DER) might benefit at the expense of passive consumers. We find that both constraints have a significant impact on the least-cost network tariff design, and the results depend on the state of the grid. If most of the grid investments still have to be made, passive and active consumers can both benefit from cost-reflective tariffs, while this is not the case for passive consumers if the costs are mostly sunk.",本文引入了一个以自利消费者为对象的博弈理论模型，旨在评估监管机构面临双重约束时如何设计最低成本配电电价。第一重约束涉及成本反映电价实施中的困难——实践中所谓的成本反映电价仅是配电网真实成本驱动因素的近似值。第二重约束关乎公平性，存在对投资分布式能源（DER）的主动消费者可能以被动消费者利益为代价获益的担忧。研究发现这两重约束对最低成本网络电价设计具有显著影响，其结果取决于电网状态：若电网大部分投资尚未完成，被动与主动消费者均可从成本反映电价中获益；而当成本主要为沉没成本时，被动消费者则无法获得同等收益。,"Batteries, distributed energy adoption, distribution network tariff design, gametheory, non-cooperative behaviour",2021-03-16

It is well-known that tackling NTBs poses many challenges for the analyst because of their diverse and complex nature, and the lack of available evidence. NTBs pose also particular difficulties to computable/applied general equilibrium (CGE) modelling, traditionally more comfortable with policies whose impact can be interpreted into direct effects on prices. This research provides a quantification of the impact of NTBs at the global level. The model we use is significantly larger than in previous studies, and to our knowledge, the first truly global one. The main focus of this research, however, is to discuss and question the various treatments of NTBs in CGE models with a specific application of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) standard model, the workhorse of trade policy CGE analysis. We find that serious estimation and modelling efforts remain to be undertaken in order to make CGE modelling a useful policy tool to analyze NTBs.

non-tariff measures,Cooperation in WTO'sTariffWaters,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2288494,Alessandro Nicita,"A rationale for cooperation in trade negotiations is the internalization of terms-of-trade externalities. With the help of a simple theoretical framework we show that the textbook prediction that non-cooperative tariffs are positively correlated to the importer's market power is reversed when tariffs are set cooperatively. We use this prediction to identify the extent of cooperation reflected in WTO members' tariffs. Because many members of the WTO apply tariffs well below the negotiated tariff bounds, creating what is known as tariff water, there is also room for WTO members to set non-cooperative tariffs. As expected, we found that in the absence of tariff water, WTO tariffs are set cooperatively. Interestingly, non-cooperative tariff setting is only observed in the presence of sufficiently large amounts of tariff water, suggesting that cooperation in the WTO goes well beyond negotiated tariff bounds. We also found evidence that cooperation within WTO tariff waters can be explained by the fear of retaliation from trading partners with market power and tariff water in their schedules.","贸易合作谈判的一个理论基础在于内化贸易条件的外部性。通过一个简单的理论框架，我们证明当关税以合作方式设定时，教科书关于非合作关税与进口国市场势力呈正相关的预测会发生逆转。我们利用这一预测来识别WTO成员关税中体现的合作程度。由于许多WTO成员实施的实际关税远低于谈判达成的约束税率，形成所谓的""关税水分""，这也为成员设定非合作关税提供了空间。如预期所示，我们发现当不存在关税水分时，WTO成员的关税设定呈现合作性。有趣的是，非合作关税设定仅出现在存在足够大量关税水分的情况下，这表明WTO内的合作范围远超谈判达成的约束税率。我们还发现证据表明，WTO约束税率范围内的合作行为，可以用成员对具有市场势力且自身关税表中存在关税水分的贸易伙伴可能实施报复的担忧来解释。","Export supply elasticities, Tariff water, WTO cooperation",2013-07-02
non-tariff measures,New Concerns in International Business: The Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Policies,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3434082,Maria Esther Kim,"In recent years, the debate over the application of non-tariff measures for environmental protection as a new form of disguised restriction on international trade by developed countries has become increasingly important. While tariffs have decreased over the decades, the increasing application of environmental-related requirements are a new factor that affects international business. These new requirements not only modify companies’ decision-making processes at national and international levels, but also within the firm. Hence, this paper proposes to examine the application of such measures by the European Union in the tea, coffee and yerba mate market, and their impact on exporting Latin-American firms for the 1995-2015 period and analyze whether there has been an improvement in their productive quality. For this aim, through a qualitative methodology, we carried out interviews with specialists of the field and surveys to Latin-American exporting companies. In this way, this analysis discusses with theorists if the application of measures related to environmental sustainability leads to ameliorate firms’ productive quality. Among the results, it is highlighted the fact that non-tariff measures — in particular sanitary and phytosanitary ones — have been used as trade barriers. However, complying with them allows exporting companies to develop environmental performance strategies and ultimately, it leads to a positive growth in their productive quality in the medium-long term.",近年来，发达国家以环境保护为名实施非关税措施作为国际贸易新型隐性限制手段的争议日益突出。尽管过去几十年间关税水平持续下降，但日益增多的环保相关要求正成为影响国际商业的新因素。这些新要求不仅改变了企业在国内和国际层面的决策流程，也深刻影响了企业内部运作。本文以1995-2015年间欧盟在茶叶、咖啡和马黛茶市场实施的非关税措施为例，研究其对拉美出口企业的影响，并分析其生产质量是否得到提升。通过定性研究方法，我们对领域专家进行访谈并对拉美出口企业开展问卷调查，据此与理论界探讨环境可持续性措施的应用是否促进了企业生产质量的改善。研究发现，非关税措施——尤其是卫生与植物检疫措施——确实被用作贸易壁垒，但达标过程促使出口企业制定环境绩效战略，最终在中长期实现生产质量的积极提升。,"non-tariff measures, trade barriers, sanitary and phytosanitary policies, productive quality",2019-08-08

non-tariff measures,Heterogeneous Effects ofTariffandNon-TariffTrade-Policy Barriers in Quantitative General Equilibrium,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3360069,Peter H. Egger,"Structural quantitative work in international economics typically treats trade policy as log-linearly related to trade costs and as exogenous. This paper proposes a structural approach that allows for a non-parametric relationship and treats tariff and non-tariff trade-policy variables as potentially endogenous in log-linear estimation. We document that the data reject the assumption of log-linearity of trade costs in both the tariff- and the non-tariff-policy domains. Specifically, the partial impact of a change in tariffs is strongest for low policy barriers and medium levels of tariffs but generally decreases in the level of both non-tariff barriers and tariff barriers. To give a relevant illustration, we assess the effects of a unilateral increase of US tariffs on Chinese imports by 10 percentage points and document that the estimated effects on real bilateral trade-flow changes would be largely underestimated by standard approaches.",国际经济学中的结构性定量研究通常将贸易政策视为与贸易成本呈对数线性关系且外生。本文提出一种结构性方法，允许非参数关系，并在对数线性估计中将关税和非关税贸易政策变量视为潜在内生。我们记录的数据显示，在关税和非关税政策领域，贸易成本的对数线性假设均被拒绝。具体而言，关税变动的边际影响在低政策壁垒和中等关税水平时最强，但通常随非关税壁垒和关税壁垒水平的上升而减弱。为提供相关例证，我们评估了美国对中国进口商品单边加征10个百分点关税的影响，并证明标准方法对实际双边贸易流量变化的估计效果会出现显著低估。,"Generalized propensity scores, Gravity models, Non-parametric methods, Semi-parametric methods, trade policy",2019-03-27
non-tariff measures,Non-TariffBarriers and Bargaining in Generic and Off-Patent Pharmaceuticals,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3313630,Sharat Ganapati,"Pharmaceutical prices are widely dispersed across countries with comparable quality standards. We study two elements of this dispersion; non-tariff barriers and buyer bargaining power. Under monopoly, generic drug prices are 3-4 times higher in the United States. With 6 or more competitors, generic drug prices are similar across countries. Motivated by this, we use a bargaining model to examine two policy solutions to reduce drug prices. First, we remove non-tariff barriers to increase the number of competitors through a reciprocal approval arrangement and market entry. Second, we explore the US government's unexploited purchasing power to negotiate drug prices. Regarding Medicaid, the first measure can reduce total expenditures by 8% and the second by 18%. There are very little additional savings from doing both procedures in tandem.",药品价格在质量标准相近的国家之间存在广泛差异。我们研究了导致这种差异的两大因素：非关税壁垒和买方议价能力。在垄断情况下，美国仿制药价格高出3-4倍；但当竞争者达到6家或以上时，各国仿制药价格趋于一致。基于此发现，我们运用议价模型检验两种降低药价的政策方案：首先通过互认审批和市场准入消除非关税壁垒以增加竞争者数量；其次挖掘美国政府未充分利用的采购权来协商药价。针对医疗补助计划，第一项措施可减少8%总支出，第二项可减少18%。两项措施同时实施带来的额外节省微乎其微。,"Law of One Price, Competition, Bargaining, Pharmaceuticals, Non-Tariff Barriers, Healthcare Economics, International Trade",2019-01-20

However, in changing economic circumstances, these beneficial effects may only endure for a while and often gradually fade, affecting industries unevenly. This study delves into this overlooked phenomenon by exploring Poland‘s export performance in the Western Balkan (WB) region, where the implementation of Stabilization and Association Agreements (SAAs) has evidently generated export growth, primarily driven by tariff reductions, though these gains were manifested disproportionally across sectors. Employing survival analysis, the study validates the positive influence of SAAs on Polish export competitiveness within the WBs while uncovering its temporal erosion and sectoral discrepancies. On average, a 51% and 84% decline in Polish export competitiveness to WBs is observed after 5 and 10 years, respectively. Moreover, a unique dataset on non-tariff measures (NTMs) is employed to identify specific sectors encountering significant NTMs contributing to the reported diverse export patterns. These insights highlight the need for policies that acknowledge the diminishing benefits of trade agreements and mitigate the trade imbalances caused by NTMs.",优惠贸易协定（PTAs）因其具有缓解市场缺陷和扩大出口机会的潜力而广受赞誉。然而，在不断变化的经济环境下，这些积极效应可能仅能维持一段时间，并往往逐渐减弱，对各行业的影响并不均衡。本研究通过探讨波兰在西巴尔干（WB）地区的出口表现，深入剖析了这一被忽视的现象。在该地区，《稳定与联系协定》（SAAs）的实施明显推动了出口增长（主要得益于关税削减），但不同行业获得的收益存在显著差异。通过生存分析，研究验证了SAAs对波兰在西巴尔干地区出口竞争力的积极影响，同时也揭示了这种影响会随时间减弱且存在行业差异。平均而言，波兰对西巴尔干地区的出口竞争力在5年和10年后分别下降51%和84%。此外，研究采用独特的非关税措施（NTMs）数据集，识别出遭遇重大非关税壁垒的特定行业，这些壁垒正是造成出口模式差异的关键因素。这些发现强调，政策制定需认识到贸易协定效益的递减性，并采取措施缓解非关税措施造成的贸易失衡。,"Export competitiveness, Non-Tariff Measures, Survival analysis, Trade agreements",2024-05-07

This study uses data on infringements to Single Market law on the free movement of goods. After controlling for country and industry-specific factors, we show that domestic institutional characteristics are relevant to explain non- compliance ensuing from trade protection measures implemented by EU countries. While government independence from political pressures and higher levels of representativeness and accountability reduce the propensity of member states to infringe upon Single Market laws on the free movement of goods, better regulatory quality increases the probability of non-compliance at industry level, suggesting that increases in competition generate protectionist measures that violate Single Market law.",本文探讨了欧盟成员国国家制度环境在解释单一市场内部贸易中非关税壁垒违规行为中的作用。本研究采用关于商品自由流动领域违反单一市场法规的数据进行分析。在控制国家和行业特定因素后，我们发现国内制度特征对解释欧盟国家实施贸易保护措施导致的违规行为具有解释力。研究显示：政府免受政治干预的独立性以及更高水平的代表性与问责制会降低成员国违反商品自由流动法规的倾向；而更优质的监管质量反而会提高行业层面的违规概率，这表明竞争加剧会引发违反单一市场法规的保护主义措施。,"Single Market, institutional setting, non-compliance, trade protection, non-tariff barriers, count data models",2014-03-10

The NTBs were identified through interviews with selected Brazilian companies from three sectors - Footwear, Frozen Chicken and Steel Products - and through 412 questionaries answered by Brazilian exporting firms. During the interviews, the main NTBs identified for each sector were: a) Footwear: labeling regulations, industrial standards and regulations, licensing and customs clearance procedures; b) Frozen Chicken: sanitary regulations, antidumping files and customs clearance procedures; c) Steel Products: safety and industrial standards and regulations, antidumping duties, discriminatory bilateral agreements and customs clearance procedures. Concerning the questionaries, a list with 16 non tariff barriers to trade divided into visible and non visible barriers were presented to the exporting firms. They were asked to identify which NTBs they faced by them when trading with the other Mercosur's member countries and what was their importance. The level of importance ranged from one (little important) to six (very important). According to the companies the NTBs that affect them most in their intra Mercosur trade are: a) Visible barriers: freight and insurance costs and expenses due to customs procedures; b) Non visible barriers: labeling regulations, customs procedures, previous inspection of products and safety and industrial standards and regulations. Once identified the main NTBs that affect Brazilian companies sales to the other three Mercosur's member countries, one can propose actions to eliminate them and increase trade among the countries. Such actions are: a) harmonization of health and sanitary regulations and quality standards and acceptance of certificates issued by government agencies or previously selected certifying companies of any member country; b) prohibition of antidumping duties in intra Mercosur trade. The dumping cases should be investigated and judged by domestic agencies dealing with antitrust and competition policies; c) adoption of uniform customs procedures for intra Mercosur trade by the four member countries.",本文的主要目的是识别并分析南方共同市场其他三个成员国对巴西出口设置的非关税壁垒（NTBs）。通过采访三个行业（鞋类、冷冻鸡肉和钢铁产品）的精选巴西企业，以及412家巴西出口企业填写的问卷，我们识别出了这些非关税壁垒。在访谈中，各行业面临的主要非关税壁垒包括：a) 鞋类：标签规定、工业标准与法规、许可及清关程序；b) 冷冻鸡肉：卫生法规、反倾销案件和清关程序；c) 钢铁产品：安全与工业标准及法规、反倾销税、歧视性双边协议和清关程序。在问卷调查中，出口企业需从一份包含16项非关税壁垒的清单（分为显性与隐性壁垒）中标注其在与南方共同市场其他成员国贸易时遭遇的壁垒及其重要性，重要性等级从1（不重要）到6（非常重要）。企业反馈显示，对其区域内贸易影响最大的非关税壁垒为：a) 显性壁垒：因海关程序产生的运费与保险费用；b) 隐性壁垒：标签规定、海关程序、产品预检以及安全与工业标准及法规。基于这些发现，可提出以下消除壁垒、促进成员国间贸易的行动建议：a) 统一卫生法规与质量标准，承认成员国政府机构或指定认证公司颁发的证书；b) 禁止南方共同市场内部实施反倾销税，反倾销案件应由各国反垄断与竞争政策机构调查裁决；c) 四成员国采用统一的区域内贸易海关程序。,"Non tariff barriers, Regional trade agreements, Mercosur",2001-12-16
non-tariff measures,WTO Agricultural Tariffication with Lessons forTariffAdoption,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3078463,Jeong¡-Bin Im,"According to the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (URAA), all agricultural non-tariff trade barriers should be converted into equivalent tariffs and further, reduced over time. However each member country has the authority to choose the tariff types when it converts NTBs to tariffs such as ad valorem tariff and specific tariff. The paper tries to find the reason for the choice of a certain type of tariff in the process of tariffication after the UR negotiation on agriculture. To achieve this goal, the paper analyses the effects of tariffication of a fixed quota into tariffs on price, trade and welfare in a number of scenarios related to the sources of uncertainty. In this paper, we examine the nonequivalence of specific tariff and ad valorem tariff, which are general type of tariffs used in the most of countries. The paper has shown that the two types of tariffs selected by tariffication of import quota are not generally equivalent in both their effects on price and trade stability and welfare with the trade model under uncertainty. The main conclusion of this study is that there is no general presumption that one tariff regime is superior to the other tariff regime under conditions of uncertainty. The precise source of uncertainty and the properties of the relevant demand and supply functions might affect the determination of tariff type selected after tariffication of non-tariff barriers.",根据乌拉圭回合《农业协定》（URAA），所有农业非关税贸易壁垒都应转化为等效关税，并逐步降低。但各成员国在将非关税壁垒转为关税时有权选择从价税、从量税等税种。本文试图探究农业谈判后关税化过程中特定关税类型选择的成因。为此，我们通过贸易模型分析了固定配额关税化在不同不确定性来源情境下对价格、贸易及福利的影响，重点研究了各国普遍采用的从量税与从价税的非等效性。研究表明：在不确定性条件下，进口配额关税化形成的两种关税对价格稳定性、贸易稳定性及福利的影响均存在差异。本项研究的主要结论是：在不确定性条件下，无法笼统判定某种关税制度优于另一种关税制度。不确定性的具体来源及相关供需函数的特性，可能影响非关税壁垒关税化后关税类型的确定。,"WTO Agricultural Negotiation, Import Quota, Ad Valorem Tariff, Specific Tariff",2017-11-29

These reveal a steady and substantial movement towards adoption of similar approaches and illustrate that cooperation to reduce the trade-impeding effects of differences in RoO across jurisdictions is feasible.

Exploiting cross-sectoral variation in the timing and extent of regulatory harmonization, we find that harmonization waves correlate with rises in labor productivity and with higher markups, allowing self-financing of the adaptation process at the firm level. We identify an induced market-structure change that made the observed rise in markups possible. Namely, harmonization temporarily sheltered the Moroccan market from competition from low-end producers in other developing countries, who took time to adapt. We identified this effect through changes in both trade patterns and firm-level outcomes. Thus, harmonization apparently generated a self-financing adaptation process by affecting both firm-level incentives and market structure.",本文结合了关于非关税措施（NTMs）的新数据库与摩洛哥企业普查数据，探讨了与欧盟监管协调对企业层面结果的影响。通过利用监管协调在时间和程度上存在的跨行业差异，我们发现协调浪潮与劳动生产率的提升及更高利润率相关，使得企业能够自我融资适应过程。我们识别出一种诱导性的市场结构变化，这种变化使得观察到的利润率上升成为可能。具体而言，协调暂时保护了摩洛哥市场免受其他发展中国家低端生产商的竞争，这些生产商需要时间适应。我们通过贸易模式和企业层面结果的变化确认了这一效应。因此，监管协调显然通过影响企业层面的激励和市场结构，产生了一个自我融资的适应过程。,"firms, Harmonization, Morocco, Non-Tariff Measures, productivity, Profit, Trade",2017-01-23

This paper describes an economic framework to explain the pattern of remedies over non-tariff restrictions — particularly domestic subsidies and nonviolation complaints subject to liability rules. The key determinants of the contract form for any individual measure are the expected joint surplus from an agreement and the expected loss to the constrained government. The loss is higher for domestic subsidies and nonviolations because these are the policies most likely to correct domestic distortions. Governments choose property rules when expected gains from compliance are sufficiently high and expected losses to the constrained country are sufficiently low. Liability rules are preferable when dispute costs are relatively high, because inefficiencies in the compensation process reduce the number of socially inefficient disputes filed.",在贸易协定中，政府可设计补救措施以确保合规（财产规则）或补偿受害方（责任规则）。本文提出一个经济框架来解释针对非关税限制（尤其是受责任规则约束的国内补贴与非违规申诉）的补救模式选择规律。任何个体措施契约形式的核心决定因素在于：协定带来的预期联合盈余，以及受约束政府可能承受的预期损失。国内补贴与非违规情形造成的损失更大，因其最可能用于修正国内政策扭曲。当合规预期收益足够高且受约束国预期损失足够低时，政府会选择财产规则；而当争端解决成本较高时，责任规则更具优势——因为补偿过程中的效率损耗能减少社会效益低下的争端提起数量。,,2014-10-25

By reference to panel data of bilateral trade between China and 95 trade partners during 2006-2015, this paper probes into the impacts of overall and individual indicators of trade liberalization (i.e. tariff and non-tariff barriers) and trade facilitation (i.e. Infrastructure, E-Commerce, Financial Market, Government Regulation and Customs Environment) on China’s agricultural trade cost. Furthermore, the heterogeneity is analyzed in the “Belt and Road” countries and the non “Belt and Road” countries, developing countries and developed countries. The paper finds that perseverance in trade liberalization is an effective way to reduce agricultural trade cost, in which lifting of non-tariff barriers is a crux.

On a large sample of bilateral unit values for 2005, we find that about half of all HS-6 products demonstrate both significant quality-ladder effects and pricing-to-market effects, with quality-ladder effects predominating in importance.

Our analysis finds novel nonlinear impacts of tariff liberalization: Complete tariff elimination results in large additional trade gains - over and above tariff reductions - especially for intermediate goods.

To ensure food safety and environment safety, governments and some international institutions establish Maximum Residue Limitations (MRLs) to regulate the use of pesticides. However, the national regulation of MRLs varies from one to another. This had become a barrier to agricultural trade, and makes us difficult to measure the impact on agricultural trade.In this study, we construct a non-linear aggregation index—Bilateral Heterogeneity Index (BHI) to investigate the impact of regulatory heterogeneity of MRL on ASEAN’s fruits exports. According to the result, the regulatory heterogeneity of MRL between trading partners leads to the decrease of ASEAN’s fruit export, and the negative impact can partly be alleviated by the SPS cooperation under FTA framework. In addition, the impact of regulatory heterogeneity acts different for different entities: countries with small trading scale suffer much more negative impact than those large exporters.",卫生与植物检疫（SPS）是农产品贸易面临的最常见非关税措施之一。为确保食品安全和环境安全，各国政府及部分国际机构制定了最大残留限量（MRLs）以规范农药使用。然而各国对MRLs的监管标准存在差异，这已成为农产品贸易的壁垒，并使我们难以衡量其对贸易的影响。本研究构建了一个非线性聚合指标——双边异质性指数（BHI），用于探究MRLs监管差异对东盟水果出口的影响。结果表明，贸易伙伴间的MRLs监管差异会抑制东盟水果出口，而自贸区框架下的SPS合作能在一定程度上缓解这种负面影响。此外，监管差异对不同经济体的作用存在分化：贸易规模较小的国家所受负面影响远大于大型出口国。,"Maximum Residue Limitation, Gravity model, non-tariff measures, fruit export",2023-08-30

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are found to be high users of standard-like NTMs relative to other traditional measures to regulate trade. This begs the question if there has been an intentional shift towards murky protectionism in the region. Grounded on a few criterion to establish potential protectionism, the paper forwards the plausibility of “hidden” barriers in the standard-like NTMs in ASEAN, by drawing upon related secondary data and specific illustrative cases of “harmful” (discriminatory) and burdensome NTMs in the region. From the narrative experiences of ASEAN, it is inferred that procedural obstacles directly associated with a reported standard-like NTM, instead of the NTM itself, largely account for the “hidden” barriers in ASEAN. The paper concludes that irrespective of the motivation for the barriers, whether unintentional or intentional with a protectionist agenda, procedural obstacles deserve attention in their own right.",21世纪呈现出一种令人困扰的“新保护主义”情景，尤其是随着保护主义非关税措施（NTMs）的兴起。这主要指的是具有双重目的的标准类非关税措施（卫生与植物检疫措施及技术性贸易壁垒，分别简称SPS和TBT），既服务于非贸易政策目标，又隐含保护主义。研究发现，东南亚国家联盟（东盟）相较于其他传统贸易管制手段，更频繁使用标准类非关税措施。这引发了一个疑问：该地区是否存在向模糊保护主义刻意转变的趋势。基于几项判定潜在保护主义的标准，本文通过援引相关二手数据及该地区“有害”（歧视性）和繁冗非关税措施的具体案例，提出了东盟标准类非关税措施中存在“隐性”壁垒的可能性。从东盟的叙事经验可推断，与报告所述标准类非关税措施直接相关的程序性障碍（而非措施本身）在很大程度上构成了该地区的“隐性”壁垒。本文结论认为，无论这些壁垒的动机是出于无意还是带有保护主义意图，程序性障碍本身就值得重点关注。,Standard-Like Non-Tariff Measures; Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures; Technical Barriers to Trade; Protectionism; Procedural Obstacles; ASEAN,2018-07-08

While traditional trade theory focused on the country, and the new trade theory of the 1980’s adopted the industry as the unit for analysis, the newest theory emphasizes the role of firms and firm heterogeneity in international trade. We describe insights from this reformulation of theory and the empirical literature that illuminates it. The realities of trade as now understood show the need for a new new trade policy. Evaluating trade at the level of the firm implies that overcoming firm-level fixed costs of trade and reducing uncertainty lead to increased trade along margins that generate the highest productivity, innovation, and welfare gains. The traditional market access agenda ought now to be less important on the multilateral agenda than services, standards, trade facilitation, procurement, and innovation policy. The analytical needs of a new new trade policy require new models and more access to firm-level data to formulate and evaluate the multi-faceted impacts of trade policy.",本文探讨了基于企业的贸易理论和实证研究最新进展对贸易政策与谈判的影响。传统贸易理论以国家为研究对象，20世纪80年代的新贸易理论将产业作为分析单元，而最新理论则强调企业及其异质性在国际贸易中的作用。我们阐述了这一理论重构及其相关实证研究带来的启示。当前对贸易现实的理解表明，我们需要一种全新的贸易政策。从企业层面评估贸易意味着，克服企业层面的贸易固定成本并降低不确定性，能够促进那些带来最高生产率、创新和福利增长的贸易边际扩张。与传统的市场准入议题相比，服务贸易、标准制定、贸易便利化、政府采购和创新政策如今应在多边议程中占据更重要的地位。实施新型贸易政策需要建立新模型，并提高企业层面数据的可获取性，以全面评估贸易政策的多维影响。,,2011-04-19

All stakeholders in the drugs debate share the goal of a policy and legal structures that maximize social, environmental, physical and psychological well-being. However, the debate around improving drug policy has been emotive, polarized and deadlocked. Proponents of different views of the best way forward tend to focus on the arguments and evidence that support their perspective. In this context, national governments and international agencies need to take a structured approach to assessing the best mix of evidence-based drug policies to promote human development, human security and human rights. Impact Assessment methodologies provide a potential mechanism for conducting an independent, neutral analysis that all stakeholders can support. These methodologies have been used to great effect in other policy areas, comparing the economic, environmental and social costs and benefits of existing policies against a full range of alternatives. For an Impact Assessment of drug policy, these alternatives should include more intensive/punitive enforcement approaches, as well as options for decriminalization of personal use, and models for legal regulation of drug production and supply. The historic nature of the drug policy debate has meant that policy development has often lacked objective scrutiny. By rationally and methodically focusing on the evidence, in terms of costs and benefits of different options, and using established methodologies already embedded in most governments’ processes, IA brings drug policy back into the arena of science, avoiding the polarizing clashes that have long defined the debate. A call for IA is essentially a call for better evidence, and a structured approach to assessing policy options to inform debate and determine the best way forward. As such it is politically neutral, and a very reasonable request to policy makers. At the very least, carrying out IAS on key elements of drug policy would for the first time allow taxpayers to judge how well their money was being spent. At best, it would provide an opportunity to move to a genuinely science based drug policy that promotes human development, human security and human rights, and is fit for the challenges of the 21st Century.",本简报呼吁对毒品政策进行迫切需要的效果评估。毒品辩论中的所有利益相关方都追求一个共同目标：制定能最大限度提升社会、环境、身体及心理福祉的政策与法律框架。然而关于改进毒品政策的讨论长期充满情绪化、两极化和僵持不下的特点。不同主张的支持者往往只关注能佐证自身观点的论据。在此背景下，各国政府与国际机构需要采用系统化方法，评估促进人类发展、安全与人权的最优证据型政策组合。效果评估方法论为开展独立中立、能获得各方认可的分析提供了可行机制——该方法已在其他政策领域取得显著成效，通过全面对比现行政策与替代方案的经济、环境及社会成本效益来实现政策优化。就毒品政策的效果评估而言，替代方案应涵盖更严厉的惩戒执法措施、个人使用非罪化选项，以及毒品生产与供应合法监管模式等多重路径。毒品政策辩论的历史特性导致政策制定往往缺乏客观审视。通过系统聚焦不同选项的成本效益证据，运用已被各国政府采纳的成熟方法论，效果评估能将毒品政策重新纳入科学范畴，避免长期存在的立场对立。呼吁开展效果评估本质上是呼吁以更优质的证据和结构化政策评估方法来引导辩论、确定最优路径。这种要求具有政治中立性，是对决策者非常合理的诉求。至少，对毒品政策关键要素开展效果评估将首次让纳税人能判断资金使用成效；而最理想的情况是，这将推动建立真正以科学为基础、促进人类发展安全与人权、能应对21世纪挑战的毒品政策体系。,"international policy, national policy, policy evaluation",2011-08-15

He is unpredictable, but less so on trade. Trump has been consistently advancing “Make America Great Again” by calling for trade that puts the United States (hereinafter “U.S.”) interests first. He views multilateral trade agreements as instruments that weaken American leverage. His rhetoric has matched substantive policy changes (e.g., renegotiation of North American Free Trade Agreement　(hereinafter “NAFTA”), withdrawal from Trans-Pacific Partnership (hereinafter “TPP”). This will continue. Trump has deal making capabilities and will probably seek to sign bilateral free trade agreements with willing partners who can commit to terms quickly. However, this will not be easy. Although he has spoken tough on China, he has thus far stopped — albeit just — in acting tough. Trump is currently adopting a “wait and see” approach. Hence, it is important, especially when analysing Trump’s behaviour with China, to discern between rhetoric and reality.

In this study, policymakers are assumed to minimize the political costs of changing domestic prices and deviating from political-economy equilibria. Error correction techniques applied to price data for rice and wheat collected to measure trade policy distortions allow estimation of policy response parameters. The results suggest that systematic short-run price insulation reduces shocks to domestic prices but magnifies world price volatility and the costs of trade distortions. However, idiosyncratic domestic price shocks increase domestic price volatility relative to the magnified volatility of world prices. The results change our understanding of price insulation—from a zero-sum game where some reduce price volatility at the expense of their neighbors, into a negative-sum game with higher price volatility in most countries. Policy reforms could lower costs, reduce price volatility, and facilitate reform of international trade rules.",许多国家的食品贸易壁垒会系统性调整，以隔绝国内市场免受国际价格波动影响。本研究假设政策制定者致力于最小化国内价格变动与偏离政治经济均衡所带来的政治成本。通过运用误差修正技术分析大米和小麦价格数据（这些数据用于衡量贸易政策扭曲），我们得以估算政策响应参数。结果显示，系统性的短期价格隔离虽能降低国内价格冲击，却会放大国际价格波动和贸易扭曲成本。然而，特殊的国内价格冲击会相对加剧国内价格波动，使其超过已被放大的国际价格波动。这些发现改变了我们对价格隔离的认知——从以邻为壑的零和博弈（部分国家通过牺牲他国利益降低自身价格波动），转变为多数国家价格波动加剧的负和博弈。政策改革有望降低成本、缓解价格波动，并推动国际贸易规则改革。,"trade policy, food prices, behavioral economics, econometric models, food price volatility",2024-06-24

Examining some of the key developments in China's trade policy and regime, it argues that neither free trade nor protectionsim is the complete answer to development; in China's experience, a ""pragmatic"" trade policy requires a delicate balance between liberalization and use of industrial policy to support selected economic sectors.","中国的迅速崛起正在快速重塑世界经济。从贸易和发展的角度来看，是什么解释了中国非凡的增长？就其贸易和投资政策的性质及影响而言，中国对许多观察者来说仍是一个谜，并持续成为激烈辩论的话题。本文的主要目的是从贸易和发展的角度对中国对外贸易政策的演变进行分析。通过考察中国贸易政策和体制中的一些关键发展，本文认为自由贸易和保护主义都不是发展的完整答案；根据中国的经验，""务实""的贸易政策需要在自由化和利用产业政策支持特定经济部门之间取得微妙的平衡。","China, international trade, foreign trade, trade policy, trade liberalization, trade protection",2008-04-29

For this purpose, Chapter 2 of this study characterizes main features of recent changes in the world economic and trade order. A strong focus was given here to the analysis of the trends and implications of ‘global value chains (GVCs)’ and ‘re-shoring’, as well as the changes in the multilateral and regional trading system. Chapter 3 then was devoted to the detailed investigation of new developments in US trade policy and the proliferation of the new protectionism, which have been identified as most significant threats to the outward-oriented economies like Korea. Based on the analysis  of chapters 2 and 3, Chapter 4 identifies five challenges facing the Korean economy that bear relevance to trade policy. Based on the insights earned through the previous chapters, Chapter 5 developed the basic framework for the future direction of Korea’s trade policy. Especially, this study presented 3 long-term visions for Korea’s trade policy: ① establishment of an advanced structure of Korea’s trade policy, ② adoption of an inclusive trade policy, and ③ trade policy contributing to the stability of international trade order. Based on these three visions, the research team successfully derived five trade-policy tasks and 9 actions plans.

Simplistic ‘war on drugs’ strategies have failed in their key objectives of eradicating illicit drug markets and reducing the prevalence of drug use. At the same time, there is increasing evidence that the current drug control regime has caused severe negative consequences for development, public health and human rights. A growing number of governments are considering alternative policy options to address the harms associated with drug markets and use. The IDPC Drug Policy Guide brings together global evidence and examples of best practice to provide guidance on the review, design and implementation of drug policies. The Guide is designed to assist national policy makers in the process of developing effective, humane and appropriate drug policies and programmes for their country. Each chapter of the Guide introduces a specific type of policy challenge, analyses existing evidence and experiences of different countries, and presents advice and recommendations for developing effective policy responses. This is the second edition of our Guide, now available in English, Spanish, French, Indonesia Bahasa and Chinese.

trade policy,The Evolution of ServicesTradePolicySince the Great Recession,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3616474,Ingo Borchert,"Are changes in services markets provoking reform, restrictions, or inertia? To address this question, this paper draws on a new World Bank-World Trade Organization Services Trade Policy Database. The paper analyzes the services trade policies of 68 economies in 23 subsectors across five broad areas -- financial services, telecommunications, distribution, transportation, and professional services. Policy measures are quantified into a Services Trade Restrictions Index (STRI) following a novel, consistent and transparent framework. The paper identifies patterns of services trade policies across sectors and economies, and secular trends over the past decade. Higher income economies are still more open on average than developing economies, but the chronology of reform differs markedly across sectors. In telecommunications and finance, there is convergence toward greater openness driven by liberalization in the previously more restrictive developing economies. In the hitherto universally protected transport and professional services, there is policy divergence, as some higher income economies pioneer reform. But while explicit restrictions are being lowered in most services sectors?in contrast to recent developments in goods trade policy -- there is greater recourse to regulatory scrutiny, especially in higher income economies. These measures could reflect legitimate prudential or security concerns, but they could also reflect recourse to less transparent forms of protection.",服务业市场的变化正在引发改革、限制还是惰性？为解答这一问题，本文采用了世界银行与世贸组织新建立的服务贸易政策数据库。研究分析了68个经济体在五大领域（金融服务、电信、分销、运输及专业服务）23个子部门的服务贸易政策，并依据创新性、一致且透明的框架，将政策措施量化为服务贸易限制指数（STRI）。本文揭示了不同部门和经济体间的服务贸易政策模式，以及过去十年的长期趋势。高收入经济体平均仍比发展中经济体更开放，但各领域的改革时序差异显著：电信和金融领域呈现开放度趋同态势，这主要源于原先限制较多的发展中经济体推行自由化；而在长期受普遍保护的运输和专业服务领域，政策出现分化，部分高收入经济体率先实施改革。值得注意的是，尽管多数服务部门的显性限制正在减少（与近期货物贸易政策动向形成反差），但监管审查措施的使用频率增加，这种现象在高收入经济体尤为突出。此类措施可能反映合理的审慎或安全考量，但也可能成为转向更隐蔽保护形式的信号。,"International Trade and Trade Rules, Transport Services, Trade Policy, Rules of Origin, Trade and Multilateral Issues, Telecommunications Infrastructure",2020-06-03
trade policy,TradePolicyat the Crossroads - The Indonesian Story,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1280785,David Vanzetti,"Following the crises of the late 1990s and the subsequent slowdown in the world economy, many countries in the developed and developing world are at the crossroads in their trade strategy, uncertain whether to advance with trade reforms, to stand still or increase protection. While the case for liberalization has been widely accepted as a long-term goal for economic policy, the gains from trade have not always been forthcoming and macroeconomic crises have exacerbated the situation. The delayed and uncertain benefits of reform, plus the costs of adjustment, the need to offset tariff revenue losses, and the possible benefits of some degree of intervention to foster industrialization have all contributed to this indecision. Support for the WTO multilateral negotiations now appears half-hearted, and there are calls for increased protection. Following the slow progress of multilateral negotiations, attention has inevitably turned to regional and bilateral agreements. Indonesia provides an interesting case study of the potential benefits and costs of alternative trade strategies that are under active consideration in many developing countries. The ASEAN region has recently announced a deepening of its commitments and is considering widening the agreement to include countries such as China, Japan and the Republic of Korea. A bilateral agreement with the United States is also a possibility. Against this background, Indonesia's options on trade policy range from increasing protection to actively pursuing bilateral, regional and multilateral initiatives. The results of a global general equilibrium analysis point to several interesting implications for policy makers. The results from the model show that increasing protection results in economic losses while a stand still and more liberalization produces economic gains. After undergoing full adjustment, estimated annual gains to Indonesia from a conservative Uruguay Round-style outcome within the WTO system total an estimated $380 million (0.22 per cent of GDP). However, annual gains from a completely liberalized ASEAN plus China, Japan and Republic of Korea regional trade agreement are estimated at $2.3 billion, again after adjustment. Indonesia could capture half of these benefits by liberalizing unilaterally. The major source of the gains from unilateral, regional and multilateral liberalization is improved efficiency following removal of tariffs on politically sensitive sectors such as motor vehicles. This improves productivity in many downstream sectors. There are significant trade diversion effects from regional integration, with non-members worse off as a result. The results have implications for other countries having second thoughts about their strategy.",20世纪90年代末的危机及随后世界经济的放缓，使许多发达国家和发展中国家在贸易战略上处于十字路口，不确定是推进贸易改革、维持现状还是加强保护。尽管自由化作为经济政策的长期目标已被广泛接受，但贸易收益并不总能如期而至，宏观经济危机更使情况恶化。改革效益的延迟与不确定性、调整成本、弥补关税收入损失的需求，以及一定程度干预促进工业化的潜在好处，共同导致了这种犹豫不决。当前对WTO多边谈判的支持显得三心二意，要求加强保护的呼声渐起。随着多边谈判进展缓慢，注意力不可避免地转向区域和双边协定。印度尼西亚为许多发展中国家正在积极考虑的不同贸易战略的潜在收益与成本提供了有趣案例。东盟地区近期宣布深化承诺，并考虑扩大协定范围以纳入中国、日本和韩国等国家。与美国达成双边协定也是一种可能。在此背景下，印度尼西亚的贸易政策选择范围从加强保护到积极推动双边、区域和多边倡议不等。全球一般均衡分析结果对政策制定者揭示了若干重要启示：模型显示加强保护会导致经济损失，而维持现状和进一步自由化则带来经济收益。在充分调整后，印度尼西亚在WTO体系内保守的乌拉圭回合式方案中预计年收益达3.8亿美元（占GDP的0.22%）。但若实现东盟与中国、日本及韩国完全自由化的区域贸易协定，经调整后年收益预计可达23亿美元。通过单边自由化，印度尼西亚可获取其中半数收益。单边、区域和多边自由化的主要收益来源，在于取消汽车等政治敏感行业的关税后带来的效率提升，这促进了许多下游行业的生产力提高。区域一体化会产生显著的贸易转移效应，使非成员国处境恶化。这些结论对其他重新审视自身战略的国家具有启示意义。,"Trade policy, WTO negotiations, regional trade agreements, Indonesia, ASEAN",2008-10-08

trade policy,IndustrialPolicyand the WorldTradeOrganization: Between Legal Constraints and Flexibilities (Introduction),https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3319563,Sherzod Shadikhodjaev,"A series of “industrial revolutions” taking place from the eighteenth century onward has changed the production process tremendously. The first industrial revolution mechanized manufacturing with water and steam power, marking a historic shift from a manual to machinery-based production. The second one used electricity for mass production. The third or “digital” revolution automated production through the incorporation of electronics and information technology (IT). The current fourth industrial revolution builds on the digital revolution and creates a fusion of technologies – for example, artificial intelligence, the Internet of things, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, and so on – cutting across the physical, digital, and biological domains.Industrialization without any government’s involvement is hardly conceivable. In practice, many governments have played an undeniable role in establishing, stimulating, and protecting domestic industries even when it was contrary to market principles. Such a government’s participation is captured by the concept of “industrial policy,” which itself has never been defined in a commonly acceptable manner. The severe global financial crisis of 2008 could not be overcome without government interventions through industrial policy.This timely book analyzes industrial policy from the perspectives of trade law and economics under the WTO system. The author expertly examines both general tools of protecting and supporting domestic producers and specific topics like special economic zones, localization, greening measures, and creative economy. In addition to legal texts and jurisprudence, this book extensively utilizes other WTO materials to show what is actually discussed in WTO meetings and forums on relevant issues. Where applicable, the author advances practical recommendations for “right” or “optimal” industrial policy in certain contexts based on trade rules, case law, and some countries’ real experiences. The author concludes this work with some thoughts on concrete actions to be taken at the WTO and national levels and in academic circles in order to better tackle industrial policy issues.",自18世纪以来发生的一系列“工业革命”极大地改变了生产过程。第一次工业革命利用水和蒸汽动力实现了制造业的机械化，标志着从手工生产向机械生产的历史性转变。第二次工业革命则利用电力实现了大规模生产。第三次即“数字”革命通过引入电子和信息技术（IT）实现了生产自动化。当前的第四次工业革命以数字革命为基础，融合了人工智能、物联网、3D打印、纳米技术、生物技术等多种技术，跨越了物理、数字和生物领域。  . . 没有政府参与的工业化几乎难以想象。实际上，许多政府在建立、刺激和保护国内产业方面发挥了不可否认的作用，即使这些做法有时违背市场原则。这种政府参与被概括为“产业政策”的概念，而产业政策本身从未有一个普遍接受的定义。2008年严重的全球金融危机若没有政府通过产业政策的干预，是无法克服的。  . . 这本适时出版的著作从WTO体系下的贸易法和经济学角度分析了产业政策。作者深入探讨了保护和扶持国内生产者的通用工具，以及经济特区、本地化要求、绿色措施和创意经济等具体议题。除了法律文本和判例外，本书还广泛引用了WTO的其他材料，以展示在WTO会议和论坛上实际讨论的相关议题。在适当情况下，作者基于贸易规则、判例法以及一些国家的实际经验，提出了在某些情境下“正确”或“最优”产业政策的实用建议。最后，作者总结了一些在WTO、国家层面以及学术界可以采取的具体行动，以更好地应对产业政策问题。,"industrial policy, fourth (4th) industrial revolution, WTO, trade rules, policy space, flexiblities",2019-02-04
trade policy,Digital Disruption and the Reshaping of Markets for IP: What this Means forTrade& CompetitionPolicy,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3857808,Antony Scott Taubman,"The intellectual property (IP) system is, in broad terms, a public policy instrument deployed to remedy the perceived market failure caused by the appropriability of socially beneficial knowledge products. IP rights (IPRs) create a means to enable others to be excluded from what would otherwise be non-excludable knowledge goods, and in turn this right to exclude creates both an incentive to invest in the creation of new knowledge goods, and a means of negotiating over and trading in such knowledge goods. Establishing IPRs as rights to exclude does, by its very nature, constrain the actions of a right holder's competitors, but this constraint on static economic efficiency is – in principle – justified because of the dynamic benefits arising from innovation – both the creation of new knowledge and (what should perhaps be emphasized more than it typically is) the putting to work of new knowledge.That is, at least, the conventional rationale for IP protection in a domestic public policy setting (although the conception of 'IP' in such a context is very limited, and overlooks other policy rationales of the wider IP system, such as consumer protection and the promotion of product differentiation, as well as the entitlement of such creative workers as performers to secure an equitable income1F ). Thus, in this abstracted conception, the IP system intervenes to redefine competitive relations between firms in the expectation of improved social and economic welfare gains overall for a society. Overprotection and under-protection of IP arise, respectively, when excludability of knowledge goods excessively constrains legitimate competition and when there is insufficient rationale to invest and deal in new knowledge products.That is the domestic dimension, as it's conventionally framed.  On the international plane, the rationale for inclusion of IP rules within the multilateral trade law system, in the form of the WTO TRIPS Agreement, draws on a conception of 'legitimate trade' and the objective of reducing 'distortions and impediments to international trade.' Broadly construed, the text of the TRIPS Agreement, for the most part settled by late 1991, represents, in effect, an endeavour to establish a settled balance between positive rules that would shape a mutually beneficial international marketplace for knowledge products and IP-rich goods and services, while providing for sufficient domestic latitude for governments to take action to safeguard public policy objectives.Hence, at both domestic and international regulatory levels, IP norms aim to shape the market to an extent, with a view to promoting dynamic efficiency, reducing suboptimal forms of competition (variously construed as free-riding, market failure, illegitimate trade, or distortions to trade), and enabling sufficient scope for regulatory diversity and measures to enhance public policy. The text of the TRIPS Agreement represents one conception of how this form of market regulation should be shaped, from the perspective of the early 1990s.3F  Since that time, the dissemination and increasingly rapid uptake of digital technologies has dramatically transformed the ways in which IP is defined, managed, traded, administered and enforced. This 'digital disruption' has recalibrated the balance of interests between competing firms, and between firms and the general public; further, it has created entirely new and ever-diversifying ways of dealing in IP and trading internationally through business models that rely on IP protection.This paper reviews the implications of this digital disruption for the three-way interaction between IP policy, competition policy, and international trade policy: it raises the question of whether digital disruption has ultimately validated the enduring legitimacy, dynamism and effectiveness of this balance, or is necessitating a fundamental recalibration of legal and policy tools forged in an earlier, 'analogue' age.","知识产权（IP）体系广义上是一种公共政策工具，旨在解决因社会有益知识产品可专有性导致的市场失灵问题。知识产权（IPRs）通过建立排他性机制，使原本非排他性的知识产品能够限制他人使用，这种排他权既激励了对新知识产品的投资创造，也为知识产品的协商与交易提供了途径。将知识产权确立为排他权本质上会限制权利持有者竞争者的行为，但这种对静态经济效率的限制在原则上具有合理性——因为它能带来创新的动态效益，包括新知识的创造以及（这一点通常未得到足够重视）新知识的实际运用。这至少是国内公共政策背景下知识产权保护的传统理论基础（尽管这种语境下的""知识产权""概念非常局限，忽略了更广泛知识产权体系的其他政策依据，如消费者保护、促进产品差异化，以及表演者等创意工作者获取公平收入的权益1F）。因此，在这种抽象概念中，知识产权体系通过重新定义企业间的竞争关系进行干预，以期实现社会整体经济福利的提升。当知识产品的排他性过度限制正当竞争时，就会产生知识产权过度保护；当缺乏投资和交易新知识产品的充分理由时，则会出现保护不足——这是传统框架下的国内维度。. . 在国际层面，将知识产权规则纳入以WTO《TRIPS协定》为代表的多边贸易法律体系，其理论基础源自""合法贸易""理念及减少""国际贸易扭曲与阻碍""的目标。1991年底基本定稿的《TRIPS协定》文本，本质上试图在两方面建立稳定平衡：既通过积极规则塑造互利互惠的知识产品及知识产权密集型商品与服务的国际市场，又为各国政府保留维护公共政策目标的国内施策空间。因此，无论在国内还是国际监管层面，知识产权规范都旨在一定程度塑造市场，以促进动态效率、减少次优竞争形式（可解读为搭便车、市场失灵、非法贸易或贸易扭曲），并为监管多样性及公共政策促进措施提供充分空间。《TRIPS协定》文本体现了1990年代初关于这种市场规制形态的构想3F。. . 此后数字技术的传播与加速普及彻底改变了知识产权的定义、管理、交易、行政与执法方式。这种""数字颠覆""重新调整了竞争企业之间、企业与公众之间的利益平衡，更通过依赖知识产权保护的商业模式，催生了处理知识产权及开展国际贸易的全新且持续多元化的途径。本文审视这种数字颠覆对知识产权政策、竞争政策与国际贸易政策三者互动关系的影响：探讨数字颠覆究竟是最终验证了这种平衡具有持久合法性、活力与有效性，还是迫切需要从根本上重新调整形成于早期""模拟时代""的法律与政策工具。","intellectual property, digital trade, competition policy, TRIPS Agreement",2021-06-03

trade policy,PolicyAnchors: Do FreeTradeAgreements and WTO Accessions Serve as Vehicles for Developing-CountryPolicyReform?,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=895272,Michael J. Ferrantino,"It is sometimes claimed that free trade agreements (FTAs) between large countries and smaller developing countries serve as ""policy anchors"" by acting as a mechanism for the smaller developing country to make credible commitments to policy reform which they might not otherwise make.  Such policy commitments are likely to take place while the agreement is being negotiated.  This paper presents some stylized facts about recent U.S. FTAs and recent accessions to the WTO which may be relevant in assessing the claim that either process acts as a ""policy anchor"".  These include the following: (1) U.S. FTAs are generally negotiated much more quickly than WTO accessions.  (2) The length of time it takes to negotiate an FTA or accession varies widely.  Agreements with larger economies and economies with weaker initial policies appear to take longer.  (3) Recent U.S. FTA partners begin negotiations with a stronger policy environment than recent WTO accession candidates, indicating a selectivity phenomenon.  (4) An analysis using the World Bank's ""Governance Matters"" indicators shows no apparent relationship between the period of negotiation or engagement and improved governance.  The trade component of the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom does show a consistent pattern of improvement, but other sub-indicators are likely to deteriorate.  (5) Particular experiences are likely to be highly country-specific.","有一种观点认为，大型国家与较小发展中国家之间的自由贸易协定（FTA）可作为""政策锚""，通过这一机制，较小的发展中国家能够对其可能不会实施的政策改革作出可信承诺。此类政策承诺往往在协议谈判期间形成。本文通过梳理近期美国自由贸易协定及世贸组织新成员加入案例的典型事实，为评估这两种进程是否发挥""政策锚""作用提供参考依据。主要发现包括：（1）美国自由贸易协定的谈判周期通常远短于世贸组织加入程序；（2）不同国家完成自贸协定谈判或入世谈判的时间差异显著，初始政策环境较弱的大型经济体耗时更长；（3）近期美国自贸伙伴在谈判启动时的政策环境优于同期世贸组织申请国，存在选择性现象；（4）世界银行""治理指标""分析显示谈判或参与周期与治理水平提升无显著关联，传统基金会经济自由指数中的贸易指标虽呈现持续改善，但其他分项指标可能恶化；（5）具体效果具有显著国别差异性。","WTO, FTAs, policy reform, governance",2006-04-11

trade policy,Environmental Awareness Training for Pilots,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3777375,Marina Efthymiou,"Sustainability and, more specifically, climate change is integral to the policy agenda and strategic priorities of the aviation industry. While the global aviation industry produces approximately 2% of all human-induced carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (ATAG, 2020; European Commission, 2020), airlines have committed to cut net carbon emissions in half by 2050 with innovative technologies, sustainable aviation fuel and improved operations and infrastructures. This paper addresses changes that can be implemented in the aviation pilot training domain to support the sustainability focus and action of our industry. There is no specific technical knowledge or practical training content in any current EASA pilot license that addresses environmental considerations; there is, however, a positive causality between environmental awareness training and environmentally aware behaviour. Environmental and health concerns caused by the aviation industry is a major political topic. Although technical innovation and the development of ecologically-conscious operational procedures and infrastructure have improved the environmental footprint of aviation, pilot training has yet to recognise and embrace the requirement for ecologically friendly flight operations. There is no specific technical knowledge or practical training content in any current EASA pilot license that addresses environmental considerations; there is, however, a positive causality between environmental awareness training and environmentally aware behaviour.In the context of aviation’s environmental performance this paper proposes three aspects of pilot training that should be subject to the mandated inclusion of environmental awareness training:1. Mandate training that enhances environmental awareness for all categories of pilot licenses. This includes academic knowledge and practical training. Environmental awareness operations should be fully integrated into the established threat and error management (TEM) philosophy and process.2. Re-evaluate and optimise the distribution of training time (sessions / hours) spent on aircraft versus FSTDs. Perform a careful analysis of training merit in these two different practical training media; measurement should be based on the current EASA EBT competency framework for aeroplane pilots.3. Accelerate distance and blended learning training options with full credits to license curricula.

Those Reviews show that trade liberalization came hand-in-hand with internal reforms, and was generally of an autonomous nature and an intrinsic component of improved economic management. Trade liberalization slowed down during the second decade under review, with tariffs having come down mostly during the earlier years. The use of non-tariff barriers also fell over time although at a slow pace in some of the smallest Members, which found it difficult to implement the more complex trade policy instrument applied by larger countries. Export and other government assistance schemes proliferated throughout the continent but were often characterized by a lack of unity in the criteria used to assign and apply them. The review period also witnessed enormous changes in the services sectors, where reforms usually proved more complex than in the goods area. The multilateral and other international trade agreements contributed to the stability of trade policies and the general rejection of protectionism, although backtracking did occur in a number of cases. Because the commitments made during the Uruguay Round negotiation now fall short of the more liberal trade regimes that came to be over the review period, most Members in the Americas could presently raise trade and investment barriers without violating multilateral rules.  Thus, the pressing need to conclude the Doha Development Agenda in order to lock in the considerable trade policy liberalization achieved during past years, and to strengthen the multilateral trading system.",1989至2009年间西半球开展的贸易政策审议包含大量信息，清晰展现了贸易政策审议机制运作头二十年里多数美洲国家取得的显著进步。这些审议表明，贸易自由化与内部改革同步推进，通常具有自主性质，并成为改进经济管理的内在组成部分。在审议涵盖的第二个十年中，随着关税主要在早些年下降，贸易自由化步伐有所放缓。非关税壁垒的使用也随时间推移而减少，不过在一些最小成员中进展缓慢，它们发现难以实施大国采用的更复杂贸易政策工具。整个美洲大陆出口和其他政府援助计划激增，但这些计划的分配和实施标准往往缺乏统一性。审议期间服务领域也发生巨大变革，这些领域的改革通常比货物领域更为复杂。多边及其他国际贸易协定促进了贸易政策稳定和普遍抵制保护主义，尽管一些情况确实出现倒退。由于乌拉圭回合谈判期间作出的承诺如今已不及审议期间形成的更自由贸易体制，美洲多数成员目前可以在不违反多边规则的情况下提高贸易和投资壁垒。因此迫切需要完成多哈发展议程，以巩固过去多年取得的重大贸易政策自由化成果，并加强多边贸易体系。,"Commercial Policy, GATT WTO, Liberalization, Integration, History",2011-01-18

In particular, the following three areas are of interest in this brief.First, the achievements and limitations of the current multilateral trading system, represented by the WTO are reviewed. Even though the WTO, the legitimate heir and successor of the GATT regime, began with great ambition for greater trade liberalization, its first negotiation round, the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), has failed to deliver as many outcomes as it was expected to. Reasons for such hardship and challenges the WTO faces are examined.Second, this brief asks the implications of the recent WTO reform efforts led by advanced economies such as the U.S, EU, Canada, and Japan. The current WTO reform efforts are different from previous reform discussions in that they are based on more specific demands and requests. Facing such difference in reform efforts, the strategies and policy options of Korean government to respond to such movement are mulled over.Third, an extensive guideline for Korea's multilateral trade policy are suggested.

Trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) figure in the new plan but less reliance is placed on FDI inflows than in the past and as much emphasis appears to be placed on import substitution as on export expansion to reduce the trade deficit. Ethiopia has tried different trade strategies in the past, the perennial goal being to diversify its exports to reduce dependence on coffee and other cash crops. Nonetheless, Ethiopia has a low share of trade in GDP, its exports continue to have limited diversification, and its trade deficit has widened significantly. This paper argues that Ethiopia’s trade performance has been held back by a combination of factors that are amenable to policy treatment, including very high trade costs due to poor trade logistics and burdensome official requirements, an unsupportive macroeconomic policy mix, and private sector under-development that is at least partially attributable to weaknesses in the microeconomic framework. By the same token, it argues that targeted infrastructure and regional cooperation developments, in conjunction with a trade friendly macroeconomic policy and domestic administrative reforms would, properly sequenced, enable Ethiopia to use its abundant factor of production – cheap labour – to drive its development on a basis less vulnerable to the risks inherent in rain-based agricultural production, including participation in processing trade.

This book, which deals with the institutional framework of EC trade law, and with special emphasis on services trade, examines the law and practice of EC external trade relations from a policy, economic, and legal angle, with a European Union (EU) constitutional dimension. The major point of analysis is to find ways to ensure the unitary character of EC external trade relations in areas of shared competence between EU Member States and EU institutions, as well as to understand the management of the EC's external trade relations. The book begins with an analysis of the evolution of the EC common commercial policy, through which the author examines the checks and balances at the micro, meso, and macro levels. The problem of the EU in its external relations and the legal complexity of mixed agreements are then analyzed. This unique legal phenomenon is tackled from an intra-EC perspective as well as from its external dimension, where its various implications for third parties are taken into account. The major EU institutions are examined: the Commission as the negotiator of international trade agreements, the EU Council and the European Parliament for the conclusion and ratification of agreements, and the European Court of Justice in relation to judicial enforcement.

trade policy,DeepTradeAgreements and Global Value Chains,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3238329,Edith Laget,"Preferential trade agreements have become deeper over time, often encompassing policy areas that go beyond traditional trade policy, such as investment, competition, and intellectual property rights protection. In the literature, a prominent argument why countries sign ""deep"" agreements is to promote and facilitate the operation of global value chains. This paper exploits a new data set on the content of trade agreements and data on trade in value added and in parts and components, to quantify the impact of the depth of trade agreements on bilateral cross-border production linkages. The results show that adding a policy area to a trade agreement increases the domestic value added of intermediates (forward global value chain linkages) and the foreign value added of intermediates (backward global value chain linkages) by 0.48 and 0.38 percent, respectively. At the sectoral level, the positive impact of deep trade agreements is higher for higher value-added industries, suggesting that deep agreements help countries to integrate in industries with higher levels of value added. For a larger sample of countries and years, the results confirm that an additional provision in a trade agreement increases bilateral trade in parts and components by 0.3 percent. The content of trade agreements also matters for global value chain integration, but the impact varies by income group. Provisions outside the current mandate of the World Trade Organization (investment and competition policy) drive the effect of trade agreements on North-South trade in parts and components. Provisions under the current World Trade Organization mandate (tariff reduction and customs facilitation) drive the effect of trade agreements on South-South trade in parts and components.","随着时间的推移，优惠贸易协定不断深化，通常涵盖投资、竞争和知识产权保护等超越传统贸易政策的领域。现有研究提出一个重要观点，即各国签署""深度""协定是为了促进和便利全球价值链的运作。本文利用贸易协定内容的新数据集以及增加值贸易和零部件贸易数据，量化了贸易协定深度对双边跨境生产联系的影响。研究表明，在贸易协定中增加一个政策领域，可使中间产品的国内增加值（前向全球价值链联系）和中间产品的国外增加值（后向全球价值链联系）分别提高0.48%和0.38%。在行业层面，深度贸易协定对高附加值行业的积极影响更大，这表明深度协定有助于各国融入附加值水平更高的行业。在更大范围的国家和年份样本中，结果证实贸易协定每增加一项条款，双边零部件贸易就会增长0.3%。贸易协定的内容对全球价值链整合也很重要，但影响因收入群体而异。世界贸易组织现行授权范围之外的条款（投资和竞争政策）推动了贸易协定对南北零部件贸易的影响。世界贸易组织现行授权范围内的条款（关税减让和海关便利化）则推动了贸易协定对南南零部件贸易的影响。","International Trade and Trade Rules, Industrial and Consumer Services and Products, Transport and Trade Logistics, Competition Policy, Competitiveness and Competition Policy, Trade Finance and Investment",2018-08-28

trade policy,저탄소 녹색성장정책과 다자무역규범 간의 조화:주요 쟁점과 정책 시사점 (Korea's Green GrowthPolicyand MultilateralTradeRules: Harmonization Issues andPolicyImplications),https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2317802,Sherzod Shadikhodjaev,"제2차 세계대전 이후부터 지금까지 꾸준한 성장을 이어온 국제교역은 세계 GDP의 25%를 차지 할 만큼 경제발전에 긍정적인 영향을 주었지만, 동시에 세계 이산화탄소 배출량의 약 21.5%가 국제무역에 의해 발생한다는 점에서 환경적으로는 부정적 영향을 미쳐 왔습니다. 또한 지난 수십 년간 전 세계적으로 이루어지고 있는 산업화와 같은 인간활동으로 인해 자연자원이 고갈 되고 지구온난화 현상으로 인해 많은 환경적 사회적 경제적 문제가 발생 하고 있습니다. 이러한 배경하에 2008년 우리 정부가 발표한 저탄소 녹색성장정책은 지속가능한 성장을 위해 녹색경제를 이끌어내는 새로운 국가발전 패러다임입니다. 이러한 정책은 환경에 대한 부정적인 영향을 최소화하면서 경제발전에 기여하는, 즉 경제와 환경을 서로 조화시킬 수 있는 정책으로서 산업의 녹색화, 에너지 효율 제고, 녹색기술 개발 등의 방법으로 온실가스 배출 감축을 추구하고 있습니다. 녹색성장의 실현을 위하여 녹색성장위원회가 설립되었으며, 녹색성장 5개 년계획이 수립되었습니다. 법적으로는 녹색성장의 기본방향을 정한 저탄소 녹색성장 기본법이 2010년 4월부터 시행되고 있으며, 구체적인 정책을 담은 법령들이 채택되고 있습니다. 또한 대외적으로 우리나라는 기후변화 협상, WTO와 APEC에서 무역과 환경에 대한 다자논의에 참여하고 있습니다. 아울러 우리나라는 글로벌녹색성장연구소(GGGI)와 녹색기후기금(GCF) 같은 국제기구의 유치국가로 선정되었습니다. 이 같은 사실은 기후변화 완화에 대한 우리나라의 기여와 노력이 국제적으로 인정받은 것으로 해석될 수 있는 한편, 지구온난화에 대한 세계 공동체의 대응책에 있어 우리나라에 더욱 많은 책임감이 주어진 것이라 할 수 있겠습니다. 녹색성장정책 수행 시 각종 국내조치는 국제무역에 영향을 미칠 수 있습니다. 예를 들어 고탄소 수입제품에 저탄소 국산제품보다 높은 세금이 부과 되거나, 환경친화적 상품을 생산하는 국내업체들에 보조금이 제공되거나, 엄격한 온실가스 배출 기준이 도입되면, 외국 생산자나 수출업체들이 불이익을 당하고 국제교역이 왜곡될 수 있습니다. 이렇게 될 경우 이들 조치가 다자무 역을 규율하는 WTO 규범을 준수하는가에 대한 문제가 제기될 수 있습니다. 이러한 관점에서 본 연구는 우리나라의 저탄소 녹색성장정책 중 무역 관련 주요 분야와 WTO 규범 간의 조화 가능성, 그리고 녹색성장을 위한 다자 무역체제와 기후변화체제 간의 조화 가능성을 각각 검토하고 이에 따른 정책 시사점을 제시하였습니다. In his address marking the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Korea in 2008, President Lee Myung-bak declared ‘Low Carbon Green Growth’ as the country’s new vision to lead the country’s development for the next decades. Since then Korea has taken active measures to combat climate change on both legislative and executive front. A number of ‘green’ measures have an impact on trade and may thus be subject to global trade rules administered by the World Trade Organization (WTO). This study examines Korea’s green measures - relevant laws, regulations, and programs - from the perspective of WTO law, and explores possible ways of harmonization of the green growth policy with multilateral trade disciplines. The concept of harmonization within the meaning of this study has both internal and external aspects. More specifically, the authors first considered the harmonization at an internal level and suggested that Korea ensure WTO-consistency of its domestic green measures. For this purpose, they examined green measures in three domestic policy areas, such as market opening, industrial subsidies, and technical barriers to trade. Then, they proceeded to see how the global climate regime and the multilateral trade regime could be harmonized on an international plane, and what Korea’s contribution to this process should be. With respect to the market opening policy, the authors considered, inter alia, GATT-based implications of a carbon tax, import restrictions arising from the emissions trading system and the Bonus-Malus system for car purchasers - the measures that are not currently applied in Korea, but are used by other countries. As for the industrial support policy, Korea’s green subsidies have not yet been complained of in WTO disputes, but were targeted by US countervailing measures - something that should be paid attention to by Korean policy-makers when designing green incentive schemes for domestic producers. As far as technical regulations and standards are concerned, a few WTO members have raised specific trade concerns in the TBT Committee in relation to some Korean green measures. With respect to the external harmonization issue, the authors focused on two approaches, such as ‘greening’ the WTO and making the global climate regime more ‘WTO-friendly’. In order for the WTO to become more ‘environment-friendly’, the current Doha negotiations on trade and environment should be successfully completed. The authors here proposed that Korea put forward the idea of plurilateral negotiations in the WTO based on APEC’s initiatives on trade and environment. Korea could also initiate discussion among WTO members aimed at rendering climate change subsidies non-actionable under current WTO subsidy disciplines. Moreover, the authors suggested that the Korean government establish environmental impact assessments for its trade treaties so as to ensure that, inter alia, WTO agreements entered into by Korea reflect environmental concerns. In this way, Korea could have an indirect influence on the greening of the WTO. Finally, with a view to making the global climate regime more WTO-friendly, Korea should support a proposal of several countries to discuss within the UNFCCC framework the impact of climate-related response measures on trade, but oppose the idea of introducing a total ban on unilateral response measures. Such a ban would come into conflict with the GATT general exception clause (Article XX) - a WTO provision that can be invoked to justify environment protection measures.","自第二次世界大战以来持续增长的国际贸易，虽对经济发展产生了积极影响，占全球GDP的25%，但同时也带来了环境上的负面影响——约21.5%的全球二氧化碳排放源自国际贸易。过去几十年间，全球范围内的工业化等人为活动导致自然资源枯竭，地球变暖现象引发诸多环境、社会及经济问题。在此背景下，我国政府2008年提出的""低碳绿色增长""政策，成为引领绿色经济、实现可持续发展的国家发展新范式。该政策通过产业绿色转型、提升能效、开发绿色技术等手段，在最小化环境负面影响的同时促进经济发展，力求实现经济与环境的和谐共生。. . 为落实绿色增长，我国成立了绿色增长委员会并制定五年规划。2010年4月起实施的《低碳绿色增长基本法》确立了政策框架，配套法规相继出台。国际层面，韩国积极参与气候变化谈判，在WTO与APEC推动贸易与环境的多边讨论，更成为全球绿色增长研究所（GGGI）和绿色气候基金（GCF）等国际机构的东道国。这些成就既彰显了国际社会对我国应对气候变化贡献的认可，也赋予我们更大的全球责任。. . 绿色增长政策的国内措施可能影响国际贸易。例如对高碳进口产品征收更高关税、补贴环保企业、实施严格排放标准等做法，可能造成外国生产商的贸易劣势，引发是否符合WTO规则的争议。本研究据此探讨了韩国绿色政策与WTO规则的兼容性，以及多边贸易体系与气候变化机制的协调路径。. . 2008年国庆60周年讲话中，李明博总统将""低碳绿色增长""确立为国家未来发展的核心战略。此后韩国通过立法与行政措施积极应对气候变化，部分绿色政策涉及贸易领域，需符合WTO规则。本研究从WTO法视角审视韩国绿色措施（法律、法规及计划），探索其与多边贸易规则的协调方案。. . 研究的""协调""概念包含内外双重维度：对内确保国内绿色措施符合WTO规则，重点考察市场开放、产业补贴和技术性贸易壁垒三大领域；对外推动全球气候机制与多边贸易体系的协同，明确韩国的贡献方向。市场开放政策方面，作者分析了碳关税、排放交易制度及汽车购置奖惩体系可能引发的GATT合规问题；产业支持政策方面，指出韩国绿色补贴虽未引发WTO诉讼，但已遭美国反制措施，需在设计激励方案时警惕；技术法规领域，部分措施已在WTO技术性贸易壁垒委员会引发成员质疑。. . 关于外部协调，研究提出""WTO绿化""和""气候机制WTO友好化""两种路径：建议韩国基于APEC倡议在WTO推动诸边环境谈判，发起气候变化补贴非诉性讨论，建立贸易条约环境影响评估机制；同时主张韩国在UNFCCC框架内支持讨论气候措施贸易影响，但反对全面禁止单边气候措施——此类禁令可能与GATT第20条环保例外条款冲突。","Green Growth Policy, Multilateral Trade Rules, Low Carbon Green Growth, Environment protection",2013-09-13

We use two complementary approaches, one focusing on the size of total trade flows and one focusing on bilateral trade patterns (gravity equation). We also control for two other domestic policy variables: trade policy and domestic infrastructure. We find that the quality of institutions has a positive and significant impact on a country's level of openness. Domestic tariffs have no statistically significant impact alone, but do affect total trade flows when combined with good institutions. Domestic institutions also have a positive and significant impact on bilateral trade flows, but the parameter of our institution variables is reduced by almost a half and may turn insignificant when the quality of domestic infrastructure is included in the regression.",本文分析了国内制度对贸易流量的影响程度。我们采用两种互补的研究方法：一种聚焦于贸易总流量规模，另一种关注双边贸易模式（引力方程模型）。同时，我们控制了另外两项国内政策变量——贸易政策与国内基础设施。研究发现：制度质量对国家开放水平具有显著正向影响。国内关税单独作用时未呈现统计显著性，但与优质制度结合时会对贸易总流量产生影响。国内制度对双边贸易流量同样存在显著正向作用，但当回归模型中加入国内基础设施质量变量后，制度变量的参数值会下降近半且可能失去统计显著性。,"Openness, bilateral trade flows, gravity model, institutional quality",2004-07-07

The task has become vastly more complicated in recent decades. Those complications stem primarily from an expanding view of what is tradeable and, therefore, what topics fall within the scope of trade policy. At the same time that the issue base of the trading system has expanded, so has the range of instruments that countries can negotiate; bilateral and regional options are proliferating. The net result is that the issues in trade policy are now analytically more challenging, policymaking requires that trade ministries engage in active communication with a much wider range of public entities and private interests and they must be prepared to engage in multiple and concurrent negotiations in a variety of forums. This paper analyses these problems, including empirical data on the form and extent of countries' representation in Geneva and a case study on how the United States deals with these challenges.

trade policy,"CompetitionPolicy,Tradeand the Global Economy: Existing WTO Elements, Commitments in RegionalTradeAgreements, Current Challenges and Issues for Reflection",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3321116,Robert D. Anderson,"Competition policy, today, is an essential element of the legal and institutional framework for the global economy. Whereas decades ago, anti-competitive practices tended to be viewed mainly as a domestic phenomenon, most facets of competition law enforcement now have an important international dimension. Examples include: the investigation and prosecution of price fixing and market sharing arrangements that often spill across national borders and, in important instances, encircle the globe; multiple recent, prominent cases of abuses of a dominant position in high-tech network industries; important current cases involving transnational energy markets; and major corporate mergers that often need to be simultaneously reviewed by multiple jurisdictions. Beyond competition law enforcement per se, increasingly, major issues of competition policy  (e.g., the impact on competition of the structure and scope of intellectual property rights or the role of state-owned enterprises) implicate the interests of multiple jurisdictions.To date, efforts to establish a general agreement on competition policy in the framework of the international trading system have been unsuccessful. Nonetheless, provisions relating to competition policy are incorporated in the WTO General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT); the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS); the Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement); the Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs Agreement); and other WTO instruments. Effective national competition policies are also essential to realizing the benefits derivable from participation in the (plurilateral) WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA). The importance of competition policy for world trade is also manifested by the increasing incorporation of undertakings on competition policy in the Protocols of Accessions that apply to new WTO Members, and in the work of the WTO Trade Policy Review Body, which systematically references developments regarding national competition policies in developed and developing jurisdictions.Beyond this, as set out in this paper and further manifesting the significance of competition policy for international trade, detailed chapters on competition policy have been incorporated in numerous bilateral and regional trade agreements (RTAs) linking developed and developing economies around the globe.The WTO Working Group on the Interaction between Trade and Competition Policy, which was active from 1997 through 2003 and which considered the case for a more general agreement on competition policy in the WTO, has been inactive since 2004. It is, nonetheless, available as a potential vehicle for stocktaking of developments and reflection on relevant issues if ever WTO Members find this useful and timely. A salient related consideration is that, whereas in 1997, when discussion commenced in the WTO Working Group, only around 50 economies in the world had national competition legislation, currently, about 135 WTO Members have such laws. These include all of the BRICS economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and a large number of other developing WTO Members.Concurrent with the foregoing developments, increasing attention is being given, in international policy circles, to particular issues of competition law enforcement and competition policy with significance for the global economy. These include:• The international dimension of competition law cases: the resulting positive spillovers for economic welfare and potential for conflicts of jurisdiction;• The broadening application of competition policy vis-à-vis intellectual property rights in the global economy;• Important issues concerning the potential for monopolization and the maintenance of competition in digital markets;• Issues concerning state-owned enterprises, the role of industrial policy and the maintenance of competitive neutrality in emerging economies; and• A mounting concern, on the part of global businesses, to ensure non-discrimination, transparency and procedural fairness in competition law enforcement worldwide.This paper reviews and reflects upon these and related developments. It proceeds from the premises that important synergies exist between trade and competition policy and that it is reasonable to acknowledge this and inquire whether additional steps are desirable to ensure the full realization of the relevant synergies. The paper is intended to serve as a resource for reflection on related issues, if and/or when WTO Members decide to undertake such an exercise. Even so, it is recognized that the issues are complex, and that simplistic or overly ambitious or prescriptive solutions will not be helpful. In this light, the closing portions of the paper reflect upon the importance of relevant international learning processes; the actual and potential contributions of the WTO in this regard; and prospects for the future.","当今，竞争政策已成为全球经济法律与制度框架的核心要素。数十年前，反竞争行为主要被视为国内现象，而如今竞争法执行的多数领域都具有显著的国际性特征。典型案例包括：常跨越国界甚至波及全球的价格操纵与市场分割协议调查；近年来高科技网络产业频发的滥用市场支配地位案件；涉及跨国能源市场的重大争议；以及常需多国监管机构同步审查的大型企业并购。除竞争执法本身外，竞争政策重大议题（如知识产权结构与范围对竞争的影响、国有企业角色等）也日益牵涉多国利益。. . 尽管在国际贸易体系框架内达成全面竞争政策协定的努力尚未成功，但WTO《关税与贸易总协定》（GATT）、《服务贸易总协定》（GATS）、《与贸易有关的知识产权协定》（TRIPS）、《与贸易有关的投资措施协定》（TRIMs）等文件均已纳入竞争政策条款。有效的国内竞争政策对实现《政府采购协定》（GPA）的潜在效益同样至关重要。WTO加入议定书中日益增多的竞争政策承诺，以及贸易政策审议机构对发达国家与发展中国家竞争政策发展的系统性关注，均凸显竞争政策对国际贸易的重要性。. . 此外，本文指出全球南北国家签署的双边与区域贸易协定（RTAs）普遍设有竞争政策专章，进一步印证其国际贸易意义。WTO贸易与竞争政策互动工作组（1997-2003年运作）曾探讨制定WTO框架下综合性竞争协定的可行性，虽自2004年起暂停活动，仍可作为未来成员国有需求时评估进展与研讨议题的平台。值得注意的是，1997年工作组启动时全球仅约50个经济体拥有竞争法，而今已有135个WTO成员制定相关法律，涵盖所有金砖国家（巴西、俄罗斯、印度、中国、南非）及众多其他发展中成员。. . 国际政策界正日益关注对全球经济具有特殊意义的竞争执法与政策议题，包括：竞争案件的国际性特征及其带来的经济福利外溢效应与管辖权冲突风险；竞争政策在全球经济中应对知识产权问题的扩展应用；数字市场垄断化与竞争维护的关键议题；新兴经济体中国有企业、产业政策与竞争中性原则的平衡；以及全球企业界对确保各国竞争执法非歧视性、透明度与程序公正的迫切诉求。. . 本文基于""贸易政策与竞争政策存在重要协同效应""的前提，系统梳理上述发展动态，旨在为WTO成员国未来可能的政策探讨提供参考。同时强调议题复杂性，反对简单化或过度理想化的解决方案。文末着重探讨国际经验交流的重要性、WTO的实际与潜在贡献，以及未来发展前景。","Competition Policy, Anti-Competitive Practices, International Trade Policy, WTO Agreements, Regional Trade Agreements, State-Owned Enterprises, Competitive Neutrality, Digital Economy",2019-02-07
trade policy,TradeEffects of Customs Reform: Evidence from Albania,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2576526,Ana M. Fernandes,"Despite enormous academic interest in international trade costs and keen policy interest in efforts to mitigate them, so far there is very little hard evidence on the impacts of trade facilitation efforts. This paper exploits a dramatic reduction in the rate of physical inspections by Albanian customs to estimate the effects of fewer inspection-related delays on the level and composition of imports. In this setting, the paper finds evidence that the expected median number of days spent in Albanian customs falls by 7 percent when the probability that a shipment is inspected falls from 50 percent or more to under 50 percent. In turn, this reduction in time produces a 7 percent increase in import value. The paper finds evidence that the reforms favored imports from preferential trading partners, especially the European Union. There are also reform-induced changes in the composition of trade, including increases in average quantities and unit prices, the number of shipments, and the number of importing firms per product-country pair and the number of countries per firm-product pair. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the estimate of 7 percent import growth along an intensive margin is roughly consistent with a 0.36 percentage point reduction in average tariff equivalent trade costs. Applying this figure to the value of Albania's non-oil imports produces a reform-induced trade cost savings estimate of approximately US$12 million in 2012.",尽管学术界对国际贸易成本抱有浓厚兴趣，政策制定者也积极寻求降低贸易成本的途径，但迄今为止关于贸易便利化措施实际影响的实证证据仍极为有限。本文利用阿尔巴尼亚海关大幅降低实物查验率的契机，评估了减少查验延误对进口规模及结构的影响。研究发现，当货物被查验概率从50%以上降至50%以下时，货物在阿尔巴尼亚海关停留的中位时间预期缩短7%，进而带动进口总值增长7%。证据表明，改革尤其惠及来自欧盟等优惠贸易伙伴的进口。改革还引发了贸易结构的系列变化：平均交易量与单价提升、货运批次增加、每个产品-国家组合对应的进口商数量增多、每个企业-产品组合涉及的国家数量上升。粗略估算显示，集约边际上7%的进口增长约相当于平均关税等值贸易成本降低0.36个百分点。将此数值代入阿尔巴尼亚非石油进口规模测算，2012年改革带来的贸易成本节约约为1200万美元。,"International Trade and Trade Rules, Trade Facilitation, Rules of Origin, Trade Policy, Trade and Multilateral Issues, Trade and Services",2016-04-20

Martin,"This paper investigates the impact of food trade policies on domestic and international price volatility, focusing on rice and wheat markets. It posits that policymakers aim to minimize the political costs associated with changing domestic prices and deviating from political-economy equilibria. The study uses price data, adjusted to reflect trade costs, to estimate an Error Correction Model that identifies key policy response parameters. The findings suggest that systematic, short-run protection changes designed to insulate against changes in world prices reduce shocks to domestic prices but exacerbate world price volatility. However, idiosyncratic, national shocks to protection rates-such as those due to national weather shocks-increase domestic price volatility relative to the amplified volatility of world prices. Our findings challenge the conventional view of price insulation as a zero-sum game, suggesting it is a negative-sum game that increases domestic price volatility for most countries, creating opportunities for policy reforms to lower costs and reduce price volatility.",本文研究了粮食贸易政策对国内外价格波动的影响，重点关注大米和小麦市场。研究提出，政策制定者的目标在于最小化由国内价格变动及偏离政治经济均衡所带来的政治成本。通过采用经贸易成本调整后的价格数据，本研究建立误差修正模型以识别关键政策响应参数。研究发现，旨在隔离国际价格波动的系统性短期保护措施变动虽能缓解国内价格冲击，却会加剧国际市场价格波动。然而，保护率的特异性国家冲击（如由国内气候异常引发的变动）会相对于被放大的国际价格波动，进一步增加国内价格波动性。这些发现挑战了将价格隔离视为零和博弈的传统观点，揭示其实际是负和博弈——对多数国家而言会加剧国内价格波动，从而为降低成本和减少价格波动的政策改革创造了契机。,"trade policy, food prices, behavioral economics, econometric models, food price volatility.

Most of these latter interventions are based on the new mantra of ""aid-for-trade"" rather than on hard evidence on what works and what does not. On the one hand, rigorous impact-evaluation is needed to justify these interventions and to improve their design. On the other hand, rigorous evaluation is feasible because unlike traditional trade policy, these interventions tend to be targeted and so it is possible to construct treatment and control groups. When interventions are not targeted, such as in the case of customs reforms, some techniques, such as randomized control trials, may not be feasible but meaningful evaluation may still be possible. Theis paper discusses examples of impact evaluations using a range of methods (experimental and non-experimental), highlighting the particular issues and caveats arising in a trade context, and the valuable lessons that are already being learned. The authors argue that systematically building impact evaluation into trade projects could lead to better policy design and a more credible case for ""aid-for-trade.""","近年来，贸易政策的重点已从全面降低关税和贸易限制转向针对性干预措施以促进贸易和推动出口。这些干预措施大多基于""贸易援助""的新理念，而非关于哪些措施有效、哪些无效的确凿证据。一方面，需要严格的影响评估来证明这些干预措施的合理性并改进其设计。另一方面，严格评估是可行的，因为与传统贸易政策不同，这些干预措施通常具有针对性，因此可以构建实验组和对照组。当干预措施不具备针对性时（如海关改革），随机对照试验等方法可能不可行，但仍可能进行有意义的评估。本文讨论了采用多种方法（实验性和非实验性）进行影响评估的案例，重点探讨了贸易背景下出现的特殊问题和注意事项，以及目前已获得的宝贵经验。作者认为，将影响评估系统性地纳入贸易项目，可优化政策设计，并为""贸易援助""提供更可信的依据。","Economic Theory & Research, Trade Policy, Transport Economics Policy & Planning, Poverty Monitoring & Analysis, Free Trade",2016-04-20
trade policy,Tradeand Investment UnderPolicyUncertainty: Theory and Firm Evidence,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2013769,Kyle Handley,"We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that policy uncertainty can significantly affect firm level investment and entry decisions in the context of international trade. When market entry costs are sunk, policy uncertainty can create a real option value of waiting to enter foreign markets until conditions improve or uncertainty is resolved. Using a dynamic, heterogeneous firms model we show that: (i) investment and entry into export markets is reduced when trade policy is uncertain, and (ii) preferential trade agreements (PTAs) are valuable to exporters even if applied trade barriers are currently low or zero. We derive a structural equation that predicts how firm entry responds to changes in applied tariffs and a theory-based measure of policy uncertainty.  Our novel approach using observable trade policies allows us to estimate the impact of policy uncertainty and quantify its aggregate implications.  We apply this method to Portugal's accession to the European Community in 1986 using new firm-level trade data. We find that (i) the trade policy reform accounted for a large fraction of the observed Portuguese exporting firms' entry and sales upon accession (ii) the accession removed uncertainty about future preferences and (iii) this uncertainty channel accounted for a large fraction of the predicted growth. These results have broader implications for other PTAs and our approach can be applied to analyze other sources of policy uncertainty.",我们提供的理论和实证证据表明，在国际贸易背景下，政策不确定性会显著影响企业层面的投资与市场进入决策。当市场进入成本具有沉没性时，政策不确定性会产生等待进入外国市场的实物期权价值——企业会延迟进入直至市场条件改善或不确定性消除。通过构建动态异质性企业模型，我们发现：（1）当贸易政策存在不确定性时，企业减少对出口市场的投资与进入；（2）即便现行贸易壁垒处于低位或为零，优惠贸易协定（PTAs）对出口商仍具有重要价值。我们推导出一个预测企业进入如何响应实施关税变化的结构方程，以及一个基于理论的政策不确定性测度指标。这种利用可观测贸易政策的新方法，使我们能量化政策不确定性的影响及其宏观效应。我们将此方法应用于1986年葡萄牙加入欧洲共同体的事件，结合新的企业层面贸易数据发现：（1）贸易政策改革解释了葡萄牙出口企业在入盟时大部分新增进入与销售额；（2）入盟消除了未来优惠待遇的不确定性；（3）该不确定性渠道对预测增长贡献显著。这些结论对其他优惠贸易协定具有普适意义，我们的方法也可用于分析其他政策不确定性来源。,"Investment, Policy, Trade, Uncertainty",2012-03-01

Since then, notwithstanding with its great ambition, the DDA has failed to draw visible results for more than 17 years, and hence confidence in the WTO-centered multilateral trading system has been declining accordingly. Nevertheless, there are some of the accomplishments of the WTO. The liberalization of the commodity markets has expanded and deepened through the conclusions of plurilateral negotiations under the WTO such as the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) and the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), and rules in service and intellectual property rights have been set-out and established. As a result of these achievements, the volume of global commodity trade has increased by more than three times, and the market share of developing countries has also increased from 28% in 1995 to 43% in 2017. The expansion of the number of member states is another achievement of the WTO. Although such expansion may have increased the difficulties and complexity of decision making in the WTO, it is clear that the expansion of new business opportunities by successfully incorporating developing countries into the global economy and applying unified WTO rules and standards is an achievement of the WTO. Along with the strengthening of the dispute settlement system, the Agreement on Trade Facilitation (TFA) and its implementation are the greatest achievements of the WTO system. The Trade Facilitation Agreement is the first multilateral trade agreement concluded after the establishment of the WTO and the launch of the DDA negotiations, while the Information Technology Agreement and the Government Procurement Agreement are plurilateral agreements. Economically, it is expected of the increase in exports by more than $ 1 trillion, the creation of 20 million export-related jobs, and the increase in the world's GDP by about $ 960 billion due to the reduction of trade costs and the improvement of trade environment.The limitations and problems of the WTO system are as clear as these achievements. In particular, governance issues that have long been pointed out are such typical examples. Decisions in the WTO system are in fact made by consensus, and enlarging the number of Member States has become a decisive factor in hindering efficient decision-making in the WTO. Although The ‘Single Undertaking’ principle of concluding the agreement contributed to maintaining the consistency and stability of the multilateral trade system, it caused the problem of the rigidity of the WTO system at the same time. The dispute settlement procedure is also increasingly problematic. Recently, the dispute settlement implementation process is increasingly followed by the retaliation process. In such processes, the situation in which the complainant must observe the implementation failure of the defendant until the retaliation is approved is undermining the fairness of the WTO system. Not only that, the lack of safeguard measures in service trade and the limitations and problems of special and differential treatment for developing countries have been pointed out as major challenges related to the current WTO system. In addition to the challenges of the WTO system itself, the fact that the WTO does not adequately respond to the rapidly changing global trade environment is also a major problem of the current WTO system. The reason why the FTAs around the world in the 2000’s have rapidly expanded is the WTO multilateral system has failed to respond effectively to the new trading environment. Since the early 2000s, the Global Production Networks have rapidly spread out and the 'made in world' has become common due to such international division of production, and hence the set-out of new trading rules and further tariff concessions in accordance with such development has long been awaited. However, the progress of DDA has fallen far short of expectation due to the confrontation between developed and developing countries. As the global economic slowdown has been prolonged since the global financial crisis in 2008, countries around the world have strengthened their protectionist policies for their industries and jobs. Notwithstanding, the WTO failed to issue a proper prescription for them. WTO members have constantly bashed protectionism and stated the importance of strengthening multilateral trade system whenever there is opportunity, but this is only an empty declaration; non-tariff measures have steadily increased since the financial crisis and have not returned to pre-2008 levels.","世界贸易组织（WTO）作为关贸总协定体系的继承者于1995年成立，并于2001年雄心勃勃地启动了首轮多边贸易谈判——多哈发展议程（DDA）。尽管怀抱宏大愿景，但历经17年多谈判仍未取得显著成果，WTO为核心的多边贸易体系公信力随之持续下滑。不过WTO仍取得若干成就：通过《信息技术协定》《政府采购协定》等诸边谈判推动货物市场自由化向纵深发展，建立服务贸易与知识产权规则体系。全球货物贸易量由此增长逾三倍，发展中国家市场份额从1995年的28%提升至2017年的43%。成员规模扩大是另一项成就——虽然增加了决策复杂度，但将发展中国家成功纳入全球经济体系并适用统一规则，由此拓展的新商业机遇无疑是WTO的功绩。争端解决机制的强化与《贸易便利化协定》（TFA）的实施堪称WTO体系最显著成就。该协定是WTO成立暨DDA启动后达成的首份多边贸易协定（前述两项为诸边协定），预计将通过降低贸易成本、改善贸易环境带动出口增长超1万亿美元，创造2000万个出口相关岗位，推动全球GDP增长约9600亿美元。. .

trade policy,The Heterogeneous Effects ofTradePolicyUncertainty: How Much DoTradeCommitments BoostTrade?,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3239706,Alberto Osnago,"This paper studies the effects of trade policy uncertainty on the extensive and intensive margins of trade for a sample of 65 exporters at the Harmonized System six-digit level. The paper measures trade policy uncertainty as the gap between binding tariff commitments under trade agreements (multilateral and regional agreements) and applied tariffs -- what is also known as tariffs' water. The results show that trade policy uncertainty is an important barrier to exports and its effects are heterogeneous. On average and at the current level of tariff commitments, the paper estimates that the elimination of water, without any change of the applied tariff, would increase the probability of exporting by 6 percent and trade volumes by 1.3 percent. The negative impact of trade policy uncertainty on export participation is higher for countries with low-quality institutions and in the presence of global value chains. For a sample of new acceding countries, the analysis finds that removing water would boost the probability of trading by 50 percent and exports by 16 percent. The paper also estimates that the current system of commitments boosts trade by between 10 and 30 percent, compared with a world where at any moment tariffs could be raised to an arbitrarily high level.","本文研究了贸易政策不确定性对65个出口国在《商品名称及编码协调制度》六位码层面贸易广延边际与集约边际的影响。研究将贸易政策不确定性量化为贸易协定（多边与区域协定）下的约束关税承诺与实际适用关税之间的差额——即所谓""关税水分""。结果表明，贸易政策不确定性是出口的重要障碍，其影响具有异质性。根据当前关税承诺水平估算，在保持适用关税不变的情况下，完全消除关税水分将使出口概率平均提高6%，贸易量增长1.3%。对于制度质量较低的国家及存在全球价值链的情况，贸易政策不确定性对出口参与的负面影响更为显著。针对新加入国家的样本分析显示，消除关税水分可使贸易概率提升50%，出口增长16%。研究还估算，与一个关税可能被任意提高至极高水平的世界相比，现行承诺体系使贸易量增长了10%至30%。",,2018-08-28

The analysis proceeds in three steps. First, longitudinal data on workers are used to estimate time-varying individual income risk parameters in various manufacturing sectors. The estimated income risk parameters and data on trade barriers are then used to analyze the relationship between trade policy and income risk. Finally, a simple dynamic general equilibrium model with incomplete markets is used assess the corresponding welfare costs. In the implementation of this methodology using Mexican data, we find that trade policy changes have a significant short run effect on income risk.

Ikenson,"An emerging narrative in 2012 is that a proliferation of protectionist, treaty-violating, or otherwise illiberal Chinese policies is to blame for worsening U.S.-China relations. China trade experts from across the ideological and political spectra have lent credibility to that story. Business groups that once counseled against U.S. government actions that might be perceived by the Chinese as provocative have changed their tunes. The term “trade war” is no longer taboo. The media have portrayed the United States as a victim of underhanded Chinese practices, including currency manipulation, dumping, subsidization, intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, discriminatory “indigenous innovation” policies, export restrictions, industrial espionage, and other ad hoc impediments to U.S. investment and exports. Indeed, it is beyond doubt that certain Chinese policies have been provocative, discriminatory, protectionist, and, in some cases, violative of the agreed rules of international trade. But there is more to the story than that. U.S. policies, politics, and attitudes have contributed to rising tensions, as have rabble-rousing politicians and a confrontation-thirsty media. If the public’s passions are going to be inflamed with talk of a trade war, prudence demands that the war’s nature be properly characterized and its causes identified and accurately depicted. Those agitating for tough policy actions should put down their battle bugles and consider that trade wars are never won. Instead, such wars claim victims indiscriminately and leave significant damage in their wake. Even if one concludes that China’s list of offenses is collectively more egregious than that of the United States, the most sensible course of action — for the American public (if not campaigning politicians) — is one that avoids mutually destructive actions and finds measures to reduce frictions with China.","2012年兴起的一种说法认为，美中关系恶化应归咎于中国保护主义政策泛滥、违反条约或其他非自由主义政策。来自不同意识形态和政治派别的中国贸易专家都为这一说法提供了依据。曾经建议美国政府避免采取可能被中国视为挑衅行为的商业团体，如今已转变态度。""贸易战""一词不再禁忌。媒体将美国描绘成中国不正当行为的受害者，包括操纵汇率、倾销、补贴、窃取知识产权、强制技术转让、歧视性的""自主创新""政策、出口限制、工业间谍活动，以及其他对美国投资和出口的临时性阻碍。确实，某些中国政策具有挑衅性、歧视性、保护主义色彩，甚至在某些情况下违反公认的国际贸易规则，这一点毋庸置疑。但事情并非如此简单。美国的政策、政治氛围和公众态度，以及煽动民粹的政客和渴望对抗的媒体，都加剧了紧张局势。如果要通过贸易战言论煽动公众情绪，审慎的做法是准确界定这场战争的性质，查明并如实描述其根源。那些鼓吹强硬政策的人应当放下战斗号角，须知贸易战从来没有赢家。这种战争只会无差别地造成伤害，留下严重创伤。即便认定中国的过错总体上比美国更严重，对美国公众（如果不是对竞选政客而言）最明智的做法仍是避免采取两败俱伤的行动，寻求减少与中国摩擦的措施。","United States trade policy, American trade with China, US trade deficit with China, economic trade barriers, trade war with China, Chinese exports, protectionist trade laws",2013-03-02
trade policy,Increasing the Impact ofTradeExpansion on Growth: Lessons fromTradeReforms for the Design of Aid forTrade,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1635733,Jean-Jacques Hallaert,"The working paper “Binding Constraints to Trade Expansion: Aid for Trade Objectives and Diagnostics Tools” [OECD Trade Policy Working Paper No. 94] showed that the most common objectives of Aid for Trade have the potential to boost economic growth. However, this growth potential may not always be realized. While most trade reforms had a positive impact, some trade reforms proved unsustainable and some trade reforms did not have a meaningful impact on growth. This working paper discusses the various reasons for these outcomes in order to draw the lessons for the design of aid-for-trade projects and programmes and increase their effectiveness. It argues that the scope of activity of aid-for-trade is broad enough to support the compatible that will make the reform sustainable and the complementary policies that will increase its growth impact. Experience shows that an appropriate macroeconomic environment is essential to make a trade reform sustainable. In an unstable macroeconomic environment, aid for trade can support compatible policies that reinforce the stabilization process. In a stable macroeconomic environment, aid for trade can help preventing trade reform from resulting in macro-economic tensions and can foster a rapid export response. The working paper also argues that many complementary policies fall under the scope of activity of aid for trade and shows that aid-for-trade projects and programmes already support some of the key complementary policies. Supporting compatible and complementary policies is about policy coherence and adequate sequencing. In order to reach its objective, Aid for Trade should not only focus on helping developing countries to turn trade opportunities into trade but also tackle the binding constraints that choke the impact of trade on economic growth. Aid for trade has the means to do so but this requires proper sequencing and policy coherence. As much as possible, proper sequencing and policy coherence should be reflected in the design of aid-for-trade projects and programmes. This cannot be achieved without adequate donor coordination and alignment on country priorities.",工作文件《贸易扩展的制约因素：贸易援助目标与诊断工具》[OECD贸易政策工作文件第94号]指出，贸易援助最常见的目标具有促进经济增长的潜力。但这种增长潜力未必总能实现。尽管多数贸易改革产生了积极影响，但部分改革被证明不可持续，另一些改革则未能对增长产生实质影响。本工作文件通过分析这些结果的不同成因，为贸易援助项目与方案的设计提供经验借鉴，从而提升其实施效果。研究认为，贸易援助的活动范围足够广泛，既能支持确保改革可持续的兼容性政策，也能实施增强增长效应的配套政策。经验表明，适宜的宏观经济环境是贸易改革可持续的关键。在宏观经济不稳定的情况下，贸易援助可支持强化稳定进程的兼容政策；在宏观经济稳定的环境中，贸易援助既能防止贸易改革引发宏观经济失衡，又能促进出口快速响应。文件同时指出，诸多配套政策均属于贸易援助的活动范畴，现有贸易援助项目已支持部分关键配套政策。支持兼容性与配套政策的核心在于政策协调与合理排序。为实现目标，贸易援助不仅应帮助发展中国家将贸易机遇转化为贸易现实，更须解决制约贸易对经济增长促进作用的瓶颈因素。贸易援助具备相应实施手段，但需要合理的政策排序与协调。这种排序与协调应尽可能体现在贸易援助项目设计中，而这离不开捐助方基于受援国优先事项的充分协调与统一行动。,"Aid for Trade, Trade Expansion, Supply-Side Constraints, Trade and Growth, Trade Reforms, Complementary Policies, Sequencing of Reforms, Aid effectiveness",2010-07-08

We systematically document the coverage of NTPOs in EU trade agreements and in its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). We then examine the extent to which trade agreements and GSP programs can be used to promote NTPOs. Preferential trade agreements are negotiated under multilateral rules, which require members to eliminate all tariffs reciprocally. As a result, once a trade agreement enters into force, the EU cannot easily restrict or extend access to its market so as to “punish bad behavior” or “reward good behavior” on NTPOs by its trading partners. By contrast, GSP preferences are granted on a unilateral basis, so they can be limited or extended,  depending on compliance with NTPOs. EU GSP programs can thus provide a carrot-and-stick mechanism to promote NTPOs in partner countries.","欧盟（EU）常以贸易伙伴遵守非贸易政策目标（NTPOs）作为给予其市场优惠准入的条件，这些目标包括人权、劳工及环境标准。我们系统梳理了欧盟贸易协定及普惠制（GSP）中非贸易政策目标的覆盖范围，进而探讨贸易协定与普惠制在推动非贸易政策目标方面的实际效力。根据多边规则，优惠贸易协定需通过成员间相互取消全部关税的谈判达成。因此协定生效后，欧盟难以通过限制或扩大市场准入来对贸易伙伴在非贸易政策目标上的""不良行为""实施惩罚或对""良好表现""予以奖励。相比之下，普惠制优惠属于单方面授予，可依据非贸易政策目标的履行情况灵活调整。欧盟普惠制由此形成""胡萝卜加大棒""机制，有效促进伙伴国落实非贸易政策目标。","Trade Agreements, GSP, Conditionality, Non-Trade Policy Objectives",2020-07-21

Fernandes,"This paper explores a period of substantial variation in trade policy across industries in Colombia (1977-1991) to examine whether increased exposure to foreign competition generates productivity gains for manufacturing plants. Using an estimation methodology that addresses the shortcomings of previous studies, we find a strong positive impact of tariff liberalization on plant productivity, even after controlling for plant and industry heterogeneity, real exchange rates, and cyclical effects. The impact of liberalization is stronger for larger plants and plants in less competitive industries. Our findings are not driven by the endogeneity of protection. Similar results are obtained when using effective rates of protection and import penetration ratios as measures of protection. Productivity gains under trade liberalization are linked to increases in intermediate inputs' imports, skill intensity, and machinery investments, and to output reallocations from less to more productive plants.",本文利用哥伦比亚各行业贸易政策存在显著差异的一段时期（1977-1991年），研究增加国际竞争是否会给制造业工厂带来生产率提升。通过采用能够解决以往研究缺陷的估计方法，我们发现即使控制了工厂与行业的异质性、实际汇率以及周期性影响，关税自由化仍对工厂生产率产生显著的积极影响。这种自由化效应在规模较大的工厂和竞争较弱行业中的工厂更为明显。我们的研究结果并非由保护政策的内生性所驱动。当使用有效保护率和进口渗透率作为保护程度的衡量指标时，同样得到了类似的结论。贸易自由化带来的生产率提升与中间产品进口增加、技能密集度提高、机械设备投资增长有关，同时也源于产出从低效工厂向高效工厂的重新配置。,"Simultaneity and Production Functions, Trade Policy, Productivity, Colombian Manufacturing, Endogeneity of Protection",2006-12-05

The formation of regional trade agreements has been, by far, the most popular form of reciprocal trade liberalization in the past 15 years. The discriminatory character of these agreements has raised three main concerns: that trade diversion would be rampant, because special interest groups would induce governments to form the most distortionary agreements; that broader external trade liberalization would stall or reverse; and that multilateralism could be undermined. Theoretically, all of these concerns are legitimate, although there are also several theoretical arguments that oppose them. Empirically, neither widespread trade diversion nor stalled external liberalization has materialized, while the undermining of multilateralism has not been properly tested. There are also several aspects of regionalism that have received too little attention from researchers, but which are central to understanding its causes and consequences.",本文回顾了关于区域主义的理论与实证研究文献。过去15年间，区域贸易协定的形成已成为互惠贸易自由化最普遍的形式。这些协定的歧视性特征引发了三大主要担忧：由于特殊利益集团会诱使政府缔结最具扭曲性的协定，贸易转移将泛滥成灾；更广泛的外部贸易自由化进程将停滞或逆转；多边主义可能遭到破坏。从理论上说，这些担忧都合乎情理，尽管也存在若干反对这些观点的理论论据。实证研究表明，既未出现大规模的贸易转移，也未发生外部自由化进程停滞的情况，而多边主义遭破坏的假设尚未得到充分验证。区域主义的若干关键方面——这些方面对理解其成因与影响至关重要——尚未得到研究者的足够重视。,"Free Trade, Trade Law, Trade Policy, Trade and Regional Integration, Economic Theory & Research",2016-04-20

Consultations with citizens and economic actors are therefore a fundamental part of making good trade policy. The term ""consultations"" covers efforts to build support for policies and practices that help the government develop effective policies. Public education; dissemination of information to interested groups; broad public involvement in the policy process; and narrow solicitation of information from economic actors are all essential for making democratic trade policy that will be both legitimate and effective. This book contributes to a growing literature on the national trade policy process. We undertook to explore several related questions. How has the trade policy process of key WTO Members changed? Has it become more or less democratic? Does an open and transparent process lead to a different or more legitimate trade policy? Does it alter the way a government balances interests, or perceives the public interest? Or is policy still dominated by whoever has the ear of government? Do money, or concentrated votes, talk? Does any of this make a difference for sustainable development? We decided to explore these issues in case studies of the national trade policy process in six WTO Members from five continents (Table 1). The developed countries are all relatively small members of the OECD: Canada, a federal state with a dominant trading partner in NAFTA; Norway, a member of the European Free Trade Association; and the Netherlands, a member of the European Union. The three developing countries-Brazil, India and South Africa-are all significant players in the Doha Round of WTO negotiations and middle-income countries that dominate trade in their own regions. All six countries are robust democracies that participate in significant regional agreements that constrain their trade policy in some way.

We also explore the extent to which the barriers faced by SSA exporters to the rest of the world are biased in favor of poor or rich households. To this end, we start with a simple agricultural household production model and propose an extension to include adjustments in labor income associated with changes in unskilled and skilled wages. We then build indicators that capture the differences in welfare changes across income levels associated with the elimination of SSA's own trade protection, as well as trade protection on SSA's export bundle by the rest of the world. Results suggest that SSA's own trade policy is biased in favor of poor households. In contrast, the trade policies of SSA's trading partners tend to be biased in favor of SSA's rich households, especially when ad-valorem equivalents of non tariff measures (NTMs) are taken into account.",本文旨在评估撒哈拉以南非洲（SSA）六国现行保护结构中对贫困人口的潜在偏向性（即是否实现了从富裕家庭向贫困家庭的收入再分配）。我们同时探究了SSA出口商面临的外部贸易壁垒对贫富家庭的差异化影响。为此，我们首先构建了一个简单的农户生产模型，进而扩展该模型以纳入非熟练工人与熟练工人工资变动带来的劳动收入调整。随后，我们建立了两类指标：一类衡量取消SSA本土贸易保护时，不同收入阶层福利变化的差异；另一类评估全球其他地区对SSA出口商品实施贸易保护时的福利分配差异。研究结果表明：SSA本土贸易政策具有亲贫倾向，而其贸易伙伴国的政策则普遍有利于SSA富裕家庭——当纳入非关税措施（NTMs）的从价等价物时，这一倾向尤为显著。,"Poverty, Sub-Saharan Africa, Trade policy, Wage elasticities",2011-11-01

trade policy,Mistaken Identities Make for BadTradePolicy,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4995840,Maurice Obstfeld,"Election season debates over trade policy have brought renewed attention to the United States' longstanding deficit in foreign trade. Critics from both the right and left sides of the political spectrum, including Donald Trump and his allies, hold the trade deficit responsible for a range of alleged ills, among them, slower US economic growth, fewer jobs, the decline in manufacturing, and a transfer of American wealth to foreign owners. Trump supporters' ideas to reduce US trade deficits, such as far-reaching taxes on international transactions or forced dollar devaluation, rest on particular theories of why the deficits have arisen and persisted. These theories often have little basis other than macroeconomic accounting identities—relationships that are always true, by definition, and that therefore are consistent with a range of economic outcomes. Two key macroeconomic identities, the national income and product identity and the balance-of-payments identity, have been widely abused as justifications for radical policies to balance US trade. The identities describe relationships that necessarily hold among macro variables, but without the further input of behavioral reasoning, they cannot yield valid predictions or constructive policy conclusions. Identity-based reasoning is especially dangerous because it disguises the collateral damage that superficial fixes may inflict. It is much better to identify and directly correct the distortions that cause excessive trade deficits to emerge and persist.",大选季围绕贸易政策的辩论再次引发对美国长期对外贸易逆差的关注。包括特朗普及其盟友在内的左右两派批评者将贸易逆差归咎于一系列所谓弊病：美国经济增长放缓、就业机会减少、制造业衰退以及国家财富向外国所有者转移。特朗普支持者提出的减少贸易逆差方案——如对国际交易全面课税或强制美元贬值——建立在特定理论基础上，这些理论试图解释逆差为何产生并持续存在。除宏观经济核算恒等式（这些定义上必然成立的关系式可兼容各种经济结果）外，此类理论往往缺乏依据。国民收入与产出恒等式、国际收支恒等式这两个关键宏观经济恒等式，常被滥用为平衡美国贸易的激进政策背书。这些恒等式虽能描述宏观变量间的必然关系，但若缺乏行为逻辑的进一步推导，就无法得出有效预测或建设性政策结论。基于恒等式的推理尤其危险，因其掩盖了表面解决方案可能造成的连带损害。更可取的做法是识别并直接纠正导致贸易逆差过度形成和持续的根本性扭曲。,"trade policy, trade deficit, United States, protectionism",2024-10-23

Fernandes,"Despite the importance of trade facilitation as an area of trade and development policy, there have been very few impact evaluations of specific trade facilitation reforms. This paper offers an evaluation of in-house clearance, a reform that allows qualified firms in Serbia to clear customs from within their own warehouse rather than at the customs office. The pooled synthetic control method applied here offers a novel solution to many of the empirical challenges that frustrate efforts to evaluate trade facilitation reforms. The method is used to estimate causal impacts on trade outcomes for 21 firms that adopted in-house clearance for import shipments. The program compressed the distribution of clearance times for adopting firms, but the estimated effects on median clearance times, inspection rates, and import value were not statistically significant. Tests for heterogeneous program impact do not indicate that the program affected adopting firms differently. Overall, the results suggest that the most evident benefit of the program for participating firms is reduced uncertainty about clearance times.","尽管贸易便利化作为贸易和发展政策的一个重要领域，但针对具体贸易便利化改革的成效评估却寥寥无几。本文对塞尔维亚实施的""企业自主通关""改革进行了评估，该改革允许符合资质的企业在自家仓库而非海关办公室完成清关手续。本研究采用的合并合成控制法，为破解贸易便利化改革评估中诸多实证难题提供了创新解决方案。该方法用于评估21家采用自主通关模式处理进口货物的企业在贸易成果上的因果效应。改革措施压缩了采用企业的清关时间分布，但对清关时间中位数、查验率和进口额的估计影响均未呈现统计显著性。异质性影响检验也未显示改革对采用企业产生差异化影响。总体而言，研究结果表明该计划为参与企业带来的最显著效益是降低了清关时间的不确定性。","International Trade and Trade Rules, Trade Facilitation, Transport Services, Trade and Services, Trade Policy",2016-07-19

Theory suggests several hypotheses for why it was not in the interest of many firms to lobby for protection, including much greater macroeconomic ""policy space"" today, the rise of intra-industry trade (specialization in specific varieties), and the fragmentation of production across global value chains ( ""vertical"" specialization and the associated growth of trade in intermediates). Institutions may also have played a role in limiting the extent of protectionist responses. World Trade Organization disciplines raise the cost of using trade policies for member countries and have proved to be a stable foundation for the open multilateral trading system that has been built over the last fifty years. This paper empirically examines the power of these and other theories to explain the observed pattern of trade policy responses to the 2008 crisis, using trade and protection data for seven large emerging market countries that have a history of active use of trade policy. Vertical specialization (global fragmentation) is found to be the most powerful economic factor determining trade policy responses.","2008-09年期间出现的贸易崩溃和产出萎缩，其严重程度堪比1930年的大萧条，在许多国家甚至更为剧烈，但并未引发类似大萧条后猖獗的保护主义。理论界提出了若干假说来解释企业为何缺乏游求保护的动力：当今宏观经济""政策空间""显著扩大、产业内贸易兴起（特定产品类别的专业化生产）、以及全球价值链带来的生产碎片化（""垂直""专业化及由此催生的中间品贸易增长）。制度因素也可能抑制了保护主义反应的蔓延——世贸组织规则提高了成员国实施贸易政策的成本，并为过去五十年构建的开放型多边贸易体系提供了稳定基石。本文通过七个曾频繁运用贸易政策的大型新兴市场国家的贸易与保护数据，实证检验了上述理论对2008年危机期间贸易政策反应模式的解释力。研究发现，垂直专业化（全球生产碎片化）是决定贸易政策反应的最重要经济因素。","Free Trade, Trade Policy, Economic Theory & Research, International Trade and Trade Rules, Debt Markets",2016-04-20

These countries have a combined economy (GDP) of over $27 trillion, comprising nearly 35 percent of global GDP and about one third of global trade. This “ambitious, next-generation” trade agreement will be Canada’s first foothold into prosperous Asian markets and will provide an opportunity for Canada to address outstanding issues with its two NAFTA partners. To date, the WTO has been the most significant and promising forum for multilateral trade liberalization, but negotiations have stalled and they are not likely to pick up momentum in the near future. As such, TPP membership is likely to broaden to include other countries seeking to liberalize trade relationships, such as the Philippines and South Korea. The prospect of China joining the negotiations in the short term is uncertain, but the country’s expression of interest underscores why the TPP is important: it has the potential to expand to include all Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries.

trade policy,Food Prices and the Multiplier Effect ofTradePolicy,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2613294,Paolo E. Giordani,"This paper studies the relationship between trade policy and food prices. We show that, when individuals are loss averse, governments may use trade policy to shield the domestic economy from large food price shocks. This creates a complementarity between the price of food in international markets and trade policy. Specifically, unilateral actions give rise to a ""multiplier effect"": when a shock drives up the price of food, exporters respond by imposing restrictions while importers wind down protection, thus exacerbating the initial shock and soliciting further trade policy activism. We test the key prediction of the theory with a new dataset that comprises monthly information on trade measures across 77 countries and 33 food products for the period 2008-11, finding evidence of a multiplier effect in food trade policy. These findings contribute to inform the broader debate on the proper regulation of food trade policy within the multilateral trading system.","本文研究了贸易政策与食品价格之间的关系。我们发现，当个体存在损失厌恶心理时，政府可能通过贸易政策来保护国内经济免受重大食品价格冲击的影响。这导致国际市场价格与贸易政策之间形成互补关系。具体而言，单边行动会产生""乘数效应""：当冲击推高食品价格时，出口国会实施限制措施，而进口国则会减少保护性政策，从而加剧初始冲击并引发更多贸易政策干预。我们通过包含2008-11年间77个国家、33种食品月度贸易措施信息的新数据集验证了该理论的核心预测，发现了食品贸易政策中存在乘数效应的证据。这些发现为多边贸易体系中食品贸易政策合理监管的广泛讨论提供了参考依据。","Food prices, Commodity price shocks, Trade policy, Econometric models, Loss aversion, Multiplier effect, Food crisis., domestic price, world price, global trade, import tariff, import subsidy, export supply, import demand, export taxes",2015-06-02

Instead, Democrats should set out the positive case for trade liberalization and the rule of law in international trade.To do so, they should look to the Constitution and reclaim the greater responsibility over trade for Congress envisioned there. Executive branch protectionism championed by President Trump has harmed the U.S. economy and worsened relationships with our allies. Congress needs to institute checks to make sure this does not happen again in the future. Democrats should also reengage in a constructive manner with U.S. trading partners in multilateral, bilateral, and regional settings. Working with allies, instead of against them, has its own rewards, and can also be used as a basis for addressing the challenge of China’s integration into the trading system.

Some trade diplomats are coming to recognize the greater significance of regional competition policy and law and are arguing that RTAs are likely to prevent to create anti-competitive cross border merger and acquisition business practices by firms. They advocate that competition-related provisions should be included in the framework of RTAs. Consequently, the adoption of these provisions in RTAs is expanding and becoming a trend in the regional trade landscape. On the contrary, trade scholars have long debated how regionalism may be able to contribute to the multilateral trading system. Due to the priority of market opening objectives in the trade liberalization process, they believe that lowering tariff barriers and removing a variety of non-tariff barriers are the principal issues to be addressed and that the implications of competition policy and law in enhancing trade welfare effects is not directly relevant to the objective pursued. Based on the relationship between regionalism and multilateralism in the contemporary trade discourse, this article discusses the prospects for the multilateral framework on competition policy and law and asks whether there is a link between these and at least the beginnings of a regulatory process at global level.",当前，区域贸易协定（RTAs）在全球贸易格局中呈现异常迅猛的增长态势。部分贸易外交官逐渐意识到区域竞争政策与法律更为深远的意义，主张RTAs有望遏制企业实施反竞争的跨境并购商业行为。他们倡议将竞争相关条款纳入RTAs框架体系。因此，这些条款在RTAs中的采用范围正持续扩大，逐渐成为区域贸易领域的新趋势。与此相反，贸易学者长期围绕区域主义如何促进多边贸易体系展开争论。由于贸易自由化进程中市场开放目标具有优先性，他们认为降低关税壁垒与消除各类非关税壁垒才是亟待解决的核心议题，而竞争政策与法律对提升贸易福利效应的影响与这一目标并无直接关联。本文基于当代贸易语境中区域主义与多边主义的互动关系，探讨竞争政策与法律多边框架的发展前景，并论证其与全球层面监管机制雏形之间是否存在关联。,"Regional Trade Agreement, International Competition Law and Policy",2011-05-10

On linkage, friend-shoring and the challenges for multilateralism",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4295009,Robert Wolfe,"Using trade policy to achieve foreign policy objectives has a long history. Punishing enemies and rewarding friends by granting or withholding market access, sanctions or blockades are venerable forms of trade policy used as foreign policy. A more recent form is the inclusion of noncommercial provisions in trade agreements. All these tools are based on linkage, premised on the assumption that a desired outcome can be achieved by interventions that would increase or decrease trade. The latest instance is so-called “friend-shoring”, which would in principle isolate enemies, although it will be difficult in practice and risks undermining multilateralism. The cost of these interventions is susceptible to economic analysis, even if the conclusion is that it is worth paying. Influenced by Alan Winters who called national security as a motivation for agriculture protection a “so-called non-economic objective” or SNO, I argue that using a trade policy tool for a foreign policy purpose as if there is no cost is a SNO job, an attempt to justify an intervention aimed at one objective by framing it as being valuable for another.","利用贸易政策实现外交目标由来已久。通过开放或限制市场准入、实施制裁或封锁来惩罚敌人、奖赏盟友，是贸易政策服务于外交的古老形式。较新的做法则是在贸易协定中加入非商业条款。这些工具都基于联动逻辑，其前提假设是通过增减贸易的干预手段能够达成预期目标。最新案例是所谓""友岸外包""，该政策原则上旨在孤立对手，但实践难度大且可能破坏多边主义。即便最终认定代价值得付出，这些干预措施的成本仍可进行经济分析。受艾伦·温特斯将农业保护的国家安全动机称为""所谓非经济目标""（SNO）的启发，我认为将贸易政策工具用于外交目标却无视成本的行为，实属SNO操作——这种干预本为某一目标，却试图通过包装成对另一目标有价值来正当化。",Noneconomic objectives; trade policy; foreign policy; linkage; multilateralism,2022-12-06

We examine empirically whether regional trade liberalisation is associated with deterioration (“race to the bottom”) of domestic labour standards beyond those reflected in the 1998 ILO Declaration on the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Using a panel of 90 developed and developing countries, covering the years from 1980 to 2005, we find that after the entry into force of a regional trade agreement (RTA), labour standards applying to employment protection and unemployment benefits are significantly weakened. We show that such a lowering of protection levels tends to occur in high income countries and that this effect mainly stems from RTAs among such countries rather than with low or middle income countries. Concern about competitive pressure to weaken domestic labour regulation is reflected in a variety of undertakings in RTAs not to administer labour laws with a view to improving one’s competitive position in trade or foreign direct investment (FDI). The above-mentioned empirical findings indicate that such provisions could potentially become relevant, and that this is more likely to be the case for high income members of RTAs. Our analysis, from a legal point of view, of relevant institutional and procedural mechanisms indicates however that enforceability of the relevant provisions is weak for most of the existing legal texts.","本文从法律和经济双重视角探讨了劳动力市场监管与区域贸易协定之间的关系。我们通过实证研究检验了区域贸易自由化是否会导致国内劳工标准（超出1998年国际劳工组织《工作中基本原则和权利宣言》所涵盖范畴的部分）出现""竞相逐底""式的恶化。基于1980-2005年间90个发达国家与发展中国家组成的面板数据，我们发现区域贸易协定生效后，涉及就业保护与失业救济的劳工标准显著弱化。研究表明这种保护水平下降现象主要发生在高收入国家，且源于高收入国家之间的区域贸易协定，而非其与中低收入国家签订的协定。对削弱国内劳工监管的竞争压力的担忧，体现在区域贸易协定中各类""不得通过劳动法规调整来提升贸易或外国直接投资竞争优势""的承诺条款中。上述实证结果表明此类条款可能具有现实意义，且更可能对区域贸易协定中的高收入成员方产生影响。然而我们从法律角度对相关制度程序机制的分析显示，现行法律文本中绝大多数相关条款的可执行性较弱。","international trade, labour market regulation, RTAs",2012-10-15

Will these labour provisions improve labour standards? This article takes up this question in relation to the ‘Labour’ chapter of the Comprehensive Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (‘CPTPP’). This chapter provides the crucial test for whether labour provisions (as currently framed) will improve labour standards, having been hailed by the United States government as providing ‘the strongest protections for workers of any trade agreement in history’.Contrary to rhetoric accompanying this chapter, this article argues that it is a form of neoliberal regulation – faux regulation. It stands forth as an example of such legalised minimalism for three reasons. First, it provides for flexible standards particularly through its heavy reliance on rights recognised in the 1998 ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Second, it lays down standards for flexibility through non-existent standards, liquid-soft obligations, and heavily qualified obligations.But third, the evidence shows that the parties to the agreement either have not ratified the core ILO Conventions on which the labour principles are based, or (using freedom of association as a case-study) are in breach of these obligations, sometimes in quite significant ways. The extent of non-compliance at the point of commencement raises serious questions about the integrity and purpose of the ‘Labour’ chapter. These reinforce the sense that the chapter is a form of faux regulation in which the parties have deliberately constructed a system of Mutually Assured Non-Compliance.The article concludes by sketching out the broader implications of its analysis for other labour provisions and identifying ways to go beyond faux regulation.","贸易协定中涉及劳工标准的条款（劳工条款）显著增加。这些劳工条款能否提升劳工标准？本文针对《全面与进步跨太平洋伙伴关系协定》（CPTPP）的""劳工""章节探讨这一问题。该章节为验证现行框架下的劳工条款能否改善劳工标准提供了关键样本——美国政府曾宣称其""建立了史上贸易协定中最强有力的劳工保护机制""。本文认为，与相关宣传辞令相反，该章节实质是新自由主义监管的变体——虚假监管。其法律形式主义的特征体现在三方面：首先通过大量援引1998年国际劳工组织《工作中的基本原则和权利宣言》确立的权益，构建了弹性标准体系；其次通过虚无标准、流变性软义务及高度受限的义务条款确立灵活性准则。最具说服力的是第三点证据：协定缔约方要么未批准相关劳工原则所依据的核心国际劳工公约，要么（以结社自由为例证）存在显著违约行为。这种生效之初即存在的系统性违约现象，对""劳工""章节的完整性与立法初衷提出了严峻质疑，进一步印证了其作为""相互确保不履约""虚假监管体系的本质。文末通过分析此类条款的广泛影响，提出了超越虚假监管的可行路径。","trade agreements, labour provisions, Comprehensive Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, neoliberal regulation, faux regulation",2020-07-15

In particular, we review a forthcoming  law review article, Bank Supervision and Administrative Law, by former Federal Reserve Governor and current Harvard Law School Professor, Daniel Tarullo, that asserts that the APA does not fully apply to bank supervision and regulation by the Fed.The statement begins by summarizing the procedural requirements applicable to any U.S. federal agency action set forth in the APA.  It then reviews Professor Tarullo’s analysis of the procedural requirements that apply to Federal Reserve stress testing, highlighting his argument that certain banking statutes on capital regulation may overrule the administrative law requirements that would otherwise apply to stress testing practices. The statement concludes by reviewing case law on administrative law “exceptionalism,” showing that it does not support Professor Tarullo’s claim for exceptionalist treatment of banking supervision and regulation.",在本声明中，资本市场监管委员会（“委员会”）重申其一贯立场，即《行政程序法》（“APA”）完全适用于美国联邦储备委员会（“美联储”）的监管行动。我们特别审阅了前美联储理事、现任哈佛法学院教授丹尼尔·塔鲁洛即将发表的法律评论文章《银行监管与行政法》，该文主张APA不全面适用于美联储的银行监管活动。声明首先概述了APA对所有美国联邦机构行动的程序要求，随后分析了塔鲁洛教授关于美联储压力测试程序要求的论述，重点指出其主张——资本监管相关的某些银行法规可能优先于通常适用于压力测试实践的行政法要求。声明最后通过审视行政法“例外主义”的相关判例法，表明现有司法实践并不支持塔鲁洛教授提出的银行监管应享有例外主义待遇的观点。,,2021-11-12

Negotiations in the Working Group on Domestic Regulation have produced a considerable level of consensus in recent years, but some critics claim that this consensus was reached at the expense of developing only shallow disciplines. In any event, a draft on Domestic Regulation disciplines has not yet been finalised in the WTO context. At the same time, numerous regional and bilateral trade agreements (PTAs) covering trade in services have been concluded since the entry into force of the GATS. This raises the question of whether and to what extent such PTAs have developed any further disciplines on domestic regulation and whether such disciplines could be used as a model for the GATS. Initial research suggests that the potential for more advanced general rules on domestic regulation in FTAs may not be as great as one would expect. However, many of these agreements contain chapters on regulatory rules and principles for specific sectors which should be further studied and developed.",制定非歧视性国内法规的规则仍是《服务贸易总协定》(GATS)未完成议程的关键要素之一。近年来，国内法规工作组的谈判已达成相当程度的共识，但有批评指出这种共识是以仅形成浅层次纪律为代价的。无论如何，关于国内法规纪律的草案尚未在世贸组织框架内最终定案。与此同时，自GATS生效以来，已缔结大量涵盖服务贸易的区域和双边贸易协定(PTAs)。这引发了一个问题：此类PTAs是否以及在何种程度上制定了更进一步的国内法规纪律，这些纪律能否作为GATS的范本。初步研究表明，自由贸易协定中制定更先进的国内法规通用规则的潜力可能不及预期。但许多协定包含针对特定领域的监管规则和原则章节，这些内容值得进一步研究和发展。,"GATS, domestic regulation, free trade agreements",2015-08-24
trade regulation,Introduction: Digital Technologies and InternationalTradeRegulation,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1934805,Mira Burri,"Digital technologies have had and continue to have profound effects on societal life. The transformations range from the trivial to the momentous – from online shopping, through the emergence of global value chains, to the very ways we work and communicate, create, distribute and access information. International trade regulation has so far not reacted in a forward-looking manner to the digital revolution, and in particular at the multilateral level, legal engineering has yielded few tangible results. Despite the lack of deliberate response so far and irrespective of Doha, the law of the World Trade Organization (WTO) possesses intrinsic flexibility and resilience, both in the substance and in the procedural mechanisms, that may still appropriately accommodate the changes brought about by burgeoning digital trade. This adaptive governance intrinsic to the WTO may nonetheless be insufficient, as the digital networked environment raises more fundamental and complex questions that transcend market access and liberalisation, and demand cooperation and coherent regulatory design. The present paper is the introductory chapter to a book that seeks to reveal the potential, as well as the limitations of the WTO framework with regard to digital trade.",数字技术已经并将持续对社会生活产生深远影响。这些变革涵盖从琐碎到重大的方方面面——从在线购物，到全球价值链的兴起，再到我们工作、交流、创造、传播和获取信息的基本方式。迄今为止，国际贸易规则尚未对数字革命作出前瞻性回应，特别是在多边层面，法律构建鲜有实质性成果。尽管目前缺乏针对性应对且多哈回合停滞不前，但世界贸易组织（WTO）法律在实体规则和程序机制上具有内在的灵活性与适应性，仍可能妥善容纳蓬勃发展的数字贸易带来的变革。然而，WTO这种与生俱来的适应性治理机制或许仍显不足，因为数字化网络环境引发了更为根本且复杂的议题，这些问题超越了市场准入与自由化范畴，要求各国开展合作并构建协调一致的监管框架。本文作为某著作的导论章节，旨在揭示WTO框架在数字贸易领域的潜力与局限。,"digital technologies, digital trade, international trade regulation, WTO law and policy",2011-09-28

This chapter discusses the multi-level interaction of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and Fair Trade regimes with state-based legal systems. It opens with an analysis of the potential problems arising when multiple systems are overlaid upon each other. In particular, the chapter explores two conflicting arguments concerning how regulatory approaches coincide with ‘softer’ private efforts: firstly, that regulation can crowd out voluntary private efforts, thereby diminishing their effectiveness and legitimacy; and the second, countervailing argument that Fair Trade systems and regulation can be complimentary and mutually reinforcing. It then discusses ways to better synthesize state and non-state governance initiatives, analyzing the examples of highly visible multinational corporations (MNCs) such as Nike and Wal-Mart, as well as examples from recent policy developments in the United States in the areas of safety, discrimination, and environmental regulation.","企业社会责任（CSR）运动与公平贸易体系在过去十年间不断发展，这反映出一种信念：在全球层面运营的企业应自愿承担提高生产和贸易标准的责任，而消费者也应在推动行业负责任行为方面发挥作用。本章探讨了企业社会责任（CSR）与公平贸易制度同国家法律体系之间的多层次互动关系，首先分析了多重体系叠加时可能产生的问题，特别聚焦于两种相互冲突的观点——关于监管方式如何与""较温和""的私营领域举措相协调的争论：其一是认为监管可能排挤私营领域的自愿努力，从而削弱其效力与正当性；其二则持相反观点，认为公平贸易体系与监管能够互补互强。随后本章通过分析耐克、沃尔玛等备受关注的跨国公司案例，以及美国近期在安全、反歧视和环境监管等领域的政策发展实例，探讨了如何更好地整合国家与非国家治理举措。","international law, governance, regulation, fair trade, soft law",2010-05-21

These are fueled by three major developments in the AnGR sector: the increasing volume in trade in animal products; the scientific progress in animal breeding with the advances in genetic engineering; and the so-called erosion of animal genetic resources. The World Trade Institute of the University of Bern, which has previously deepened the studies on the question of rights to plant genetic resources and traditional knowledge in the international trading system, took up these issues. One year after the adoption of the Animal Genetic Resources Global Plan of Action by the International Technical Conference on Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (AnGRFA), it gathered a pool of experts to discuss the interface of AnGRFA, international trade and property rights. The result of this exchange is at the centre of this report.",关于动物遗传资源权利创设的探讨背后，交织着不同的思想脉络和多样的论证路径。这一讨论受到动物遗传资源领域三大发展趋势的推动：动物产品贸易量的持续增长；基因工程技术推动下动物育种科学的进步；以及所谓的动物遗传资源侵蚀现象。伯尔尼大学世界贸易研究所曾就国际贸易体系中植物遗传资源和传统知识权利问题开展过深入研究，此次将研究视角转向该领域。在《动物遗传资源全球行动计划》于粮食和农业动物遗传资源国际技术会议通过一年后，研究所召集专家团队，共同探讨动物遗传资源与国际贸易及知识产权制度的交叉议题。本报告的核心内容正是此次研讨的成果结晶。,"Property, animal genetic resources, intellectual property, patents, AnGR, AnGRFA, biotechnology, conservation, Interlaken declaration",2010-08-03
trade regulation,"Regulation,Tradeand Economic Growth",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2635507,Jens Koeniger,"The role of regulatory quality as one of the so-called deep determinants of growth has emerged as an important issue in economic research in the past 20 years. The positive or negative growth effects of a country’s regulatory framework are amplified by economic integration, which makes factors and producers more mobile and enables them to avoid burdensome regulation. Therefore, the two potential determinants to growth might be interlinked. So far there is very little empirical evidence on the impact of the regulatory framework in an integrated economy on growth. We deal with the most common problems in estimating growth equations by using internal instruments to identify a causal relationship between regulation and growth in the presence of international trade and find evidence that both regulation and trade have a significant positive influence on growth, with the effect of regulation being especially pronounced for countries that have worse regulatory quality and for middle-income countries.",在过去20年中，监管质量作为所谓经济增长深层决定因素之一的作用，已成为经济研究的重要议题。一国监管框架对经济增长的促进或抑制作用会因经济一体化而被放大——经济一体化使生产要素和生产者更具流动性，使其能够规避繁重的监管。因此，这两个潜在的增长决定因素可能存在关联。目前关于一体化经济中监管框架对增长影响的实证证据非常有限。我们通过使用内部工具变量来解决增长方程估计中最常见的问题，从而在国际贸易存在的情况下识别监管与增长之间的因果关系，并发现监管和贸易都对增长具有显著正向影响，其中监管效应对监管质量较差的国家和中等收入国家尤为明显。,"institution, integration, regulation, openness, trade, growth",2015-07-26

Only integrated electricity markets and well-designed regulatory frameworks can deliver and maintain cost-effective electricity systems. Interconnected electricity systems, in their turn, can contribute to the objectives of low carbon economy, as cross-border electricity networks can integrate large-scale renewable energy sources. This paper explores the challenges related to the regulatory environment for the construction of cross-border electricity transmission links. It looks at regulatory aspects and public international law issues of cross-border energy trade and investment and international and regional cooperation related to the construction of cross-border electricity networks. First, it examines the right to construct transmission under the law of the World Trade Organization (WTO), focusing on the transit provisions of Article V of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and related obligations under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM). Second, it discusses rights and obligations arising from the participation at energy-specific international treaties, such as the non-impediment obligation under Article 7 of the Energy Charter Treaty. Third, it looks at the potential of creating legal guarantees for investors under regional trade and energy-specific agreements.

In the latest TRIPS Council meeting of 11-12 June 2013, WTO Members have accepted this reality and granted LDCs a second extension of the transition period for another eight years. This working paper seeks to assist future discussions on how to meaningfully integrate the poorest countries into the WTO system for the protection of intellectual property. The authors first provide a comprehensive legal analysis of the various rights and obligations for LDCs, developed country Members and international organizations under the transitional arrangements in the TRIPS Agreement, subsequent WTO legislation and in particular the TRIPS Council Decisions of November 2005 and June 2013. The text also contains on overview on the underlying factors and processes that lead to these progressive extensions of the transition period for LDCs till July 2021. It then identifies substantial shortcomings of the current situation following the Decision of June 2013. Above all, there is still need for greater coordination on the national and multilateral level in order to provide incentives to LDCs to engage in this process and to unlock increased technical and financial assistance for LDCs. The authors then propose potential avenues for WTO Members to move forward: The priority needs assessment process should be reformed and additional incentives should be identified for WTO Members to cooperate more actively towards LDCs’ integration in the global IP system.

It argues that the placing of a quota on the number of foreign RE certificates eligible for tax exemptions would likely affect the volumes of imported green electricity and therefore trigger a violation of GATT rules. At the same time, restrictions on the eligibility of RE certificates might be defended under WTO law if they are based on qualitative criteria, such as the attachment of RE certificates to green electricity flows or to a green electricity label that is equally available to domestic and foreign suppliers of RE electricity.","本文探讨了基于可再生能源证书实施差别化电力税以促进绿色电力生产的各种设计方案在法律上的可行性。文章结合世贸组织最新判例分析了""同类产品""认定问题，并研究了在《关税及贸易总协定》一般例外条款下差别化税率正当化的可能性。研究同时审视了不同税收设计方案（包括使用可再生能源证书进行税收减免）可能面临的法律障碍。文章指出，对符合免税条件的外国可再生能源证书设置数量配额可能会影响绿色电力进口量，从而构成对《关税及贸易总协定》规则的违反。但另一方面，若对可再生能源证书资格的限制是基于定性标准（如要求证书必须绑定绿色电力实际输送或国内外供应商均可平等获取的绿色电力标识），则可能获得世贸组织法律框架下的正当性辩护。","Electricity tax, Renewable energy certificate, Green electricity label, Electricity import restrictions, WTO law, GATT rules",2016-04-15
trade regulation,Price Caps versus Reimbursement Limits: PharmaceuticalRegulationunder Market Integration through ParallelTrade,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3360651,Laura Birg,"In this paper, I study the effect of parallel trade (cross border resale of goods without the authorization of the manufacturer) on pharmaceutical regulation in a North-South framework with a firms endogenous decision to export to the South. Governments in both countries may limit prices directly via price caps or restrict third-party payer reimbursement for the drug via reimbursement limits.Parallel trade may relax regulation in the source country of parallel imports (South) and intensify regulation in the destination country (North): In the source country, parallel trade may relax regulation both under a price cap and a reimbursement limit under certain conditions. In the destination country, parallel trade has no effect on the level of regulation under a price cap, and it intensies regulation under a reimbursement limit.Parallel trade may change regulatory preferences: Under no parallel trade, both the source and destination country set prices caps. Under parallel trade, the source country sets a price cap, but the destination country sets a reimbursement, thereby enforcing a higher price cap in the South. This implies higher drug prices under parallel trade in both source and destination country.",本文研究了平行贸易（未经制造商授权的跨境商品转售）在南北框架下对药品监管的影响，其中企业自主决定是否向南方国家出口。两国政府可通过价格上限直接限制药品价格，或通过报销限额限制第三方支付方的药品报销。平行贸易可能放松平行进口来源国（南方）的监管，同时加强目标国（北方）的监管：在来源国，特定条件下平行贸易可能同时放宽价格上限和报销限额的监管；在目标国，平行贸易对价格上限监管无影响，但会强化报销限额监管。平行贸易可能改变监管偏好：无平行贸易时，两国均设定价格上限；存在平行贸易时，来源国设定价格上限而目标国采用报销制度，从而导致南方国家实施更高的价格上限。这意味着平行贸易下来源国与目标国的药品价格均会上涨。,"pharmaceutical regulation, price cap, reimbursement limit, parallel trade",2019-04-25

The domestic challenge stems from each country's prerogative to regulate in its own jurisdiction, while the international challenge relates to the aim to promote the progressive liberalization of trade in services. Experience gained in goods trade indicates that the principle of necessity can be a useful proxy allowing WTO adjudicating bodies to draw the dividing line between legitimate regulation and protectionist abuse. This paper explores the possibility of creating a necessity test that would be applicable to all service sectors. Such a horizontal test may yet emerge from the ongoing negotiations within the Working Party on Domestic Regulation (WPDR), which aim to fulfil the legal mandate contained in Article VI:4 GATS.",必要性测试是一种工具，旨在平衡两种可能相互冲突的利益或挑战——一种主要涉及国内性质，另一种则更具国际或多边特征。国内挑战源于各国在其管辖范围内制定法规的自主权，而国际挑战则与推动服务贸易逐步自由化的目标相关。货物贸易领域的经验表明，必要性原则可作为有效标准，帮助世贸组织裁决机构区分合法监管与保护主义滥用。本文探讨了建立一种适用于所有服务部门的必要性测试的可能性。此类横向测试可能通过国内法规工作组（WPDR）正在进行的谈判形成，该谈判旨在落实《服务贸易总协定》第六条第4款规定的法律授权。,"World Trade Organization, General Agreement on Trade in Services, trade in services, Doha Development Round, services negotiations, domestic regulation, necessity test, regulatory reform, regulatory diversity, good governance, Regional Integration Agreements",2008-01-30

Referring to all legislations that may be applicable in this context, we address some actual governance issues and analyze some acts that have been recently adopted (participation of nongovernmental experts, federal act on transparency, federal act on participation, federal act on parliament). In a first step, we assume that the modalities of this decision-making process are a function of the regime of competence that prevails in the phase of ratification, at the national level, of the international act incorporating the result of the negotiations.  Therefore we start by analyzing the various regimes of competence that may apply in this context. In a second step, we consider different facets of the making of Switzerland's positions. We address the legal dispositions that frame the various channels of participation that drive the process. After analyzing the executive's work procedures, which has a general competence in the matter, we address parliament's and the non-state actors' mechanisms of participation.  We choose on purpose not to address the canton's mechanisms of participation.

Fewer goods and services originate “from” any one place or any one supplier, but rather consist of components and tasks from multiple suppliers scattered across several countries. Consistent, adequate, and predictable regulation is essential to the success of these global supply chains, but remains elusive. Without international coordination, national regulations and private standards have proliferated. The resulting cacophony has done little to promote U.S. exports or effective regulatory oversight.

It examines the subjects of transparency, regulatory cooperation, competition law and policy and their institutional context in order to assess the depth of integration generated and the level of compatibility that results between the agreements. The article determines that many of the subjects are treated in a softer law manner that establishes ongoing systems of cooperation in order to realise the agreements’ objectives of addressing regulatory barriers for foreign services and service providers. In some cases these softer law approaches may reflect the policy space parties choose to retain in their own domestic systems for balancing trade and regulatory objectives. For most of the subjects, the approaches employed are similar, suggesting that the two agreements are rendered generally compatible for the types of regulatory activities incurred by the common signatory. The two subject areas of transparency and sector-specific domestic regulation present some more legally binding and actionable elements and there are some differences between the agreements in how these elements are addressed. For these, there is more risk of regulatory fragmentation as between the agreements and questions can be raised as to how this is resolved by a national regulatory system. Finally, the article considers some implications for the multilateral trading system of the World Trade Organization presented by the provisions examined in these agreements. To the extent that softer regulatory approaches emphasise the building of agency relationships over time, one can question whether this is a likely possible model of a larger group of WTO members. For those subjects that present somewhat more rigorous legal approaches, one can more easily consider how these models might translate to the WTO discussion as potential benchmarks for enhancing multilateral trade in services.",本文比较了涉及大韩民国的两项经济一体化协定在国际服务贸易领域的国内监管条款：即《美利坚合众国与大韩民国自由贸易协定》（2011年）和《欧洲联盟与大韩民国自由贸易协定》（2011年）。研究聚焦透明度、监管合作、竞争法律与政策三大主题及其制度框架，旨在评估协定产生的整合深度与相互兼容程度。文章指出，多数议题采用软法处理方式，通过建立持续性合作机制来实现消除外国服务及服务提供商监管壁垒的协定目标。某些情况下，这种软法路径可能反映了缔约方为平衡贸易与监管目标而在国内体系中保留的政策空间。就大部分议题而言，两项协定采用的处理方式高度相似，表明共同签署方开展的监管活动具有总体兼容性。透明度与行业特定国内监管这两个主题领域存在更具法律约束力和可操作性的要素，且两项协定对这些要素的处理存在差异。这些差异可能导致协定间的监管碎片化风险，并引发国家监管体系如何解决此类问题的思考。最后，文章探讨了协定条款对世界贸易组织多边贸易体系的潜在影响。鉴于软性监管路径强调长期机构关系建设，值得探讨这是否可能成为更广泛世贸成员群体的可行模式。而对于那些采用相对严格法律路径的议题，更容易考量如何将这些模式转化为世贸组织讨论中促进服务贸易多边化的潜在基准。,"regional trade agreements, trade in services, domestic regulation, WTO",2013-11-18

trade regulation,Closer Cooperation and Coordination in CompetitionRegulationin ASEAN and Their Impact onTradeLiberalization,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2385516,Haniff Ahamat,"This article looks into the regional implementations of competition regulation in ASEAN and their impact on trade liberalization. The AEC has required ASEAN Member States (“AMS”) to introduce their own domestic competition laws by 2015. At the moment, the ASEAN Regional Guidelines on Competition Policy 2010 serves as a general framework for AMS to introduce, implement, and enforce competition policy and law (“CPL”). However, to date, there is no regional legal framework regulating competition and no regional body overseeing the administration of CPL at the ASEAN level. This article argues that the creation of such a legal and institutional framework for competition is hindered by the lack of consistency between existing competition laws in AMS and the different political, economic and legal environments there. This brings the discussion to the possible results of regionalization of competition regulation in ASEAN — utilization of extra-territorial power of the individual CRB of AMS and limited level of regional cooperation. This article finds that these outcomes pose several challenges to trade liberalization through the overuse, underuse and disuse of competition law itself and the use of trade defense laws (such as anti-dumping law) that has adverse effects on competition. This article proposes consultation and coordination as the means to minimize the conflicts between competition regulation and trade liberalization and prevent the use of competition regulation as a barrier to intra-ASEAN trade and beyond.",本文探讨了东盟地区竞争法规的区域性实施及其对贸易自由化的影响。东盟经济共同体要求成员国在2015年前制定国内竞争法。目前，《2010年东盟竞争政策区域指南》为成员国引入、实施和执行竞争政策与法律提供了总体框架。然而至今，东盟层面既缺乏规范竞争的区域性法律框架，也未设立监督竞争政策与法律执行的区域性机构。本文认为，由于成员国现有竞争法之间缺乏一致性，加之各国政治、经济及法律环境差异，阻碍了此类竞争法律与制度框架的建立。由此引发了对东盟竞争法规区域化可能结果的讨论——成员国竞争监管机构对域外管辖权的过度运用，以及区域合作水平的局限性。研究发现，这些结果通过竞争法的滥用、闲置或不当使用，以及具有反竞争效应的贸易救济法（如反倾销法）的运用，对贸易自由化构成了多重挑战。本文建议通过协商与协调机制，最大限度减少竞争法规与贸易自由化之间的冲突，防止竞争监管成为东盟内外贸易的壁垒。,"competition law, international trade regulation, economic regionalism",2014-02-24

As tariffs and other non-regulatory measures were reduced, the extent to which cross-national differences in regulation impeded trade became more apparent, especially to multinational firms which pushed for attenuations of these regulatory trade barriers. Once regulations became the subject of trade negotiations in the 1980s, civil society groups with a vested interested in those regulations became involved in trade politics to a greater degree than ever before.These developments have shaped the major trade negotiations underway today and are likely to remain at the centre of trade politics for the foreseeable future.",关税曾是国际贸易的主要壁垒，而如今跨国监管差异构成了贸易的最大障碍，因而成为当代贸易谈判的核心议题。这一转变对全球经济和国际政治经济学研究具有深远影响。本文通过剖析这一演变过程，探讨监管规则如何影响贸易，并揭示围绕这些监管性贸易壁垒谈判的政治博弈。随着关税及其他非监管措施逐步削减，各国监管差异对贸易的阻碍作用愈发凸显——尤其对积极推动削弱此类壁垒的跨国企业而言。自20世纪80年代监管议题进入贸易谈判领域，与这些监管规则存在利益关联的民间社会组织便以前所未有的程度介入贸易政治。这些发展态势塑造了当前进行中的重大贸易谈判格局，并可能在可预见的未来持续占据贸易政治的核心地位。,"Trade, multinational corporations, activists, WTO",2022-09-09

However, this positive impact needs to be broad-based or inclusive, particularly in the context of South Africa given its legacy of non-inclusive growth and persistent inequality. An area where increased participation is important in achieving more inclusive growth in a developing country context is in the procurement of large-scale infrastructure. The South African experience with procuring large-scale renewable energy-based electricity generation capacity carries interesting lessons in this respect. The paper reviews the development of South Africa's large-scale renewable energy sector from an economic regulation and inclusive growth lens. The regulatory framework governing the sector is examined, looking at both the policy and institutional environment, and their role in contributing to inclusive growth objectives. As such, the paper investigates the role that economic regulation can play in stimulating inclusive growth, through the promotion of both competitive and socio-economic outcomes. The paper also looks at the importance of factoring vested interests in order to maximize inclusive growth outcomes through economic regulation.",经济监管，包括竞争政策，本身并非目的而是实现目标的手段，最终必须对整个经济产生积极影响。然而这种积极影响需要具有广泛基础或包容性，尤其在南非背景下——鉴于该国长期存在非包容性增长和持续不平等的历史。在发展中国家背景下，提高参与度对实现更具包容性增长尤为重要的领域是大规模基础设施采购。南非在采购大规模可再生能源发电能力方面的经验为此提供了有益启示。本文从经济监管与包容性增长视角审视了南非大规模可再生能源行业的发展历程，分析了该领域的监管框架，包括政策与制度环境及其对实现包容性增长目标的作用。由此，本文探讨了经济监管如何通过促进竞争性成果与社会经济成果来推动包容性增长，同时研究了在制定经济监管政策时考量既得利益因素对最大化包容性增长成果的重要性。,"renewable energy, regulation, inclusive growth, South Africa",2016-01-15
trade regulation,FairTradeas an Instrument for theRegulationof Risks in the Cross-Border Surrogacy Market,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3862094,Sharon Bassan,"Cross-border surrogacy transactions [CBST] entail several risks for the participants and the resulting child, and consequentially, for their states. In the absence of clear standards or coherent legal rules, the global industry depends on private contracts, the result of negotiations between parties from different countries with unequal bargaining power, which distribute risks and benefits unfairly. In this paper I suggest a Fair Trade model as an instrument for the regulation of these transactions.The Fair Trade model addresses market failures and the externalization of risks. The basic principles of Fair Trade include trading process according to proper standards of quality and ethics based on a certification mechanism, a minimum price to producers, direct purchasing, transparent rules and fair distribution. In addition to quality and ethics, Fair Trade is a developmental tool, ensuring more of the economic benefits to producers in the global south.Applying these elements on the cross-border surrogacy market can be fruitful for the regulation of risks entailed in CBST. Certification of surrogacy services can ensure proper medical standards and fundamental rights, and decrease health risks; direct purchasing through democratically elected surrogates’ co-operatives could improve surrogates power of negotiation and decrease contractual risks; a minimum price could guarantee a greater income to surrogates, and social premium could be used to fund communal projects and help surrogates to improve their social position.

Results indicate that unionized plants and plants with relatively strong unions discharge more pollution relative to permitted limits than non-unionized plants and plants with relatively weak unions. However, results provide only weak evidence that plants with relatively strong unions incur more compliance violations than plants with relatively weak unions.

In particular, maximum wholesale margins, a restriction of pricing by the intermediary, and mandatory rebates, a restriction of the pricing by the manufacturer, are analyzed with respect to their effect on drug prices, quantities, and public pharmaceutical expenditure. Maximum wholesale margins enhance the manufacturers ability to reduce competition from parallel trade in the destination country by increasing wholesale prices.

Mandatory rebates may be a policy alternative, as they exhibit a reinforcing effect with respect to drug prices.",本文研究了药品批发环节监管在平行贸易（即制造商授权分销渠道之外的交易）整合市场情况下的影响。重点分析了最高批发利润率（对中间商定价的限制）与强制返利（对制造商定价的限制）对药品价格、销量及公共药品支出的调控作用。最高批发利润率会通过提高批发价格增强制造商削弱目标国平行贸易竞争的能力。在对称均衡状态下，两国实施的最高批发利润率政策会产生部分相互抵消效应。强制返利政策可作为替代方案，因其对药品价格具有协同强化作用。,"parallel trade, regulation, maximum markups, spillovers, mandatory rebates",2013-12-17
trade regulation,TradeSpecialization in the Gravity Model of InternationalTrade,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1549323,Dan Ciuriak,"One criticism of the gravity model of international trade is that it takes no account of comparative advantage. This critique is particularly important when the gravity model is considered for policy applications such as identifying priority markets for trade promotion programs. For example, the potential for trade expansion might be greater with countries with complementary patterns of comparative advantage than those with similar patterns. We introduce a trade specialization variable into a gravity model to capture the degree of complementarity of trading partners' comparative advantage. This short paper describes the test of this thesis. Our general findings are as follows: The trade specialization index clearly distinguishes countries that are generally believed to be ""most similar"" from those that are believed to ""most different."" Its explanatory power in the gravity equation is good, comparing well with other established variables and it improves the overall goodness of fit of the gravity equation. It thus appears to be a useful addition to the gravity model toolkit. At the same time, it still leaves a large residual unexplained variation that weakens the gravity model's utility for some policy applications.","对国际贸易引力模型的一个批评是它没有考虑比较优势。当引力模型被用于政策应用时，如确定贸易促进计划的优先市场，这一批评尤为重要。例如，与比较优势模式互补的国家相比，与比较优势模式相似的国家之间贸易扩张的潜力可能更大。我们在引力模型中引入了一个贸易专业化变量，以捕捉贸易伙伴比较优势的互补程度。这篇短文描述了对这一论点的检验。我们的主要发现如下：贸易专业化指数清楚地区分了通常被认为""最相似""的国家和被认为""最不同""的国家。它在引力方程中的解释力良好，与其他既定变量相比表现不错，并提高了引力方程的整体拟合优度。因此，它似乎是引力模型工具包中有用的补充。同时，它仍然留下了大量无法解释的残差变化，这削弱了引力模型在某些政策应用中的实用性。","Gravity model, comparative advantage, trade specialization index",2010-02-07
trade regulation,The Demands for EnvironmentalRegulationand forTradein the Presence of Private Mitigation,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1319677,Louis Hotte,"We study the nature of individual demands for environmental regulation and for trade openness in the general equilibrium of a small open economy where the environment is an input to production. Differences in the ability of individuals to afford private mitigation of the adverse consequences of pollution is a central feature of the analysis. Private mitigation leads to an endogenous, unequal distribution of the health-related consequences of pollution across income groups in a manner consistent with epidemiologic studies, in contrast to much of the literature which assumes equal health effects for all. We show that when private mitigation is possible at a cost, trade polarizes the interests of rich and poor with respect to the stringency of regulation. Moreover, even though trade has the potential to benefit everyone, the poor may oppose trade openness because of a concern that laxer environmental regulation will then be imposed in the interest of the rich. We explain why heterogeneity in the intensity of preferences, and not just in their direction, is likely to play a role in the determination of collective choices with respect to the regulation of the environment and of trade.

Successor liability is an equitable state law doctrine that allows a company's creditors to seek damages from a different company that either acquired the assets of or merged with the debtor company. Federal agencies, charged with promulgating regulations for and enforcing the international trade statutes, have sought to justify their occasionally successful attempts to impose successor liability on diverse grounds, but none can point to a clear statutory authorization, and none has advanced a particularly cogent policy rationale for these aggressive enforcement practices.If the adoption of successor liability in international trade regulation was intended to enhance deterrence, it raises the question of whether such measures are effectively directed at the individuals and companies that risk violating the law. The legality and constitutionality of the practice also merit closer scrutiny than they have received. This Article offers both an analysis of a specific issue of increasing importance and a case study of how federal regulatory agencies are using their discretion to achieve what Laura Nader called little injustices that aggregate to form major systemic injustice.  The specific focus of the present study is on the ways in which international trade regulatory agencies have recently begun incorporating the equitable principles of successor liability into trade regulatory regimes to justify punishing innocent purchasers of corporate assets for international trade law violations committed by entirely different parties, the asset sellers.","继承责任理论在国际贸易法中的应用相对较新，自世纪之交以来迅速兴起。继承责任是一项衡平法上的州法律原则，允许公司债权人向收购债务人公司资产或与之合并的另一家公司追索赔偿。负责颁布并执行国际贸易法规的联邦机构试图为其偶尔成功的继承责任追究尝试寻找各种依据，但无一能明确指出明确的法律授权，也未能对这些激进执法行为提出特别有说服力的政策理由。若在国际贸易监管中引入继承责任旨在加强威慑，则引发了一个问题：此类措施是否有效针对可能违法的个人和企业。该做法的合法性与合宪性也值得比目前更严格的审视。本文既对日益重要的具体问题进行分析，也通过案例研究揭示联邦监管机构如何利用自由裁量权制造劳拉·纳德所称的""微小不公""——这些不公累积形成重大的系统性不公。本研究具体关注国际贸易监管机构近来如何将继承责任的衡平原则纳入贸易监管体系，用以惩罚与违法行为完全无关的企业资产购买方（其违法行为实际由资产出售方实施）的现象。","international trade law, successor liability, trade regulation",2009-05-17

While the general international law perspective on economic sanctions is one of permissiveness within the limits of humanitarian and human rights law, the law of the World Trade Organization restricts its Members from applying economic sanctions against other Members unless the trade restricting measures fall within the general exceptions provisions.

Some of these are recognized by most, if not all market participants as legitimate (data protection laws, measures to combat fraud, as well as the enforcement of intellectual property rights), whereas others are seen as merely disguised protectionism (onerous and/or opaque registration or licensing rules and the heavy-handed application of censorship policies to name just two). This paper discusses the use that is increasingly being contemplated or made of trade rules, particularly WTO disciplines, to tackle those constraints that are viewed as either disguised protectionism or a breach of WTO commitments. It discusses the scope of these rules, the uses they have been put to in order to pry open services markets up to now, and the likely limits of their application. It also looks at how those interests most concerned with exporting goods and services via the internet have recognized the limits posed by existing trade rules - at least implicitly - and how they are seeking to address these shortcomings by drafting new rules, either at the WTO or in fora such as bilateral and plurilateral trade agreements.",若干法律框架和政策对获取特定商品、服务及其他网络内容施加了多重限制。其中部分限制（如数据保护法、反欺诈措施及知识产权执法）被绝大多数市场参与者认可为合理举措，而另一些则被视为变相保护主义（仅举两例：繁琐且不透明的注册许可规定，以及严苛的内容审查政策）。本文探讨贸易规则（尤其是世贸组织纪律）正被日益考虑或用于应对这类被视为隐蔽保护主义或违反世贸承诺的限制措施，分析这些规则的适用范围、迄今在撬开服务市场中的实际应用及其潜在边界。研究同时揭示了互联网商品服务出口利益相关方对现有贸易规则局限性的认知（至少是默示认知），以及他们通过世贸组织或双边/诸边贸易协定等平台制定新规则以弥补缺陷的探索路径。,"international trade, internet regulation, trade barriers, WTO dispute settlement, e-commerce",2012-06-02

Egger,"Since about a decade, we have seen a surge in interest as well as in the use of services preferentialism and unilateral services regulations. This paper provides an economic explanation of services regulation and services preferentialism, including their interaction. The paper derives hypotheses based on a numerical welfare analysis where tradable services are treated as a secondary (produced) input in the production of tradable goods. Apart from hypotheses on the emergence of services trade agreements (STAs), the paper derives ones on the stringency of unilateral services provision- a general services trade restrictiveness. For instance, one of the hypotheses is that services trade restrictiveness is endogenous, and it is aligned with economic fundamentals. Another hypothesis suggests that countries are more likely to participate in STAs if the partners' general, unilateral services trade restrictiveness is more similar to theirs. These and other hypotheses are supported by data.",近十年来，人们对服务优惠主义与单边服务规制的兴趣和使用显著增长。本文从经济学角度阐释了服务规制与服务优惠主义及其相互作用机制。研究通过数值福利分析推导出理论假设，其中将可交易服务视为可交易商品生产中的次级（生产性）投入。除关于服务贸易协定（STAs）形成的假设外，本文还提出了关于单边服务供给严格性——即普遍服务贸易限制性——的假设。例如，其中一个假设认为服务贸易限制性具有内生性，并与经济基本面保持一致。另一假设表明，当潜在伙伴国的单边服务贸易限制水平与本国越接近时，该国参与服务贸易协定的可能性越高。这些假设均得到了数据支持。,Services trade agreements; Services trade restrictiveness; Preferential trade liberalization; Services trade; Economic determinants of trade liberalization,2018-07-01

Bechtel,"Citizens' concerns about (international) environmental protection standards are of increasing importance to governments in industrially advanced, high-regulating countries. In almost any proposal for a trade agreement, countries with low environmental regulation are required to introduce higher policy standards in exchange for high-regulating countries dismantling their trade barriers and granting access to their domestic markets. Low-regulating countries often act as required and introduce legislation aiming at reducing pollution. This leads to declaratory or de jure policy convergence. But not always is such legislative action associated with de facto or actual policy convergence, since policies are not always enforced. In order to analyze the strategic aspect of this potential ""slippage"", we set up a simple game-theoretic model with imperfect infomation. In the model, a high-regulating and a low-regulating country negotiate a bilateral free trade agreement with environmental provisions. We show how potential gains from trade, policy enforcement, and reputation costs, as well as domestic demands for environmental protection affect the occurrence of environmental policy convergence through conditional trade agreements. By that, this study advances our understanding of the relationship between bilateral trade and convergence of environmental policies.","公民对（国际）环境保护标准的关注对工业发达、监管严格国家的政府日益重要。几乎在任何贸易协定提案中，环境监管宽松的国家都被要求引入更高的政策标准，以换取高监管国家取消贸易壁垒并开放其国内市场。低监管国家通常会按要求采取行动，出台旨在减少污染的立法。这导致了宣言性或法律上的政策趋同。但此类立法行动并不总是与实际或事实上的政策趋同相关联，因为政策并不总是得到执行。为了分析这种潜在""政策落差""的战略层面，我们建立了一个简单的不完全信息博弈论模型。在该模型中，一个高监管国家和一个低监管国家谈判达成包含环境条款的双边自由贸易协定。我们展示了贸易潜在收益、政策执行、声誉成本以及国内环保需求如何通过有条件贸易协定影响环境政策趋同的发生。由此，本研究深化了我们对双边贸易与环境政策趋同关系的理解。","Trade agreements, policy convergence, regulation",2007-08-13

Legal Standing and Remedies in WTO and International Arbitration,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1090892,Martin Molinuevo,"Disputes involving trade and investment in services are a rarity in the WTO. Up to now, the WTO dispute settlement mechanism (DSM) has addressed over 130 cases, of which a handful concerned trade and investment in services. It is possible to identify three relevant reasons that may explain, at least to some extent, the marginal attention that WTO dispute settlement has needed to pay to investment in services. This study attempts to explore two aspects of international disputes in investment in services. In a first part, it focuses on the international agreements granting standing for private parties in international dispute settlement procedure. With regard to WTO dispute settlement mechanism, the study attempts to explore how the disciplines of the Understanding on Dispute Settlement Procedures (DSU) together with the disciplines adopted in the GATS relate to foreign investors in services. It also addressed whether or not and how private parties are involved in WTO dispute settlement procedures. A second part of the study addresses the remedies Investor-State arbitration on the one hand and WTO dispute settlement mechanism on the other hand offers to resolve an investment-in-services dispute. Attention is drawn to the implications of these different remedies for foreign investors in services. Ultimately, the study attempts to answer the question of whether WTO dispute settlement procedures could become a valid alternative for investor-in-services - State dispute settlement.",涉及服务贸易与投资的争端在世贸组织中较为罕见。迄今为止，世贸组织争端解决机制（DSM）已处理130余起案件，其中仅少数涉及服务贸易与投资。至少在一定程度上，可归纳出三个相关原因来解释为何世贸争端解决机制对服务投资的关注度较低。本研究试图从两个维度探讨国际服务投资争端：第一部分聚焦于授权私人主体参与国际争端解决程序的国际协定。针对世贸争端解决机制，研究试图剖析《关于争端解决规则与程序的谅解》（DSU）的纪律框架与《服务贸易总协定》（GATS）的规则如何关联服务领域的外国投资者，并探讨私人主体是否及如何参与世贸争端解决程序。第二部分研究对比投资者-东道国仲裁与世贸争端解决机制在处理服务投资争端时提供的救济措施，重点关注这些差异救济对服务领域外国投资者的影响。最终，本研究试图回答：世贸争端解决程序能否成为服务投资者-东道国争端解决的有效替代方案。,"WTO, Trade and investment in services, Dispute Settlement Mechanism, Understanding on Dispute Settlement Procedures, GATS, private parties,remedies, investor-State arbitration, legal standing",2008-02-06

We suggest diplomacy as a model for reconfiguring regulatory institutions in response. Ambassadors for Regulatory Affairs who would be agents for all state regulatory agencies could be based in most large firms and small and medium enterprises that pose unusual regulatory risks. In rural towns, police would be trained as regulatory ambassadors. Just as a US Secretary of State can launch a “diplomatic surge” in Myanmar from 2009, so regulatory surges are possible in market sectors of high risk or high opportunity. We propose strategies of indirect reciprocity as a way in which reciprocity that is only episodic in these strategic ways can promote more general responsiveness. Indirect reciprocity is reciprocity that we do not personally experience, but learn from the experience of a culture. This means that so long as we sustain regulation as a relational as opposed to a purely technocratic process, indirect reciprocity might civilize regulatory compliance in an historical process informed by the theories of Elias and Putnam.","监管之所以困难，一个原因在于监管者与被监管者之间鲜有持续互动。我们建议以外交模式重构监管机构作为应对方案——可在多数具有特殊监管风险的大型企业及中小企业设立统管所有州级监管机构的""监管事务大使""，乡镇地区则可将警察培训为监管大使。正如美国国务卿2009年曾在缅甸发动""外交突击""，监管领域同样可在高风险或高机遇的市场板块实施""监管突击""。我们提出间接互惠策略，使这种仅存于特定场景的互惠行为能通过战略路径激发更广泛的响应机制。所谓间接互惠，即非亲身经历、而是从文化传承中习得的互惠模式。这意味着只要我们将监管维系为关系性（而非纯技术性）进程，在埃利亚斯与普特南理论观照的历史进程中，间接互惠或能促成更具文明特质的监管遵从。","diplomacy, indirect reciprocity, responsive regulation",2015-05-03

Kox,"This study analyses how domestic regulation affects trade in services through commercial presence and to what extent regulation, level and heterogeneity, has an impact on the choice of mode of servicing a foreign market for total services, financial services, transport, communication, computer, and other business services. Regulatory heterogeneity is found to have a relatively large impact on trade through commercial presence. The study also assesses what determines services suppliers’ choice of mode. Modes of supply are found to be complementary to various degrees. Commercial presence is more dominant the more similar a country pair is as far as regulation and business environment are concerned and countries sharing a common language are more likely to trade through commercial presence. For some sectors it is found that the disadvantage of remoteness is amplified by strict regulation. In most services sectors trade liberalisation generates meaningful market access only if commercial presence is allowed. Furthermore, absence of explicit barriers to trade and investment is not necessarily sufficient to attract foreign investors.",本研究分析了国内监管如何通过商业存在影响服务贸易，以及监管水平与差异性在多大程度上影响企业选择进入外国市场的模式，涵盖整体服务业、金融服务、运输、通信、计算机及其他商业服务领域。研究发现监管差异性对商业存在形式的贸易具有较大影响。研究同时评估了服务提供商选择市场进入模式的决定因素，发现不同供应模式之间存在不同程度的互补性。当国家间监管环境和商业环境越相似时，商业存在模式就越占主导地位；共享共同语言的国家也更倾向于通过商业存在进行贸易。某些行业数据显示，严格监管会放大地理距离带来的劣势。在多数服务领域，只有允许商业存在时，贸易自由化才能真正实现有意义的市场准入。此外，单纯消除显性贸易和投资壁垒并不足以吸引外国投资者。,"trade in services, regulatory reform, regulatory harmonization, modes of supply",2016-11-18

The Case ofTradeUnion Rights Violations by Indonesian Sports Shoe Manufacturers,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2315956,Tim Connor,"This article analyses the capacity of global non-state networks of civil society actors to effectively supplement weak state regulation in reducing human rights abuse by multi-national companies (MNCs). The effectiveness of NGOs used as part of a network of control finds support both in the radical criminological literature as well as those explicitly advocating for a networked regulatory approach. This case study of the Indonesian sport shoe industry demonstrates that networked regulation has had a positive short to medium-term impact on respect for trade union rights among some manufacturers producing for Western MNCs, but inconsistent approaches by the MNCs and ongoing resistance by the manufacturers has made this influence difficult to sustain. Critically, the Indonesian state emerges as a powerful and primarily — but far from completely — complicit set of actors: applying criminal sanctions for trade union rights violations but failing to enforce them, and influencing networked regulation in complex, contingent ways. Our cases suggest both that advocates and practitioners of networked regulation need to find more effective ways to respond to the corporate drive to maximize profit and that networked regulation’s long-term usefulness will likely depend on the extent to which it draws from and operates to strengthen progressive regulatory elements within Asian states.",本文分析了全球公民社会行为者组成的非国家网络在补充薄弱的国家监管、减少跨国公司侵犯人权行为方面的能力。将非政府组织作为监管网络的一部分，其有效性在激进犯罪学文献及明确倡导网络化监管方法的论述中均得到支持。通过对印尼运动鞋产业的案例研究可见，网络化监管对部分为西方跨国公司代工的制造商尊重工会权利产生了中短期积极影响，但跨国公司的不一致策略及制造商的持续抵制使得这种影响难以持续。关键在于，印尼政府作为一股强大且主要（但远非完全）共谋的力量：对侵犯工会权利行为实施刑事制裁却未执行，并以复杂多变的方式影响着网络化监管。我们的案例表明，网络化监管的倡导者和实践者需找到更有效方式应对企业追逐利润最大化的驱动，且该监管模式的长期效用很可能取决于其能否汲取并强化亚洲国家内部的进步监管要素。,"networked regulation, multi-stakeholder initiatives, employment law, corporate social responsibility, trade union rights, Asian criminology, supply chain, Indonesia, sweatshops, workers rights, labor rights, Nike, Adidas, Reebok",2013-08-26

Does the trade regime’s legal and institutional program, spanning over three-quarters of a century, require replacement? At a moment of inflection in international trade relations, this Article delves into the past, contending that conventional thinking about the laws and institutions of trade, rather than the laws and institutions themselves, imposes the biggest constraints on international economic cooperation. It posits that international trade regulation has been conceptualized around the binaries of “liberalized versus restricted trade” and “free trade versus protectionism” and that a new vocabulary is needed to navigate the current crisis. The Article begins by weaving together the dominant historical narratives of the trading system to portray the ways in which dominant accounts have been tethered to these two binaries, and the extent to which this impulse is distinctly Anglocentric. It then dismantles this overly limited view by offering an alternative historical account of the trade regime that transcends these distinctions and the Anglosphere. By comparing the two accounts, the Article reveals why the dominant disciplinary binaries are empty and why overcoming the Anglocentric bias is pivotal to reimagining international trade regulation.","2023年，多边贸易体系在深陷最严峻危机之际迎来了成立七十五周年纪念。如何化解这场危机？历经四分之三个世纪的贸易体系法律与制度框架是否需要彻底革新？值此国际贸易关系转折之际，本文追溯历史脉络，指出制约国际经济合作的最大障碍并非贸易法律与制度本身，而是人们对它们的传统认知。文章认为现行国际贸易规则始终围绕""开放贸易与限制贸易""""自由贸易与保护主义""二元对立构建，要破解当前困局必须建立全新话语体系。本文首先梳理贸易体系的主流历史叙事，揭示这些论述如何被束缚于二元对立框架，以及这种思维模式鲜明的盎格鲁中心主义特征；继而通过构建超越二元对立与英语世界视角的替代性历史叙事，解构这种狭隘认知。通过双重叙事的对比分析，本文阐明为何主流学科二元论已丧失解释力，以及突破盎格鲁中心主义偏见对重构国际贸易规则体系的关键意义。","international trade, international law, WTO, history, politics, law and political economy",2024-04-18

In a small open economy with exogenous policy, we first explain how private mitigation results in an unequal distribution of the health consequences of pollution in a manner consistent with epidemiologic studies, and consequently how the benefits and costs of trade in dirty goods interact with choices concerning private mitigation to polarize the interests of citizens concerning environmental stringency. The economy is then embedded in a broader political economy setting, and simulated to investigate the role of private mitigation in the determination of policy choices. We show that when citizens can effectively choose between costly collective and costly private alternatives for pollution control, the same polarization of interests underlies equilibrium policy choices concerning environmental regulation and trade openness in democratic and autocratic regimes.",认识到个体在私下减轻污染后果的能力差异，对于理解环境监管和污染商品贸易的需求至关重要，同时也对分析这些需求如何影响均衡政策选择具有关键意义。在一个政策外生的小型开放经济体中，我们首先阐释了私人缓解行为如何以符合流行病学研究的方式导致污染健康影响的非均衡分布，进而说明污染商品贸易的收益与成本如何与私人缓解选择相互作用，最终使公民在环境严格性议题上形成两极分化的利益诉求。随后将该经济体置于更广阔的政治经济背景下进行模拟，以探究私人缓解在政策制定中的作用。研究表明：当公民能够在成本高昂的集体治理与私人治理方案之间进行有效选择时，利益分化现象同样构成民主与专制政体下环境规制和贸易开放度均衡政策选择的基础。,"Environmental regulation, Private mitigation, Trade; Dirty Goods, Individual Welfare, Health, Democracy, Representation Theorem",2008-08-18
trade regulation,Environmental Technology Innovation and GreenTradein OECD Countries: The Moderating Role of EnvironmentalRegulationand Green Financial Policy,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4942189,yabin zhang,"International institutions and governments have recognised the significance of green trade in promoting environmental protection and fostering low-carbon growth. However, countries have not yet achieved a definitive comprehension of how to accelerate the shift to green products and green trade. Therefore, this study explores the impact of environmental technology innovation (ETI) on green trade by using a panel sample of 32 OECD nations from 2003 to 2021. Additionally, it examines whether this relationship is moderated by environmental regulation and green financial policy. Various statistical models were employed to test these relationships, including pooled ordinary least squares (OLS), two-way fixed effect, random effect, and fixed effect models. According to these models, the findings indicate that corporations’ ETI behaviour has been found to enhance the development of green trade. Moreover, this impact is moderated by environmental regulation; as environmental regulation gets more stringent, the contribution of ETI to green trade becomes more significant. Furthermore, green financial policy effectively regulates the connection between ETI and green trade. By providing corporations with dedicated funds for green projects, they are incentivised to engage in environmental innovation, hence enhancing the impact of ETI on green trade. Lastly, this study provides policy recommendations to expedite the shift towards green products and green trade, specifically focussing on developing countries.",国际机构和各国政府已认识到绿色贸易在促进环境保护和推动低碳增长方面的重要性。然而，各国对于如何加速向绿色产品和绿色贸易转型尚未形成明确共识。为此，本研究基于2003至2021年32个经合组织国家的面板数据，探讨了环境技术创新（ETI）对绿色贸易的影响，并检验了环境规制与绿色金融政策是否调节这种关系。研究采用混合最小二乘法、双向固定效应、随机效应和固定效应等多种统计模型进行验证。结果表明：企业的环境技术创新行为能有效促进绿色贸易发展；环境规制具有正向调节作用，随着环境监管趋严，ETI对绿色贸易的促进作用更加显著；绿色金融政策通过为企业提供环保项目专项资金，激励其开展环境创新，从而强化ETI对绿色贸易的积极影响。最后，本研究特别针对发展中国家提出了加速绿色转型的政策建议。,"Environmental technology innovation, Green trade, Environmental Regulation, Green financial policy",2024-08-31

Within the time frame of January 2020 to November 2023 that we analyze, digital trade negotiations have increased in preferential trade agreements (PTAs) significantly, and there has been a sharp rise in the negotiation of new types of treaties, known as ‘Digital Economy Agreements’. Beyond the critical advances in substantive rulemaking, we observe non-traditional actors stepping into the gap left by the shifting interest of traditional rule-makers to craft rules that best fit their policy priorities. Additionally, we see a broadening of topics beyond conventional digital trade matters, underscored by commitments of limited legal enforceability. The TAPED dataset has been updated to reflect these recent developments, emphasizing the importance of regular reviews to stay current and accurately inform research and policymaking in the area of digital trade regulation.","本文基于《电子商务与数据贸易协定条款》（TAPED）数据集提供的洞见，探讨并梳理了数字贸易监管领域的最新进展。在我们分析的2020年1月至2023年11月期间，优惠贸易协定（PTAs）中的数字贸易谈判显著增加，且新型条约""数字经济协定""的谈判数量急剧上升。除实质性规则制定的关键进展外，我们观察到非传统行为体正填补传统规则制定者因转移关注点而留下的空白，以制定最符合其政策优先级的规则。此外，数字贸易议题范围已超越传统领域，其标志是法律约束力有限的承诺条款增多。TAPED数据集已更新以反映这些新动态，突显定期审查对于保持时效性、准确支撑数字贸易监管领域研究与政策制定的重要性。","digital trade, e-commerce, data flows, preferential trade agreements, digital economy agreements, TAPED",2023-12-04
trade regulation,"Labour Migration,Tradeand Investment: From Fragmentation to Coherence",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2691420,Thomas Cottier,"Trade, investment and migration are strongly intertwined, being three key factors in international production. Yet, law and regulation of the three has remained highly fragmented. Trade is regulated by the WTO on the multilateral level, and through preferential trade agreements on the regional and bilateral levels – it is fragmented and complex in its own right. Investment, on the other hand, is mainly regulated through bilateral investment treaties with no strong links to the regulation of trade or migration. And, finally, migration is regulated by a web of different international, regional and bilateral agreements which focus on a variety of different aspects of migration ranging from humanitarian to economic. The problems of institutional fragmentation in international law are well-known. There is no organizational forum for coherent strategy-making on the multilateral level covering all three areas. Normative regulations may thus contradict each other. Trade regulation may bring about liberalization of access for service providers, but eventually faces problems in recruiting the best people from abroad. Investors may withdraw investment without being liable and responsible for disruptions to labour and to the livelihood and infrastructure of towns and communes affected by disinvestment. Finally, migration policies do not seem to create a significant impact as long as trade policies and investment policies are not working in a way that is conducive to reducing migration pressure, as trade and investment are simply more powerful on the regulatory level than migration. This paper addresses the question as to how fragmentation of the three fields could be remedied and greater coherence between these three areas of factor allocation in international economic relations and law could be achieved. It shows that migration regulation on the international level is lagging behind that of trade and investment. Stronger coordination and consideration of migration in trade and investment policy, and stronger international cooperation in migration, will provide the foundations for a coherent international architecture in the field.",贸易、投资与移民紧密交织，是国际生产的三大核心要素。然而三者的法律规制仍高度割裂——贸易由世贸组织负责多边层面协调，通过区域及双边优惠贸易协定实施，其规则体系本就呈现碎片化与复杂性；投资则主要依靠双边投资条约规范，与贸易或移民规制缺乏紧密联系；而移民政策受制于各类国际、区域及双边协议构成的网络，这些协议关注从人道主义到经济层面的多元议题。国际法中的制度碎片化问题众所周知：目前缺乏覆盖三大领域的多边战略协调组织平台，导致规范条款可能相互冲突。贸易规则可能推动服务提供者的市场准入自由化，却最终难以从海外招募顶尖人才；投资者撤资时无需对劳工权益受损、受撤资影响的城镇民生及基础设施破坏承担责任；只要贸易与投资政策未能有效缓解移民压力，移民政策就难以发挥实质作用，因为前两者在规制层面远比移民更具影响力。本文旨在探讨如何弥合三大领域的制度裂痕，实现国际经济关系与法律中生产要素配置的协同一致，指出国际移民规制远落后于贸易与投资领域。加强贸易投资政策对移民因素的统筹考量，深化移民领域的国际合作，将为构建协调统一的国际治理架构奠定基础。,"Labour Migration, Investment, Trade, Free Trade Agreements, WTO, Regulatory Coherence, Economic Development",2015-11-24
trade barriers,Opportunities for Cooperation in Removing ProhibitiveTradeBarriers,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3071449,David DeRemer,"Much potential for trade liberalization exists in industries and markets with trade barriers that are prohibitive for all or many firms. In standard political economic theories of trade policy, observed prohibitive barriers must be globally optimal according to both individual and joint government preferences, leaving no possibility for a trade agreement. This chapter shows that in a standard imperfectly competitive model, observed prohibitive barriers may be optimal according to individual government preferences but not joint government preferences, so that a trade agreement would be valuable. Theory can then further identify market characteristics for which liberalization is most likely to be feasible. To illustrate, we consider a two-country model with Cournot firms in segmented markets. For plausible ranges of political weights on firm profits, there is a role for a trade agreement in eliminating prohibitive trade barriers. We then consider how the potential for cooperation varies with trade costs, Ricardian technological differences, competition, and firm heterogeneity. The implications of these results are discussed for negotiations involving developing countries, for whom prohibitive trade barriers remain important.",在所有或多数企业面临禁止性贸易壁垒的行业和市场，贸易自由化潜力巨大。根据标准贸易政策的政治经济学理论，观察到的禁止性壁垒必须符合各国政府单独及共同的全局最优偏好，这使得贸易协定失去存在基础。本章研究表明，在标准不完全竞争模型中，禁止性壁垒可能仅符合单个政府的最优偏好，却违背联合政府的最优偏好，此时贸易协定将产生价值。理论框架还能进一步识别最可能实现自由化的市场特征。为此，我们构建了一个包含市场分割条件下古诺企业的两国模型：在企业利润政治权重处于合理区间时，消除禁止性贸易壁垒的协定具有现实意义。随后我们考察了合作潜力如何随贸易成本、李嘉图技术差异、市场竞争及企业异质性而变化。这些结论对发展中国家参与的贸易谈判具有启示意义——禁止性贸易壁垒在这些国家仍普遍存在。,"WTO, prohibitive trade barriers, strategic trade",2017-11-20
trade barriers,Restrictiveness Index as a Measure ofBarriersin InternationalTradein Services,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2773789,Andzelika Kuznar,"The goal of the paper is to develop the method for measuring barriers to trade in services and apply it to determine the degree of restrictiveness of access to the Polish market in selected service industries. In the case of services - more frequently than for tangible goods - barriers take the form of government regulations determining the market entry / establishment of a business or the way of running the business. These regulations may discriminate against foreign entities, or not. This can be checked on the basis of questionnaires or the analysis of government documents (laws, regulations) and industry regulations (e.g. codes of professional ethics). Restrictions are given a numerical value and weight. In this way, restrictiveness index is  constructed, measuring access to the service industry. Construction of several such indices for different groups of services allows a comparison of the degree of restrictiveness of foreign access to the Polish market with respect to domestic services and service providers as well as between different industries. This is a base for further studies of the possible results of removing the barriers. The paper reviews the literature on barriers to trade in services and how they are measured. The rationale for using the index of restrictiveness as a measure of barriers in professional services is given and such index is built in other to assess the restrictiveness of the access to market in four sectors of professional services: accountancy, legal, architectural and engineering services.",本文旨在开发一种衡量服务贸易壁垒的方法，并运用该方法测定波兰部分服务行业市场准入的限制程度。与有形商品相比，服务贸易壁垒更常表现为政府规制，这些规制决定着市场准入/商业实体的设立或运营方式。此类规制可能歧视外国实体，也可能一视同仁。可通过问卷调查或分析政府文件（法律、法规）及行业规范（如职业道德准则）进行验证。研究对各项限制措施赋予数值和权重，由此构建出衡量服务业准入程度的限制性指数。通过为不同服务类别编制多个此类指数，既能比较波兰市场对国内外服务及服务提供商的准入限制差异，也能进行跨行业限制程度对比。这为后续研究消除壁垒可能产生的效果奠定了基础。本文综述了服务贸易壁垒及其量化方法的相关文献，阐明了采用限制性指数作为专业服务壁垒衡量工具的理论依据，并构建该指数以评估会计、法律、建筑和工程四大专业服务领域的市场准入限制程度。,"trade in services, Poland, trade barriers, restrictiveness index",2016-05-02

I discipline the model using rich micro data on price dispersion as well as foreign and domestic trade flows at the Indian state level. I find that (1) state-based price data predict internal trade flows well; (2) internal trade barriers make up 40% of the total trade cost on average, but vary substantially by state depending on the distance to the closest port; and (3) the welfare impacts of domestic integration are substantial: reducing trade barriers across states to the U.S. level increases welfare by more (13%) than fully eliminating international import barriers (7%).",本文量化了国内与国际贸易壁垒的规模，并评估了其对贸易和福利的影响。我构建了一个多部门定量国际贸易模型，该模型采用非位似偏好设定，涵盖各邦在国内与国际层面的贸易活动。通过运用印度邦级层面丰富的价格离散数据及国内外贸易流数据，我对模型进行了校准。研究发现：（1）基于各邦的价格数据能有效预测国内贸易流；（2）国内贸易壁垒平均占总贸易成本的40%，但各邦差异显著，其比重与距最近港口的距离密切相关；（3）国内一体化带来的福利效应显著：将各邦间贸易壁垒降至美国水平所产生的福利提升（13%）远超完全消除国际进口壁垒的效果（7%）。,"Internal Trade Barriers, External Trade Barriers, Welfare, India",2017-01-03

There are many barrier combinations that deliver price equalization, but each combination implies a different volume of trade. We demonstrate this first theoretically in a simple two-country model and then quantitatively for the case of capital goods trade in a multi-country model. To be quantitatively consistent with the observed capital goods trade flows across countries, our model implies that trade barriers must be large, yet our model delivers capital goods prices that are similar across countries. The absence of barriers to trade in capital goods delivers price equalization in capital goods but cannot reproduce the observed trade flows.",本文证明价格均等化并不意味着贸易壁垒为零。存在多种能实现价格均等化的壁垒组合，但每种组合对应着不同的贸易量。我们首先通过一个简单的两国模型进行理论阐述，随后在多国模型中对资本品贸易案例进行量化分析。为与观察到的跨国资本品贸易流量保持定量一致，模型显示贸易壁垒必须足够大——尽管该模型下各国资本品价格仍保持相近。若完全取消资本品贸易壁垒，虽可实现价格均等化，却无法复现实际观测到的贸易流量。,"Purchasing Power Parity, Capital Goods Prices, Bilateral Trade Flows, Trade Barriers",2014-05-20

I obtain theoretically consistent empirical measures for these characteristics by estimating the structural parameters of a model of international trade that features variable marginal production costs and differences in product appeal. The empirical analysis suggests that changes in expenditures, trade barriers, and number of varieties explain, respectively, about 14, 12, and 5 percent of the growth of trade flows. Most of the remaining variation is explained by changes in product appeal. Consistent with the Linder hypothesis, the measures of product appeal are positively correlated with exporter productivity and trading partners’ income similarity. Counterfactual analysis shows that the welfare gains associated with reasonable increases in product appeal are of the same order of magnitude as the gains associated with a complete removal of policy barriers.",本文中，我将分解后的双边贸易流量增长归因于总支出变化、品种数量变化、贸易成本变化、产品吸引力变化、生产成本变化及多边阻力项的贡献。通过估算一个具有可变边际生产成本和产品吸引力差异特征的国际贸易模型的结构参数，我获得了这些特征在理论上一致的经验测度。实证分析表明，支出变化、贸易壁垒变化和品种数量变化分别解释了贸易流量增长的约14%、12%和5%。其余大部分变异由产品吸引力变化解释。与林德假说一致，产品吸引力测度与出口国生产率及贸易伙伴间收入相似度呈正相关。反事实分析显示，产品吸引力合理提升带来的福利收益与完全消除政策壁垒所产生的收益处于同一数量级。,"International Trade, Product Appeal, Product Differentiation, Trade Barriers, Trade Growth",2017-08-12
trade barriers,EliminatingTradeBarriersThrough PreferentialTradeAgreements: Perspectives from South Asia,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3200078,Divesh Kaul,"Since time immemorial, trade has substantially influenced human life. Trade enthused  intercontinental movements of the Asiatic people, Phoenicians, Egyptians, and other ancient  societies. From the ancient “Silk Route” to today’s electronic “Silk Road,” rise in intercontinental  trade has coincided with the increase in globalization’s pace.3 Scholars mark the evolution of the  modern trade regime primarily by three eras: first, the introduction of mutually binding tariff  reductions; second, the institutionalization of international trade; and third, the expansion of  traditional trade obligations to include various new requirements, including a more indirect  relationship to trade, and streamlined and effective dispute resolution.  Several important elements, such as non-discrimination and multilateralism, characterize  global trade governance. Yet it is not a static phenomenon and is certainly not limited to the  principles of Most-Favored Nation and National Treatment, or reducing tariff barriers.  Multilateralism remains an important stimulant in addressing contemporary challenges, such as  reducing trade barriers as a means to stem mercantilist tendencies and further global trade  governance. Preferential trade agreements have added a desirable wing to competitive trade liberalization  through which more than 50% of today’s international trade transpires. Notably, the multilevel  global trade governance under the auspices of WTO experienced a gradual increase in its  complexity as it evolved. In contrast, deeper and easier integration has been witnessed at regional  levels. For example, South Asian countries experimented with the South Asian Association for  Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to create regional ripples that parallel bilateral and multilateral  currents in an effort to further harness the fruits of participatory governance and trade  liberalization. South Asia houses a population of roughly 1.67 billion people, including 40% of the  world’s poor. Yet, it remains one of the least integrated regions. The conundrums of trade barriers  have become vital in global trade governance.

trade barriers,Introduction to 'The Great Recession and Import Protection: The Role of TemporaryTradeBarriers',https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1890700,Chad P. Bown,"The Great Recession of 2008-9 imposed a negative shock on the global economy comparable to the 1930s Great Depression. Nevertheless, one fundamental distinction between the Great Depression and the Great Recession is that the 2008-9 global economic contraction did not result in a massive wave of new protectionism. Comprehending why the 2008-9 economic crisis failed to trigger a downward spiral of beggar-thy-neighbour policies is fundamental to understanding the resilience of the global economy and the 21st century multilateral trading system. While there was not a large scale resort to protectionism, the facts simply do not support the idea that countries did not adjust their trade policies during this period. Policies like antidumping, safeguards, and countervailing duties – what this volume refers to collectively as temporary trade barriers (TTBs) – played an important and perhaps even critical role during the 2008-9 crisis. This Introduction provides a summary and timeline of events in the Great Recession, including its macroeconomic and trade impacts, the uncertainty over trade policy in 2008-9, and the response to calls for additional monitoring of trade policy. In particular, this Introductions highlights the real time monitoring efforts of the World Bank’s Global Antidumping Database and subsequent Temporary Trade Barriers Database. These efforts both addressed some of the immediate concern about the unknown scale of protectionism taking place in 2008-9 and revealed a lack of informational preparedness that has ultimately spurred this volume’s research. The Introduction then summarizes new research on how the eleven economies of focus in this volume - four high-income and seven emerging – collectively increased by 25% the imported products that they subject to TTB import protection during the crisis. Nevertheless, there is substantial heterogeneity to this result across countries – e.g., developing countries used TTBs to cover 39% more imported products by the end of 2009 compared to 2007, whereas recession-ravaged high-income economies surprisingly increased their coverage by only 4%. Finally, the Introduction summarizes how the volume's authors apply a new methodological approach, as well as detailed, product-level data on TTBs, trade flows, and other trade policies to better interpret these crisis-era changes in historical context.","2008-2009年大衰退对全球经济造成的负面冲击堪比1930年代大萧条。然而大萧条与大衰退的根本区别在于，2008-2009年全球经济萎缩并未引发新保护主义的滔天巨浪。理解为何2008-2009年经济危机未能诱发""以邻为壑""政策的恶性循环，对于把握全球经济与21世纪多边贸易体系的韧性至关重要。虽然各国未大规模转向保护主义，但事实表明贸易政策在此期间确实有所调整。反倾销、保障措施和反补贴税——本书统称为临时贸易壁垒（TTBs）——在2008-2009年危机中发挥了重要甚至关键作用。本绪论概述了大衰退期间的事件脉络，包括宏观经济与贸易影响、2008-2009年贸易政策的不确定性，以及对加强贸易政策监测呼吁的响应。特别强调了世界银行全球反倾销数据库及后续临时贸易壁垒数据库的实时监测工作，这些举措既缓解了人们对2008-2009年保护主义未知规模的担忧，也暴露出信息准备不足的问题，最终催生了本书的研究。绪论总结了关于本书研究的11个经济体（4个高收入国家和7个新兴国家）如何在危机期间将受TTB进口保护的进口产品总量增加25%的新发现，但各国存在显著差异——例如发展中国家到2009年底受TTB保护的进口产品较2007年增加39%，而遭受衰退重创的高收入经济体仅增加4%。最后，绪论概述了作者们如何运用新方法论及TTBs、贸易流量等产品级数据，在历史背景下解读这些危机时期的政策变化。","Great Recession, import protection, protectionism, temporary trade barriers, antidumping, safeguards, countervailing duties, WTO, G20, United States, European Union, Canada, South Korea, China, India, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Turkey, South Africa",2011-07-21

In this paper, I relax this assumption, developing a framework in which to analyze the role of interactions among countries' patterns of comparative advantage in determining the aggregate effects of trade barriers. My model preserves much of the tractability of standard aggregate quantitative trade models while allowing for the effects of any pattern of comparative advantage, across many products and countries, to be taken into account.  After fitting my model to product-level trade data, I find that the composition of trade flows is quantitatively important in determining the welfare gains from trade and the aggregate effects of trade barriers.  A key finding is that the welfare gains from trade tend to be larger and more skewed in favor of low-income countries than an aggregate model would suggest.",一类广泛应用的定量贸易模型隐含地假设比较优势模式采取特定形式，使其对贸易壁垒在总体贸易流量和福利上的影响不产生作用。本文中，我放宽了这一假设，构建了一个分析框架，用以研究各国比较优势模式间的相互作用如何决定贸易壁垒的总体影响。该模型在保持标准总体定量贸易模型大部分可操作性的同时，能够综合考虑跨越多产品、多国家的任意比较优势模式的影响。将模型与产品级贸易数据拟合后，我发现贸易流量的构成在决定贸易带来的福利收益和贸易壁垒的总体影响方面具有重要的量化意义。一个关键发现是：与总体模型所暗示的相比，贸易带来的福利收益往往更大，且更倾向于使低收入国家受益。,"international trade, welfare, composition, product level, comparative advantage, trade barriers, gravity, trade cost elasticity, developing countries",2015-10-16

The model is calibrated to match the world GDP distribution, the merchandise trade and technology diffusion shares of GDP, and real GDP per capita for a sample of 31 countries. Data on international trade in royalties, license fees, and information intensive services are used as proxies for international technology diffusion. There are three key findings. First, the welfare gains from removing diffusion barriers are 4-60% across countries, generally larger than the gains from removing trade costs (8-40%). The main reason is that diffusion has a larger impact on the nontradable sector due to the substitutability between trade and diffusion in the tradable sector. Another reason is that diffusion barriers are generally larger than trade costs. Second, removing trade costs and diffusion barriers has little impact on reducing the dispersion of real GDP per capita (measured by Gini index) across countries. Compared to the benchmark, free diffusion decreases the Gini by 4%, and free trade decreases the Gini by 2%. Third, removing diffusion barriers increases trade, which indicates that diffusion may enhance trade.",本文评估了消除贸易成本与技术扩散壁垒对福利的影响，以及由此引发的跨国GDP分布变化。该研究将Alvarez和Lucas（2007）的多国李嘉图贸易模型扩展至包含存在扩散壁垒的技术扩散，其核心特征是某些国家通过技术扩散出口采用外国技术生产的产品。模型校准参照31个样本国的全球GDP分布、商品贸易与技术扩散占GDP比重及人均实际GDP数据，并以特许权使用费、许可费和信息密集型服务的国际贸易数据作为国际技术扩散的代理指标。主要发现有三：首先，消除扩散壁垒带来的福利收益介于4%-60%之间，普遍高于消除贸易成本的收益（8%-40%），主因在于扩散对非贸易部门影响更大（因贸易与扩散在贸易部门存在替代性），且扩散壁垒通常高于贸易成本；其次，消除贸易成本与扩散壁垒对降低国家间人均实际GDP离散度（基尼系数衡量）作用有限——相比基准值，自由扩散使基尼系数下降4%，自由贸易仅降低2%；最后，消除扩散壁垒会促进贸易增长，表明技术扩散可能助推贸易发展。,"international trade, technology diffusion, welfare gains, diffusion barriers, income distribution",2012-06-12
trade barriers,"Digitization, RegulatoryBarriersand Sustainable Development",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4424470,Mira Burri,"The digital economy and digitization in general have long been touted as environmentally sustainable alternatives to physical commercial activity. The truth is more nuanced than that. Nevertheless, a broader framing of sustainable development, as outlined in the UN Sustainable Development Goals, indicates that sustainability goes beyond just environmental considerations and encompasses social and economic dimensions as well. The digital economy has the advantage of relatively low barriers to entry and reduced costs, which can lead to enhanced economic and social inclusion. However, the proliferation of digital protectionism through increasing regulatory barriers threaten the envisioned sustainable development dividends of digitization. In this paper, we identify and analyze these regulatory barriers, map and propose potential solutions, and argue that despite the decline in the World Trade Organization’s formal negotiating power, it can still play a crucial role in convening and contextualizing international developments to ensure that the digital economy is leveraged optimally as a tool for sustainable development.",数字经济及整体数字化进程长期被视为实体商业活动的环保可持续替代方案。但实际情况比这更为复杂。不过，根据联合国可持续发展目标提出的更广泛框架，可持续性不仅涉及环境因素，还包含社会与经济维度。数字经济具有准入门槛相对较低、成本优势明显的特点，有助于促进经济和社会包容性。然而，日益增长的监管壁垒所导致的数字保护主义蔓延，正威胁着数字化带来的预期可持续发展红利。本文通过识别分析这些监管壁垒，规划并提出潜在解决方案，同时论证尽管世界贸易组织正式谈判能力有所下降，它仍能在召集国际动态和构建发展语境方面发挥关键作用，以确保数字经济作为可持续发展工具得到最优利用。,"digital trade, digitization, sustainable development, regulatory barriers, trade agreements, international cooperation, World Trade Organization",2023-05-02

In this paper, I show that this assumption is inconsistent with patterns present in the product-level trade data and develop a framework in which to analyze the role of interactions among countries' patterns of comparative advantage in determining the aggregate effects of trade barriers. The model preserves much of the tractability of standard aggregate quantitative trade models while allowing for the effects of any pattern of comparative advantage, across many products and countries, to be taken into account. After fitting the model to product-level trade data, I find that the composition of trade flows is quantitatively important in determining the welfare gains from trade and the aggregate effects of changes in trade barriers. A key finding is that the welfare gains from trade tend to be larger and more skewed toward low-income countries than an aggregate model would suggest.",一类广泛应用的定量贸易模型隐含假设比较优势模式呈现特定形式，使其对贸易壁垒在总体贸易流量和福利上的影响不产生作用。本文论证该假设与产品层面贸易数据中的实际模式不符，并构建了一个分析框架，用以研究各国比较优势模式间的相互作用如何决定贸易壁垒的总体影响。该模型在保持标准总体定量贸易模型可操作性的同时，能够纳入多产品、多国家间任意比较优势模式的影响效应。将模型与产品层面贸易数据拟合后，研究发现贸易流量的构成对衡量贸易福利收益及贸易壁垒变化的总体影响具有重要量化意义。核心结论表明：与实际贸易数据测算结果相比，仅使用总体模型会系统性低估贸易带来的福利收益，且该收益在低收入国家的分布被显著低估。,"International Trade, Composition, Comparative Advantage, Trade Barriers, Welfare, Gravity, Income Differences, Elasticity of Substitution",2014-08-12

Bown,"This chapter identifies a number of stylized facts regarding the evolving pattern of import protection associated with the global economic crisis of 2008-2009, with a special focus on developing countries. While the major G-20 member economies of the international trading system largely refrained from using protectionist instruments that had been used during earlier eras of crisis - such as across-the-board increases in applied tariffs and the imposition of new quantitative restrictions - much of the new protectionism came in the form of potentially WTO-consistent use of temporary trade barriers such as antidumping, countervailing duties, and safeguards. Nevertheless, the incidence of new trade barriers that did take place during the crisis was developing economy-centric in nature: it was disproportionately imposed by developing economies on developing economy exporters with the potential to impact much South-South trade. Finally, the chapter explores policy implications for developing countries in the post-global economic crisis, rules-based trading system.",本章揭示了与2008-2009年全球经济危机相关的进口保护模式演变的若干典型事实，尤其聚焦发展中国家。尽管国际贸易体系中主要的二十国集团成员经济体基本避免了使用过去危机时期采用的保护主义手段——如全面提高适用关税和实施新的数量限制——但新保护主义主要体现为可能符合世贸组织规则的反倾销、反补贴税和保障措施等临时性贸易壁垒的运用。然而，危机期间实际实施的新贸易壁垒具有以发展中经济体为中心的特征：发展中经济体不成比例地对发展中经济体出口商施加这些壁垒，可能对大量南南贸易造成影响。最后，本章探讨了基于规则的贸易体系在后全球经济危机时代对发展中国家的政策启示。,"Global economic crisis, protectionism, developing countries, temporary trade barriers, antidumping, countervailing duties, safeguards, OTRI, MA-OTRI",2011-08-02

We show that international sanctions against Iranian economy is a good example of trade barriers, therefore we apply this method to Iran data for recession of 2012-13.

trade barriers,Informal ExportBarriersand Poverty,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=610398,Guido G. Porto,"Porto investigates the poverty impacts of informal export barriers like transport costs, cumbersome customs practices, costly regulations, and bribes. He models these informal barriers as export taxes that distort the efficient allocation of resources. In low-income agricultural economies, this distortion lowers wages and household agricultural income, thereby leading to higher poverty. The author investigates the poverty impacts of improving export procedures in Moldova. This is a unique case study: poverty is widespread (half of the Moldovan population lives in poverty), the country is very open and relies on agricultural exports for growth, formal trade barriers are fairly liberalized, and informal export barriers are common and widespread. The author finds that improving export practices would benefit the average Moldovan household across the whole income distribution. For example, halving informal export barriers would cause poverty to decline from 48.3 percent of the population to between 43.3 and 45.5 percent, potentially lifting 100,000-180,000 individuals out of poverty.

trade barriers,India: The Use of TemporaryTradeBarriers,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1842484,Patricia Tovar,"While India did not use antidumping, safeguards, and countervailing measures (temporary trade barriers) prior to 1992, it subsequently came to become the WTO system’s dominant user of those policies. Using detailed product-level data from the World Banks’ Temporary Trade Barriers Database from 1992-2009, we first study India’s use of temporary trade barriers over time, and across products, sectors and targeted countries, to then establish changes in previous patterns that may have taken place during the global economic crisis of 2008-2009. We find that there has been an increase in the stock of products subject to antidumping measures during 1992-2009. Moreover, the percentage of tariff line products affected by an antidumping measure increased during the recent global recession, from 1.82% in 2007 to 4.03% in 2009, and the evidence suggests that such increase is larger than would be predicted by the observed pre-crisis trend. We also find a shift in the incidence of India’s antidumping policy towards China and other developing countries in recent years. Furthermore, another dimension along which India’s antidumping protection increased during 2008-9 was via the failure to remove policies that were imposed prior to the global economic crisis and were supposed to be terminated during the crisis under the five-year ‘Sunset Review’ limit. There was also an increase in India’s use of global safeguard investigations as well as China-specific safeguards during the global economic crisis. However, the process of tariff liberalisation continued during such period, and it is possible that India’s use of temporary trade barriers might have helped it move in that direction.","尽管印度在1992年前未曾动用反倾销、保障措施和反补贴措施（临时性贸易壁垒），但此后却成为世贸组织体系内这些政策的主要使用者。基于世界银行1992-2009年临时贸易壁垒数据库的详细产品级数据，我们首先研究了印度在不同时期、不同产品、行业及目标国实施临时贸易壁垒的情况，进而探究2008-2009年全球经济危机期间可能发生的模式变化。研究发现1992-2009年间印度实施反倾销措施的产品存量持续增长。受反倾销措施影响的税目产品比例在近期全球经济衰退期间显著上升，从2007年的1.82%增至2009年的4.03%，且证据表明该增幅远超危机前趋势的预期值。研究还发现近年来印度反倾销政策的实施对象转向中国及其他发展中国家。此外，2008-2009年间印度反倾销保护的强化还体现在：未按五年""日落复审""规定终止本应在危机期间撤销的既有措施。全球经济危机期间，印度还加大了对全球保障措施及针对中国特保措施的调查力度。但该时期的关税自由化进程仍在推进，临时贸易壁垒的使用或许为这一进程提供了助力。","India, WTO, Antidumping, Safeguards, Countervailing Measures",2011-05-16

trade barriers,Barriersto Prosperity - Developing Countries and the Need forTradeLiberalisation,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2182096,Sushil Mohan,"Non-tariff barriers are an important impediment to trade for less developed countries. Such barriers can be very high on both processed and unprocessed agricultural products. These barriers include: EU rules of origin and rules relating to traceability. The combination of these rules with preferential trade agreements which becomes more onerous as the degree of processing increases. Health and safety regulations. Labeling schemes such as fair trade and organic. Environmental standards, such as those relating to palm oil exports. Both export and import procedures imposed by developing countries themselves: for example, exporting in India involves 12 separate processes.      Non-tariff barriers need to be brought to the forefront of the trade debate if developing countries are to move into the export of higher value added products.      Currently, developing countries have a low share of exports of final processed products which normally have a higher value added than primary agricultural products. For example, developing countries account for 91 per cent of raw coffee exports but only 3 per cent of processed coffee exports.      This situation is frequently blamed on developed countries applying trade barriers and escalating tariffs on processed commodities.      However, there is little truth in this allegation, at least in relation to the important commodities of coffee, tea and cocoa. However, tariffs barriers do exist in relation to other commodities such as cotton, rice and so on.      Not only are tariff barriers close to zero on coffee, tea and cocoa, there is also very little tariff escalation  that is the level of tariffs on processed products is not significantly greater than the level of tariffs on unprocessed products. Japan is the only major exception to this general pattern.      On the other hand, tariff barriers between developing countries themselves can be very high. For example, tariffs on roasted coffee are 71 per cent in Mexico and 99 per cent in India. There is, however, little evidence of tariff escalation on trade between developing countries: tariffs are often very high on both processed and unprocessed agricultural products.      There may well be important tariff barriers with regard to higher degrees of processing of more complex products (such as chocolate). These are especially prevalent in product lines where there is competition between developed and under-developed countries or where developed countries produce some of the ingredients for these products (for example, milk and sugar for chocolate).      Non-tariff barriers are often home grown within developing countries themselves. The experience of trade reform suggests that the benefits from their removal will mainly flow to developing countries. Non-tariff barriers must therefore be a clear priority in future trade policy and in domestic policy making in poor countries.",非关税壁垒是欠发达国家贸易的重要障碍。这些壁垒对加工和未加工农产品都可能非常高。这些壁垒包括：欧盟原产地规则和可追溯性规定，这些规则与优惠贸易协定相结合，随着加工程度提高而变得更加繁重；健康安全法规；公平贸易和有机产品等标签体系；以及涉及棕榈油出口等环境标准。发展中国家自身实施的进出口程序也构成障碍，例如印度出口需经历12道独立流程。. . 若发展中国家要转向高附加值产品出口，就必须将非关税壁垒置于贸易谈判的核心位置。当前发展中国家在最终加工产品出口中占比很低，而这类产品通常比初级农产品具有更高附加值。例如发展中国家占全球生咖啡出口量的91%，但加工咖啡出口仅占3%。. . 这种情况常被归咎于发达国家设置贸易壁垒并对加工商品实施关税升级。但该指控基本不属实——至少对咖啡、茶叶和可可等重要商品而言。不过棉花、大米等其他商品确实存在关税壁垒。咖啡、茶叶和可可的关税壁垒近乎为零，且几乎不存在关税升级现象（即加工产品关税水平未显著高于未加工产品）。日本是这一普遍模式中唯一的重大例外。. . 另一方面，发展中国家之间的关税壁垒可能极高。例如烘焙咖啡关税在墨西哥达71%，在印度高达99%。但发展中国家间贸易中鲜见关税升级证据：无论加工还是未加工农产品，关税通常都处于极高水平。. . 对于复杂产品（如巧克力）的深加工环节，可能存在重大关税壁垒。这在发达国家与欠发达国家存在竞争的产品线，或发达国家生产部分原料（如巧克力的牛奶和糖）的领域尤为普遍。. . 非关税壁垒往往源于发展中国家内部。贸易改革经验表明，消除这些壁垒的主要受益者将是发展中国家。因此，非关税壁垒必须成为贫困国家未来贸易政策和国内决策的明确优先事项。,"barriers to prosperity, trade liberalisation, institute of economic affairs, Sushil Mohan",2012-11-30

Using the Temporary Trade Barriers Database (Bown 2010b), we determined that the stock of imported products subject to antidumping duties in Korea has increased moderately over time. During the financial crisis of 2008-9, there were a relatively small number of initiations; however, we conclude that the Korea Trade Commission was active in imposing AD duties during the financial crisis. We also conclude that AD measures have functioned as a substitute for tariff protection measures in Korea during this period and that the Korean use of AD measures is consistent with the theory put forth by Grossman and Helpman (1994) that politically organized sectors tended to receive more protection than unorganized ones. In addition, our analysis of the practical use of Korea’s determinants of dumping margins suggests that the KTC has more frequently used ‘facts available’ than any other discretionary practices during the global financial crisis.","本文研究了韩国在2008-9年全球金融危机前后对临时性贸易壁垒（主要是反倾销措施）的运用。基于临时贸易壁垒数据库（Bown 2010b）的分析显示，韩国征收反倾销税的进口产品存量随时间推移呈现温和增长。尽管2008-9年金融危机期间新发起的调查数量相对有限，但我们发现韩国贸易委员会在此期间积极实施了反倾销措施。研究还表明，反倾销措施在此阶段充当了韩国关税保护措施的替代工具，且韩国的反倾销实践符合Grossman和Helpman（1994）提出的理论——政治组织化行业往往比非组织化行业获得更多保护。此外，我们对韩国倾销幅度判定标准实际运用的分析表明，在全球金融危机期间，韩国贸易委员会使用""可获得事实""规则的频率显著高于其他自由裁量做法。","Temporary Trade Barriers, Antidumping Duties, South Korea",2011-05-15

trade barriers,Choked by Red Tape? The Political Economy of WastefulTradeBarriers,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3198135,Giovanni Maggi,"Red-tape barriers (RTBs) are an important source of trade costs, but have received little scholarly attention to date. Here we examine the economic-political determinants of RTBs and their effects on trade. Because of their wasteful nature, RTBs have very different implications from those of more traditional trade barriers. In particular, RTBs have important impacts on the extensive margin of trade, and respond in non-standard ways to changes in tariffs and natural trade costs. We argue that taking into account the endogenous response of RTBs is crucial for understanding the effects of tariff liberalization and globalization on trade and welfare.",繁文缛节壁垒（RTBs）是贸易成本的重要来源，但迄今为止鲜少获得学术界关注。本文研究了繁文缛节壁垒的经济政治决定因素及其对贸易的影响。由于其资源浪费特性，繁文缛节壁垒与传统贸易壁垒具有截然不同的经济内涵。具体而言，这类壁垒对贸易广延边际产生显著影响，并对关税和自然贸易成本的变化表现出非标准响应模式。我们认为，理解关税自由化与全球化对贸易及福利的影响时，必须充分考虑繁文缛节壁垒的内生性响应。,"International trade policy, Non-Tariff Measures, political economy, Red tape barriers",2018-06-18
trade barriers,Hidden Market AccessBarriersin China: India’s Exports in Electrical Machinery,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3575344,Kallummal Murali,India and China have significant bilateral trade flows leading to trade specialization in different product categories. The bilateral trade between these countries is clearly dominated by the Chinese exports. The trade figures show that the value of India’s import from China stood at USD 71.9 billion against its exports to China USD 12.4 billion. This paper evaluates the trade barriers faced by India in China’s market focusing mainly on electrical machinery sector. The empirical analysis shows that China has hidden trade barriers in electrical machinery sector by replacing the use of ad-valorem tariff with non-ad valorem tariff (AVE’s). This study will help India to address the issue of market access and demand removal of trade barriers in the electrical machinery sector while negotiating at the RCEP with China to address the issue of trade imbalance.,印度与中国拥有显著的双边贸易流动，导致双方在不同产品类别上形成专业化分工。两国间的贸易明显以中国出口为主导。数据显示，印度从中国进口额达719亿美元，而对华出口仅为124亿美元。本文重点评估印度在中国电力机械市场面临的贸易壁垒。实证分析表明，中国通过采用从量税替代从价税的方式，在电力机械领域设置了隐性贸易壁垒。本研究将助力印度在《区域全面经济伙伴关系协定》谈判中，就解决贸易失衡问题向中国提出市场准入诉求，并要求消除电力机械行业的贸易壁垒。,"RCEP Negotiations, Non-Ad-Valorem Tariff, Technical Barriers to Trade, Electrical Machinery, Time Series, China",2020-05-05
trade barriers,The (In)Compatibility of Direct SellingTradeBarrierswith EU Law: Before and After the Consumer Rights Directive,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2347507,Orsolya Tokaji-Nagy,"The direct selling retail channel is often abused by rogue trades which triggers Draconian responses from national legislators. As a result, the direct selling industry in the EU is restricted by a number divergent trade barriers. At the chore of the problem lies the conflict of interest between the liberalization of trade in respect of the direct selling industry and Member States' freedom to impose stringent regulations in order to favor consumers’ economic interests. The current paper assesses direct selling trade barriers' compatibility with European law, and in particular, the fundamental freedoms of the internal market and the relevant secondary law regulating consumer protection, fair trading law and the provision of services. Through the comparative analysis of the CJEU's jurisprudence concerning four direct selling trade barriers, it was found that the unworkable rigidity of the Keck formula has significantly hampered the Court's efforts to give clear rulings on the assessed cases, although curiously, in none of the four cases did the Court pronounce that direct selling trade barriers were in compliance with the free movement of goods principle. The Consumer Rights Directive is expected to bring about much needed clarity and legal certainty in respect to direct selling trade barriers. Complemented by the assessment of relevant provisions of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive and the Services Directive, it was concluded that as of the entry into force of the Consumer Rights Directive, the introduction or maintenance of direct selling trade barriers will no longer be legitimate under European law.",直销零售渠道常被不良商家滥用，这引发了各国立法者的严厉回应。因此，欧盟直销行业受到诸多不同贸易壁垒的限制。问题的核心在于直销行业贸易自由化与成员国为维护消费者经济利益而实施严格监管的自主权之间的利益冲突。本文评估了直销贸易壁垒与欧洲法律的兼容性，特别是与内部市场基本自由及消费者保护、公平交易法和服务提供相关次级法规的契合度。通过对欧盟法院针对四种直销贸易壁垒判例的比较分析发现，尽管耐人寻味的是法院在四起案件中均未裁定这些壁垒符合货物自由流动原则，但Keck公式难以操作的僵化性严重阻碍了法院作出明确判决。《消费者权益指令》有望为直销贸易壁垒问题带来亟需的明确性和法律确定性。结合对《不公平商业行为指令》和《服务指令》相关条款的评估，研究得出结论：自《消费者权益指令》生效之日起，在欧洲法律框架下制定或维持直销贸易壁垒将不再具有合法性。,"direct selling, trade barriers, product bans, channel bans",2013-10-31

Turkey is a founding member of the World Trade Organization and formed a customs union with the European Union (EU) in 1996. It has also signed numerous preferential trade agreements the EU has been involved in as part of its EU candidacy. The drastic intra and extra-group trade liberalization brought by the relations with the EU seems to be important determinants in the rise of Turkey’s contingent protection over the last decade. Moreover, apart from an increase in the number of initiations, the higher rate of initiations finding support and sluggishness in the removal of TTBs over time appear to have played a role in their build-up. Turkey has been significantly affected by the 2008-9 global economic crisis and at the same time kept increasing the use of TTBs. The increase as of 2009 was in line with the recent upward trend but the response to the crisis may come with a lag. In general, Turkey does not target established EU members with TTBs although there is no restriction. Turkey mainly targets developing countries, especially China, at rates disproportional to their import market share.",土耳其自20世纪90年代以来一直积极使用反倾销措施，近期更将保障措施和反补贴税纳入其临时贸易壁垒(TTBs)体系。该国作为世界贸易组织创始成员国，于1996年与欧盟建立关税同盟，并作为入盟候选国签署了多个欧盟参与的特惠贸易协定。与欧盟关系带来的集团内外大幅贸易自由化，似乎是过去十年土耳其临时保护措施兴起的重要诱因。值得注意的是，除立案数量增加外，立案支持率的提升及临时贸易壁垒撤销进程的迟滞，也助推了这类措施的累积效应。2008-2009年全球经济危机对土耳其冲击显著，但该国同期却持续强化临时贸易壁垒使用。2009年后的增长虽符合近期上行趋势，但对危机的政策响应可能存在滞后性。总体而言，土耳其虽无限制却鲜少对欧盟成熟成员国实施临时贸易壁垒，其主要针对发展中国家——特别是中国——实施与其进口市场份额不相称的高强度措施。,"Temporary trade barriers, antidumping, safeguards, countervailing duties, Turkey",2011-05-14

This paper surveys the literature on some of the political-economic issues that can arise at the intersection of preferential trade agreements and temporary trade barriers and uses four case studies to illustrate variation in how countries apply the World Trade Organization's global safeguards policy instrument. The four examples include recent policies applied by a variety of types of countries and under different agreements: large and small countries, high-income and emerging economies, and free trade areas and customs unions.

Cusolito,"Despite trade liberalization efforts made by Eurasian countries, the export structure of the region shows significant levels of concentration across export destinations. To shed light on this observation, this research analyzes trade policy barriers in Eurasia, East Asia and the Pacific, and the European Union. Using the most recent data from sources including the World Trade Organization, the United Nations, and the World Bank ? including the Overall Trade Restrictiveness Indices, the Services Trade Restrictions Database, and the Temporary Trade Barriers Database ? the role of tariffs, non-tariff measures, temporary trade barriers, trade agreements, and trade barriers in services are explored to explain the lack of diversification by destination. Several conclusions can be drawn from the analysis. First, China, Korea, and Japan, as well as the European Union, impose high levels of protection on products of animal origin, which may explain the lack of Eurasian export diversification toward the East Asia and the Pacific and the European Union regions. It also highlights the potential benefits of diversifying the structure of production in Eurasia toward more sophisticated and technologically intensive goods. Second, the East Asia and the Pacific region (especially China) appears to be more protectionist than the European Union, suggesting a greater challenge for Eurasian countries in diversifying exports to the destination. And third, few or no regional trade agreements exist between Eurasian countries and countries in the European Union or East Asia and the Pacific.",尽管欧亚国家做出了贸易自由化的努力，但该地区的出口结构在出口目的地方面仍表现出高度集中。为阐明这一现象，本研究分析了欧亚、东亚与太平洋地区以及欧盟的贸易政策壁垒。通过采用世界贸易组织、联合国和世界银行的最新数据——包括综合贸易限制指数、服务贸易限制数据库和临时贸易壁垒数据库——本研究探讨了关税、非关税措施、临时贸易壁垒、贸易协定以及服务贸易壁垒对出口目的地多元化不足的影响。分析可得出几点结论：首先，中国、韩国、日本及欧盟对动物源性产品实施高度保护，这可能是欧亚地区对东亚与太平洋地区及欧盟出口多元化不足的原因。研究同时指出，欧亚国家将生产结构转向技术密集型高端产品可能带来的潜在收益。其次，东亚与太平洋地区（特别是中国）的贸易保护程度高于欧盟，表明欧亚国家实现对该地区出口多元化的难度更大。第三，欧亚国家与欧盟或东亚及太平洋地区国家之间几乎不存在区域性贸易协定。,"Free Trade, Trade Policy, Trade Law, International Trade and Trade Rules, Economic Theory & Research",2016-04-20

The current expansion of trade and economic interactions with these countries has a positive effect on the economic development of the Far East. Reducing various barriers to trade with the APR countries can increase the scale of bilateral trade, acting as a source of growth and development for the economy of the Far East. To determine the ranges for increasing trade, the potential for trade interactions arising from the leveling of various barriers was quantified. It is shown that for the Far East a gradual change in the intensity of foreign trade relations was observed in favor of geographically close foreign markets, the Asia-Pacific countries. Based on the constructed gravity dependence, trade barriers for interactions between the Far East and Asia-Pacific countries were estimated and decomposed into the ad valorem equivalent. It was determined that the major source of tariff barriers was the tariff burden on exports and imports, formed by the Russian side. The decomposition assessment showed that the comparative institutional barriers between the Far East and the Asia-Pacific countries were significantly greater than the comparative tariff barriers. This circumstance indicated the insufficiency of reducing tariff barriers for intensifying the bilateral trade between the Far East and the Asia-Pacific countries. The analysis made it possible to assume that the introduction of various types of weakly motivated trade restrictions by the Russian side led to a shift in the customs burden from tariff barriers to institutional ones. In addition to the Republic of Korea, a general vector of intensification of trade between the Far East and the Asia-Pacific countries was observed for China. The estimates obtained suggest that the comparative institutional barriers between the Far Eastern regions and China will continue to decline. It is shown that the leveling of comparative institutional barriers between the Far East and Japan can significantly increase trade interactions between the Russian macroregion and the APR market.",由于远离俄罗斯主要销售市场，远东地区与亚太国家市场联系紧密。当前与这些国家贸易经济往来的扩大对远东经济发展产生了积极影响。降低与亚太国家的各类贸易壁垒可提升双边贸易规模，成为远东经济增长与发展的动力源。为测算贸易增长空间，研究量化了消除各类壁垒所带来的贸易互动潜力。数据显示，远东地区对外贸易关系强度正逐步向地理位置邻近的海外市场——亚太国家倾斜。基于构建的引力模型，研究估算了远东与亚太国家间的贸易壁垒，并将其分解为从价税等价形式。结果表明，关税壁垒主要源于俄方对进出口设置的关税负担。分解评估显示，远东与亚太国家间的制度性壁垒远超关税壁垒，这意味着仅靠降低关税不足以显著提升双边贸易规模。分析认为，俄方实施各类缺乏合理依据的贸易限制措施，导致海关负担从关税壁垒转向制度性壁垒。除韩国外，中国也成为远东与亚太国家贸易强化的主要方向。预测显示，远东各地区与中国间的制度性壁垒将持续下降。研究表明，消除远东与日本间的制度性壁垒将大幅提升俄罗斯大区与亚太市场的贸易往来。,"trade, trade barriers, institutional barriers, tariff barriers, Russian Far East",2021-07-19
trade barriers,DigitalTradeIntegration in PreferentialTradeAgreements,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3603741,Andrew D. Mitchell,"The growth of digital trade is dependant upon greater interconnectivity across borders. Several countries strive to achieve such interconnectivity and integration in digital trade through international trade agreements. Digital trade integration is a complex, multidimensional process that integrates regulatory structures/policy designs, digital technologies and business processes along the entire global/regional digital value chain. This paper sets out five foundational elements of digital trade integration: reducing digital trade barriers; digital trade facilitation; digital trade regulatory frameworks and digital trust policies; digital development and inclusion; and institutional coordination. It then examines the extent to which Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs) can or do contribute to digital integration.Some recent PTAs contain ambitious provisions to reduce regulatory barriers in digital trade and facilitate cross-border data flows. However, most PTAs fail to holistically support the five pillars of digital trade integration, and are particularly deficient in supporting digital development and inclusion, incorporating adequate digital trade facilitation measures, and facilitating meaningful international regulatory cooperation. This paper provides various policy recommendations to address such deficiencies. This paper also contains a case study of digital trade integration in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). It argues that the ASEAN framework currently functions as a weak form of digital trade integration, focusing mainly on political goodwill and high-level cooperation. Although the ASEAN Members are committed to enhancing regulatory cooperation and strengthening their institutions on electronic commerce, the development asymmetry coupled with the conflicting policy preferences of ASEAN Members remains a key obstacle.",数字贸易的增长依赖于跨境互联互通的加强。多个国家努力通过国际贸易协定实现数字贸易的互联互通与一体化。数字贸易一体化是一个复杂、多维度的过程，它将监管结构/政策设计、数字技术和业务流程整合到全球/区域数字价值链中。本文提出了数字贸易一体化的五个基本要素：减少数字贸易壁垒；数字贸易便利化；数字贸易监管框架和数字信任政策；数字发展与包容；以及机构协调。随后，文章探讨了优惠贸易协定（PTAs）在多大程度上能够或确实促进了数字一体化。一些近期的PTAs包含了雄心勃勃的条款，旨在减少数字贸易中的监管壁垒并促进跨境数据流动。然而，大多数PTAs未能全面支持数字贸易一体化的五大支柱，特别是在支持数字发展与包容、纳入充分的数字贸易便利化措施以及促进有意义的国际监管合作方面存在不足。本文针对这些不足提出了多项政策建议。本文还包含了一个关于东南亚国家联盟（东盟）数字贸易一体化的案例研究。研究认为，东盟框架目前作为一种较弱的数字贸易一体化形式运作，主要侧重于政治善意和高层合作。尽管东盟成员国致力于加强监管合作并强化电子商务领域的机构建设，但发展不对称以及成员国之间政策偏好的冲突仍是主要障碍。,"Digital trade, Digital trade integration, Trade barriers, International trade, PTAs, Trade facilitation, Trade policy, ASEAN",2020-07-07
trade barriers,Price Equalization Does Not Imply FreeTrade,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2038592,Piyusha Mutreja,"In this paper we show that price equalization alone is not sufficient to establish that there are no barriers to international trade. There are many barrier combinations that deliver price equalization, but each combination implies a different volume of trade. Therefore, in order to make statements about trade barriers it is necessary to know the trade flows. We demonstrate this first theoretically in a simple two-country model. We then extend the result quantitatively to a multi-country model with two sectors. We show that for the case of capital goods trade, barriers have to be large in order to be consistent with the observed trade flows. Our model also implies that capital goods prices look similar across countries, an implication that is consistent with data. Zero barriers to trade in capital goods will deliver price equalization in capital goods, but cannot reproduce the observed trade flows in our model.",本文指出，仅凭价格均等化现象不足以证明国际贸易不存在壁垒。存在多种能实现价格均等化的壁垒组合，但每种组合对应的贸易流量各不相同。因此，要准确判断贸易壁垒状况必须掌握贸易流动数据。我们首先通过一个简单的两国模型进行理论论证，随后将这一结论量化拓展至包含两个部门的多国模型。研究表明，在资本品贸易领域，只有设置较高壁垒才能与观测到的贸易流量相匹配。我们的模型还显示各国资本品价格呈现相似性，这一推论与实证数据相符。虽然零壁垒条件下资本品价格会趋于均等，但在本模型中无法复现实际观测到的贸易流量。,"Purchasing Power Parity, Capital Goods Prices, Bilateral Trade Flows, Trade Barriers",2012-04-12
trade barriers,TradeBarriersand Antitrust Analysis,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1967684,Seth B. Sacher,"This paper examines several important barriers to trade and discusses how they interact with antitrust market definition and competitive effects analysis.  It is shown that although various forms of tariffs reduce foreign firms static competitive significance, a tariff does not necessarily reduce their dynamic competitive significance.  Moreover, the administration of antidumping duties in the U.S. may actually increase the dynamic competitive significance of imports.  Finally, while quota can reduce foreign firms' static and dynamic significance, that does not mean the relevance of imports should be ignored.  Nevertheless, the proper treatment of trade barriers in antitrust analysis has no a priori impact on whether a transaction or practice will be viewed as more or less anticompetitive.",本文探讨了贸易中的几大重要壁垒，并分析了它们如何与反垄断市场界定及竞争效应分析相互作用。研究表明，尽管各类关税降低了外国企业的静态竞争影响力，但关税未必削弱其动态竞争重要性。此外，美国反倾销税的实施实际上可能提升进口商品的动态竞争作用。最后，虽然配额会削弱外国企业的静态与动态竞争地位，但这并不意味着应忽视进口商品的相关性。然而在反垄断分析中，对贸易壁垒的恰当处理并不会先验性地影响对交易或行为是否具有反竞争性质的判定。,"antitrust, trade barriers, market definition, competitive effects",2011-12-04

Restrictiveness of the access to market in four sectors of professional services is measured: accountancy, legal, architectural and engineering services. In the case of services - more frequently than for tangible goods - barriers take the form of government regulations determining the market entry / establishment of a business or the way of running the business. These regulations may discriminate against foreign entities, or not. This can be checked on the basis of questionnaires or the analysis of government documents (laws, regulations) and industry regulations (e.g. codes of professional ethics). Restrictions are given a numerical value and weight. In this way, restrictiveness index is  constructed, measuring access to the service industry. The rationale for using the index of restrictiveness as a measure of barriers in professional services is given. Construction of several such indices for different groups of services allows a comparison of the degree of restrictiveness of foreign access to the Polish market with respect to domestic services and service providers as well as between different industries. This is a base for further studies of the possible results of removing the barriers.",本文旨在衡量波兰专业服务贸易的壁垒，指出限制性最强的行业，并评估对外国服务及服务提供商的歧视程度。研究测算了四大专业服务领域的市场准入限制：会计、法律、建筑及工程服务。相较于有形商品，服务贸易壁垒更常以政府法规形式出现，这些法规决定着市场准入/商业实体的设立或运营方式。此类法规可能歧视外国实体，也可能一视同仁。可通过问卷调研或分析政府文件（法律、法规）及行业规范（如职业道德准则）进行验证。研究对各项限制措施赋予数值和权重，由此构建衡量服务业准入程度的限制性指数，并阐述了采用该指数作为专业服务壁垒衡量工具的理论依据。通过为不同服务类别构建多个此类指数，可比较波兰市场对外国服务及服务提供商的限制程度与本土的差异，以及各行业间的差异。这为后续研究消除壁垒可能带来的影响奠定了基础。,"restrictiveness index, barriers, trade in services, professional services, Poland",2017-04-18

Each and every country is engaged in trade by selling its products, obtaining what it lacks and manufacturing more precisely in certain sectors than its 9 rivals. This has emerged the need for scholars and researchers to comprehend the concepts of globalization, free trade, trade liberalism, trade protectionism, trade barriers, and international trade. However, the literature regarding the benefits of free trade, trade liberalism, globalization and the demerits of inward-looking economies is still evolving. Thus, the current review paper aims to highlight the impact of free trade and trade liberalization on the development of the world economy. Moreover, it aims to assess the effect of globalization on international trade practices and analyze the impacts of trade barriers and trade protectionism on world economies. The current study eventually believes that it is difficult for the inward looking economies to sustain in the long run, thus the economies must adopt free trade practices and globalization to be successful in the competitive world.",在当今全球经济格局中，没有任何国家能在信息和商品流动方面自称自给自足。每个国家都通过出售产品、获取所缺资源，并在特定领域比竞争对手更精准地进行生产来参与贸易。这促使学者和研究者必须理解全球化、自由贸易、贸易自由主义、贸易保护主义、贸易壁垒和国际贸易等概念。然而，关于自由贸易、贸易自由主义、全球化的益处以及内向型经济弊端的文献仍在不断发展。因此，本综述旨在强调自由贸易和贸易自由化对世界经济发展的影响，评估全球化对国际贸易实践的作用，并分析贸易壁垒和贸易保护主义对世界经济的影响。本研究最终认为，内向型经济难以长期维持，各国必须采取自由贸易实践和全球化策略，才能在竞争激烈的世界中取得成功。,"Globalization, Free trade, trade barriers, economic growth, trade liberalization, trade protectionism",2020-06-09

trade barriers,On the Non-discrimination Principles in DigitalTrade,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4077393,Jeongmeen Suh,"What do the provisions on the non-discrimination principle (“the principles”) in digital trade mean under trade agreements, especially in the absence of a clear international consensus on the subject of the principles? To answer this question, this study first identifies the issues related to the application of the principles in digital trade and presents a theoretical framework to explain how the principles can affect digital trade despite such issues. Using various data sources such as digital trade flows, the inclusion of the principles in digital trade agreements, and digital trade barriers, we empirically test the hypotheses constructed from our theoretical framework. We find that inclusion of the principles in the trade agreements is more likely to increase digital trade flows. Moreover, though digital trade barriers decrease digital trade flows, this negative effect can be mitigated when the principles are more clearly defined in the trade agreements.",贸易协定中关于数字贸易非歧视原则（“该原则”）的规定意味着什么，尤其是在该原则主题缺乏明确国际共识的情况下？为回答这一问题，本研究首先梳理了该原则在数字贸易应用中存在的问题，并构建理论框架解释这些问题下该原则如何影响数字贸易。通过整合数字贸易流量、贸易协定对该原则的纳入情况以及数字贸易壁垒等多维数据，我们对理论框架提出的假设进行实证检验。研究发现：贸易协定纳入该原则更可能促进数字贸易流量增长；尽管数字贸易壁垒会抑制贸易流量，但当协定对该原则的界定更为清晰时，这种负面影响能够被显著缓解。,"digital trade, non-discrimination principle, digital trade agreement, digital trade barriers",2022-04-20

The Commission concluded the benefits of these agreements have been oversold and the processes for developing them should be improved. The Commission found that while there is the potential for some gains from preferential agreements, unilateral reform and non-discriminatory trade liberalisation offer larger benefits. While tariff preferences in trade agreements can benefit some industries, the Commission found little evidence that Australia's recent bilateral agreements had provided substantial commercial benefits. The main factors that influence decisions to do business in other countries are likely to lie outside the scope of such agreements. The study concluded that while preferential trade agreements could increase national income, the net effect is likely to be modest. The study also found that some provisions included in Australia's recent preferential trade agreements – including investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms, government procurement requirements, intellectual property protections and provisions affecting areas traditionally the province of domestic policy, such as culture – potentially entail significant costs or risks. To ensure that options other than trade agreements are properly considered, and that any further agreements entered into are warranted, the study recommended that the Government make changes to its trade policy development processes. Under the Commission's proposals, the Government would undertake an annual Trade Policy Review to better identify priorities, enhance the value of consultation and consider trade policy in a broader context.

In  this  approach,  countries  have  been treated  as  components  of  system,  with  relationships  of  diverse  character  existing  between them,  e.g.  transfers  of  works  of  art,  export  and  import  of  art.  The  paper  presents  ways  by which  countries  are  connected  in  terms  of  art  flows,  while  differentiating  market  from  non-market sphere. The aim of the paper is to identify factors influencing international trade in art in the light of assumed system concept. Among internal factors (related to system components – countries), influencing international trade in art, the following have been mentioned: wealth of a  country, its economic situation, stock of  works of art available in a country, internal  art market,  demographic  features,  number  and  structure of  population,  including  the  figure  of population  with  high  level  of  income,  number  of  living  artists  and  status  of  artist,  state interventionism  and  others.

trade barriers,Cyclical and Structural Aspects of the Recent Export Trends: Evidence from Korea,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3554758,Sooyoung Lee,"Purpose – This paper investigates the recent trade collapse, recovery, and prolonged slowdown to shed light on the discussions about whether the current slowdown is structural or cyclical. I examine structural, cyclical, and heterogeneous aspects of the recent trade trends using detailed statistics of a small open economy, South Korea, whose economic success and growth have been heavily dependent on exports.Design/methodology – I use both aggregated and disaggregated trade statistics of South Korea. I apply the following methodologies: 1) I decompose the trade growth into the extensive and the intensive margin and observe the effect of prices over time. 2) I estimate the trade-income elasticities focusing on the world’s import demand, separately for goods from the world and from Korea. 3) I compare the drop in goods exports in slowdown and trade collapse, which are the two unusual periods in the recent history when world trade has substantially dropped altogether.Findings – I show that while the last drop of trade after 2015 has cyclical aspects, there is evidence that the continued slowdown from 2012 is structural: 1) the so-called ‘China factor’ is found in the analysis of trade-income elasticity of the world and China for imports from Korea. 2) The bilateral trade barriers between Korea and its principal trading partners are universally tightening. 3) Firm sizes, destination countries, and the mode of transactions affect disaggregated trade flows during the slowdown periods.Originality/value – This paper contributes to the debate regarding whether the current trade slowdown is structural or cyclical. I provide two concrete evidence that the export drop in 2015 stems from low oil prices: one is the divergence of Korean export value index from its export quantity index, which started in late 2014 when oil prices plunged. I also contribute to the literature by providing evidence that Korea’s trade barriers with important trading partners are steadily increasing since 2012 as the protectionist measures toward Korea’s export products are steeply increasing after the global financial crisis.","目的——本文通过研究近期贸易的崩溃、复苏与持续放缓现象，旨在厘清当前贸易减速是结构性还是周期性的争论。笔者以高度依赖出口推动经济增长的典型小型开放经济体韩国为例，运用其详实贸易数据，从结构性、周期性与异质性三个维度解析近期贸易趋势。研究方法——综合运用韩国总体与分类贸易统计数据，采用以下分析方法：1）将贸易增长分解为扩展边际与集约边际，观测价格因素的时序影响；2）聚焦全球进口需求，分别测算全球及韩国商品的贸易收入弹性；3）对比近期全球贸易整体大幅下滑的两个特殊阶段——贸易崩溃期与减速期的商品出口跌幅。研究发现——2015年后贸易下滑呈现周期性特征，但2012年以来的持续放缓存在结构性证据：1）在全球及中国对韩进口的贸易收入弹性分析中发现""中国因素""影响；2）韩国与主要贸易伙伴的双边贸易壁垒普遍强化；3）企业规模、目标市场及交易模式在贸易减速期显著影响分类贸易流量。创新价值——本研究为贸易减速性质之争提供新见解：通过韩国出口价值指数与数量指数自2014年末油价暴跌时出现的背离，证实2015年出口下滑源于油价走低；同时揭示全球金融危机后，针对韩国出口产品的保护主义措施激增，导致2012年以来其与重要伙伴的贸易壁垒持续升高。","Great Trade Collapse, South Korea, Trade Barriers, Trade Slowdown",2020-04-09
compliance,Drug Pricing - The NextComplianceWaterloo,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3127733,Seth Whitelaw,"The current drug pricing war pits the pharmaceutical companies against doctors, hospitals, insurers, regulators, and consumers. The pharmaceutical industry has been fighting this war for more than two decades and is now engaged in a rearguard action.  Their actions may delay the tidal wave of regulatory efforts, but, ultimately, the legislators, payers, and public will prevail.  It is only a matter of time. While legislative efforts continue to evolve, some form of transparency or disclosure is at the heart of all these efforts.  Thus, the discussion has shifted from whether there should be disclosure to what information is needed and who will have access to the information. While the current landscape is tumultuous and unsettled, drug pricing transparency is not a topic that is going to fade away. In the short term, for the pharmaceutical manufacturers facing an onslaught of pricing legislation, it comes down to trust, and trust is something that compliance professionals know a great deal about.  Compliance professionals also have the tools and processes to help companies demonstrate social responsibility and trustworthiness.

compliance,The Dark Side ofCompliance,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3451586,J.S. Nelson,"Compliance — from the root “to comply” — is “the set of rules, principles, controls, authorities, offices, and practices designed to ensure that the organization conforms to external and internal norms.” But towards what ends does management use an organization’s compliance system? Compliance ideally has aspirational goals to at least discourage outright violations of the law, if not to encourage ethical behavior more generally. The methods through which management enforces compliance, however, can increase unethical behavior within the corporation and have, in some cases, incubated and helped perpetuate illegal behavior. As with all other tools, the tools of compliance can be abused. This chapter explores management abuse of corporate compliance systems, and it provides a caution about the dark side of compliance.",合规（Compliance）——源于“遵守”一词——是指“为确保组织符合外部和内部规范而制定的一系列规则、原则、控制措施、权力机构、职能部门及实践”。但管理层运用企业合规体系的终极目标是什么？理想状态下，合规至少应具有震慑违法行为的崇高目标，更广义上还应促进道德行为。然而管理层推行合规的具体手段，反而可能助长企业内部的不道德行为，某些情况下甚至滋生并延续了非法行为。如同所有工具，合规工具也可能被滥用。本章将探讨管理层对企业合规体系的滥用，并揭示合规背后的阴暗面。,"compliance, data, monitoring, culture, norms, wrongdoing, wide-spread, corporate, corporations, board of directors, management, compliance officers, control, methods of control, pressure, incentives, goals",2019-09-16
compliance,From Responsive Regulation to EcologicalCompliance: Meta-regulation and the Existential Challenge of CorporateCompliance,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3916471,Christine Parker,"This chapter revisits the significance of responsive regulation for theories of compliance. It shows how responsive regulation’s theory of compliance recognises both multiple motivations for compliance and plural actors who help negotiate and construct compliance. It argues that responsive regulation theory implies responsive compliance and that this can help build possibilities for deliberative democratic responsibility and accountability of both businesses and regulators. This is the idea that Parker previously labelled the meta-regulation of the “open corporation”. This chapter concludes that since business activity, and indeed human development, now face the existential challenge of socio ecological disruption and collapse in which profit oriented commercial activity is a significant driver, theories of compliance need to expand to concern themselves with how whole markets and industries can be made responsive to both social and ecological embeddedness. Regulatory compliance scholars need to pay attention to how networks of interacting business, government and civil society and social movement actors can influence business activity profoundly enough to shift the very nature of “business as usual”. The chapter therefore proposes the need for “ecological compliance” as a development of Ayres and Braithwaite’s analysis of compliance.","本章重新审视了回应性监管对合规理论的重要意义。它展示了回应性监管的合规理论如何同时认识到合规的多元动机，以及协助协商构建合规的多元主体。文章论证回应性监管理论意味着回应性合规，这有助于为企业和监管者构建协商民主责任与问责的可能性——这一理念曾被帕克称为""开放型企业""的元监管。本章结论指出，鉴于商业活动乃至人类发展当前面临着社会生态破坏与崩溃这一生存挑战（其中以利润为导向的商业活动是重要推手），合规理论需要拓展视野，关注如何使整个市场和产业对社会及生态嵌入性作出回应。监管合规学者应关注企业、政府、公民社会及社会运动参与者构成的互动网络，如何能对商业活动产生足够深刻的影响，从而改变""一切照旧""的商业本质。因此本章提出需要发展""生态合规""概念，作为对艾尔斯和布雷斯韦特合规分析的延伸。","responsive regulation, compliance, meta-regulation, corporate social responsibility, smart regulation, ecological regulation, ecological compliance",2021-09-04

compliance,"Internal CorporateComplianceManagement Systems: Structure, Culture and Agency",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1790283,Christine Parker,"Since the 1970s a number of influential regulatory scholars have suggested that it ought to be possible to empirically identify internal management structures, decision making processes, employee training and other practices that can effectively prevent misconduct in corporations. Moreover, it has been suggested that it should be possible to design government or voluntary regulatory programs that would force or encourage corporations to self-regulate by putting in place these corporate compliance management systems. In this contribution to the edited collection, Explaining Compliance (Parker and Nielsen eds), we briefly describe the main empirical research questions regarding corporate compliance management systems that scholarly regulation literature attempts to answer. These questions concern the extent to which corporations actually do implement compliance systems, why they do so, and what impact, if any, these systems have on compliance behavior. We suggest that in order to answer these questions, it is useful to use the generic sociological concepts of structure, culture and agency. That is, it is important to study the interaction between the adoption of formal systems for compliance management (one component of structure), the perceptions, motivations and strategies of individuals within the corporation in relation to compliance (agency), and the local  norms and habituated practices (culture or cultures) that mediate between corporate structures and individual agency. We summarise our own qualitative in depth interview studies of large organizations’ implementation of compliance management systems and other empirical literature on corporate compliance management systems to show how structure and agency interact through culture at three nodes: top management decisions to implement a compliance system; the compliance strategies of specialised compliance managers; and, the ways in which compliance systems are communicated to and experienced by individual employees. The paper concludes by summarizing a preliminary attempt to more systematically identify and test structure, agency and culture in compliance system implementation, and their effects.",自20世纪70年代以来，多位具有影响力的监管学者提出，应当可以通过实证研究识别出能够有效预防企业不当行为的内部管理结构、决策流程、员工培训等实践方法。更有学者主张，通过设计政府强制或自愿性监管计划，促使或鼓励企业通过建立合规管理体系进行自我监管。本文为《解读合规》（帕克与尼尔森主编）论文集的撰稿章节，简要梳理了监管学术文献试图解答的关于企业合规管理体系的核心实证研究问题，包括企业实际建立合规体系的程度、动因及其对合规行为的影响效应。我们认为，要解答这些问题，可借助结构、文化与能动性这三个社会学基础概念框架——即需要研究正式合规管理制度的建立（结构要素）、企业内部人员对合规的认知动机与策略（能动性）、以及调和组织结构与个体能动性的地方性规范与惯常实践（文化要素）三者间的互动关系。通过总结我们对大型组织合规管理体系实施的深度定性访谈研究，并结合其他相关实证文献，我们展示了结构与能动性如何在三个关键节点通过文化产生交互作用：高管层推行合规体系的决策、专职合规经理的应对策略、以及合规体系在基层员工层面的传达与体验。文末总结了我们为系统识别和检验合规体系实施中的结构、能动性、文化要素及其影响效应所作的初步探索。,"regulation, compliance, organizational behavior, compliance systems",2011-03-20
compliance,ComplianceEthnography: What Gets Lost inComplianceMeasurement,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3853756,Benjamin van Rooij,"Drawing on data from two ethnographies on organizational compliance in China, this chapter offers three important insights about what gets lost in traditional quantitative measures of organizational compliance. First, the studies show that compliance is muddled. A close-up view of the actual business responses to the law are hard to capture in binary or numerical terms (or even in more nuanced labeling such as motivational postures or levels of commitment); in everyday practice there are many instances of both rule obeying and rule violating behavior. Second, compliance is dynamic and varies at different points in time and in their situational contexts. Third, the studies show that compliance can be a non-linear process in which compliance occurs even when there is no chain of transmission from governmental regulators to compliance managers to individual workers. The chapter draws out what these insights mean for the study and practice of compliance measurement. Ultimately, there is a strong need for multi-method research that combines understanding complexity through in-depth case studies (combining participant observation with interviews) alongside statistical analysis in quantitative work.",本章借鉴了两项关于中国组织合规性的民族志研究数据，提出了三个重要见解，揭示了传统定量测量方法中遗漏的关键内容。首先，研究表明合规状态具有模糊性。实际商业行为对法律回应的微观细节难以用二元对立或数值化方式（甚至动机姿态、承诺等级等更精细标签）准确捕捉；日常实践中同时存在大量遵守规则与违反规则的混合实例。其次，合规具有动态特征，会随时间节点和情境背景发生变化。第三，研究显示合规可能呈现非线性过程——即便缺乏从政府监管者到合规管理者再到基层员工的传导链条，合规行为仍可能发生。本章阐明了这些发现对合规测量研究与实践的启示。最终指出亟需采用多方法研究路径：在定量工作中结合统计分析的同时，通过深度案例研究（参与式观察与访谈相结合）来理解复杂性。,"qualitative methods, ethnography, corporate compliance, organizational deviance, participant observation",2021-05-28
compliance,A Behavioural Economics Perspective onCompliance,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3929624,Sheheryar Banuri,"Protecting employee whistle-blowers is important, as this is a significant source of uncovering wrongdoing, both for public, and private organizations. How whistle-blowers make decisions is complex, and potential whistle-blowers may not have complete information on the strategies that are chosen by their organizations in response. Hence, whistle-blowers must undertake decisions in uncertain conditions. It is in dealing with this uncertainty where behavioural economics is informative.  This paper reviews the behavioural economics perspective on compliance with rules (broadly) and with whistle-blowing and antitrust compliance (more specifically) culminating in a series of recommendations for organizations seeking to improve employee compliance and detection of potential infringements of the law.  I focus on four main points: First, is the importance of voluntary compliance (as opposed to enforced compliance). This is important because it carries a broader set of actions than enforced compliance (which typically pertains to behaviour that is observable).  Highlighting non-pecuniary rewards, such as benefits to society, reputational gains, and career impacts, are critical.  Second, is the importance of perceptions and beliefs.  Focusing on whistle-blower protections and correcting beliefs regarding the risks (and potential losses) associated with reporting are critical.   Third, beliefs are typically the result of social norms: shared expectations of behaviour. Collecting information on norms and correcting misperceptions is an important way to increase compliance. Fourth, selecting the right workers: Selecting workers with strong preferences for compliance (those that are more pro-socially motivated) allows for increases in compliance without the need of strong monetary incentives.",保护员工举报人很重要，因为这是揭露公共和私营机构不当行为的重要来源。举报人如何做出决定是复杂的，潜在的举报人可能无法完全了解其组织选择的应对策略。因此，举报人必须在不确定的条件下做出决定。行为经济学正是在处理这种不确定性方面提供了有益见解。本文回顾了行为经济学对规则遵守（广义上）以及举报和反垄断合规（更具体地）的视角，最终为寻求提高员工合规性和发现潜在违法行为的组织提出了一系列建议。我主要关注四点：首先，自愿合规（与强制合规相对）的重要性。这一点很重要，因为它涵盖的行动范围比强制合规更广（后者通常只涉及可观察的行为）。强调非金钱奖励，如社会效益、声誉收益和职业影响，至关重要。其次，是认知和信念的重要性。关注举报人保护并纠正与举报相关的风险（和潜在损失）的信念至关重要。第三，信念通常是社会规范的结果：对行为的共同期望。收集有关规范的信息并纠正误解是提高合规性的重要途径。第四，选择合适的员工：选择那些具有强烈合规偏好（更倾向于亲社会动机）的员工，可以在不需要强大金钱激励的情况下提高合规性。,"Compliance, whistle-blowing, behaviour, social norms, ethics",2021-11-17

The article demonstrates the interplay between opportunity structures constituted by transnationalization of public policymaking and domestic institutional setting, and how forces of compliance resonate in the domestic politics of compliance. The empirical findings are based on Turkey's compliance with Basel standards. It relies on fieldwork that involves semi-structured qualitative interviews with senior regulators and bankers, which are complemented with analysis of secondary data. The article shows that a capable and willing regulator could capitalize on the top-down policymaking style which restricts the regulatee's access to international negotiations, and sets the terms at the domestic level. Direct access to international negotiations, resource asymmetry in favor of the regulator, and superior “negotiation knowledge” helped the regulator pacify a critical, skeptical regulatee, and drive the compliance process. The article also shows that the compliance process takes place at three stages: policy formulation at the international level, an “interpretation stage” in between the international and the domestic levels, and finally the domestic policy process.","本文有助于我们理解发展中国家如何以及为何会遵守国际银行业监管标准——巴塞尔标准。文章揭示了公共政策跨国化与国内制度环境所构成的机会结构之间的相互作用，以及合规力量如何在国家内部政治中产生共鸣。实证研究基于土耳其对巴塞尔标准的遵守情况，通过实地调研收集了与高级监管人员和银行家的半结构化定性访谈，并辅以二手数据分析。研究表明，一个能力强且意愿高的监管机构能够利用自上而下的决策风格——这种风格限制了被监管者参与国际谈判的机会，并在国内层面设定规则。监管机构凭借直接参与国际谈判的权限、资源不对称优势以及更胜一筹的""谈判知识""，成功安抚了持批评与怀疑态度的被监管方，并推动了合规进程。文章还指出，合规过程分为三个阶段：国际层面的政策制定、国际与国内层面之间的""解释阶段""，以及最终的国内政策落实过程。","compliance, banking regulation, international regulatory standards, Basel III, developing countries",2021-02-07

compliance,The Privatization ofCompliance,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2443887,Scott Killingsworth,"Corporate Compliance is becoming privatized, and privatization is going viral.  Achieving consistent legal compliance in today’s regulatory environment is a severe challenge and one at which even well-managed companies regularly fail.  But besides coping with governmental oversight and legal enforcement, companies now face a growing array of both substantive and process-oriented compliance obligations imposed by trading partners and other private organizations, sometimes but not always instigated by the government.  Embodied in contract clauses and codes of conduct for business partners, these obligations often go beyond mere compliance with law and address the methods by which compliance is assured. They create new compliance obligations and enforcement mechanisms and touch upon the structure, design, priorities, functions and administration of corporate ethics and compliance programs. And these obligations are contagious: increasingly accountable not only for their own compliance but also that of their supply chains, companies must seek corresponding contractual assurances upstream, causing a chain reaction of proliferating and sometimes inconsistent mandates. This essay examines the origins and the accelerating growth of the privatization of compliance requirements and oversight; highlights critical differences between compliance obligations imposed between private parties and those imposed by governmental actors; and evaluates the trend's benefits, drawbacks and likely direction.  Particular attention is given to the use of supplier codes of conduct and contractual compliance mandates, often in combination; to the issue of contractual remedies for social, process-oriented, or vague obligations that may have little direct bearing on the object of the associated business transaction; to the proliferating trend of requiring business partners to ""flow down"" required conduct and compliance mechanisms to additional tiers within the supply chain; and to this trend's challenging implications for the corporate compliance function's role and its interaction with operations, procurement, and sales groups.  Recommendations are made for achieving efficiencies and reducing system dysfunction by seeking a broad consensus on generally accepted principles for business-partner codes of conduct, compliance-related contract clauses, and remedies appropriate to each.","企业合规正在私有化，而私有化趋势正呈现病毒式蔓延。在当今监管环境下实现持续的法律合规是一项严峻挑战，即使管理完善的企业也常在此折戟。除了应对政府监管与法律执行，企业如今还面临交易伙伴和其他私营组织强加的日益增多的实体性与程序性合规义务——这些要求有时受政府推动但并非总是如此。这些义务体现在商业伙伴的合同条款与行为准则中，往往超越单纯的法律合规，直指确保合规的方法论。它们催生新的合规义务与执行机制，涉及企业道德与合规体系的结构、设计、优先级、职能及管理。且这些义务具有传染性：企业不仅要对自身合规负责，还需为供应链背书，必须向上游寻求对等的合同保证，由此引发层层传导、有时甚至相互冲突的强制要求链式反应。本文探讨合规要求与监管私有化的起源及加速发展；重点解析私营主体间合规义务与政府强加义务的关键差异；并评估该趋势的利弊及可能走向。研究特别关注供应商行为准则与合同合规要求的组合运用；针对社会性、程序性或模糊义务（可能与合作商业交易目标无直接关联）的合同救济问题；要求商业伙伴将行为规范与合规机制""下沉""至供应链更深层级的扩散趋势；以及该趋势对企业合规职能定位及其与运营、采购、销售部门互动的复杂影响。为提升效率并减少系统紊乱，本文建议就商业伙伴行为准则、合规相关合同条款及相应救济措施建立广泛认可的基本原则共识。","compliance, ethics, supply chain, privatization, code of conduct, sentencing guidelines, P2P, compliance programs, FCPA, money laundering, corruption, bribery, human rights, corporate social responsibility, OECD, CSR, sustainability, contracts, remedies, management, collective action",2014-06-01

compliance,The Unconscious Conscience of Digital Transformation: The ChiefComplianceOfficer,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4471247,Michele Beardslee DeStefano,"Corporations around the globe are embracing Digital Transformation (“DT”) to enhance competitiveness i.e., streamline operations, strengthen relationships with customers, and increase revenue. In this dynamic digital world, where data and algorithms are increasingly leveraged both for decision-making and to achieve economic and social objectives, a relevant digital transformation requires corporations to, not only onboard new technologies and ways of working, but also to address how they will be using tech in a responsible, ethical, customer/consumer-centric, and sustainable way. Necessarily, functions that directly impact the bottom line (like Sales, R&D, Supply Chain) are deeply engaged in these DT efforts. The question is what role is and should Compliance be playing in these DT efforts.This thought piece focuses on the evolving role of the Compliance function in this rapidly developing ecosystem, analyzing what role does – and should – the Compliance function play in DT and how should the Compliance function future-proof itself to better manage the governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) aspects of their corporation’s DT initiatives and better leverage the environment, social, and governance (“ESG”) objectives of their company. To address these questions, the authors interviewed two heads of Compliance at larger multinational corporations and facilitated a Salon hosted by the Digital Legal Exchange, entitled ""The Role of Compliance In Digital Transformation: Old Habits Risk Harm”. This event was attended by 12 participants including several General Counsel and Compliance professionals. The Salon was conducted under the Chatham House rule. All participants consented to an anonymised write up for these purposes. The purpose of this piece is to provoke more international, cross border discussion around the role of Compliance in digital transformation.",全球企业正积极拥抱数字化转型（“DT”），以提升竞争力，即优化运营、强化客户关系并增加收入。在这个动态的数字世界中，数据和算法被越来越多地用于决策以及实现经济和社会目标。真正的数字化转型要求企业不仅要引入新技术和工作方式，还需确保以负责任、符合道德、以客户/消费者为中心且可持续的方式运用技术。直接影响利润的部门（如销售、研发、供应链）必然深度参与这些转型努力。问题在于，合规部门在这些转型中扮演着什么角色，又应当承担何种职责？本文聚焦于合规职能在这一快速发展的生态系统中的演变，分析合规部门在数字化转型中的现有及应有角色，并探讨如何通过前瞻性布局，更好地管理企业数字化转型中的治理、风险与合规（GRC）问题，同时更有效地利用公司的环境、社会与治理（“ESG”）目标。为回答这些问题，作者采访了两家大型跨国企业的合规负责人，并主持了由数字法律交流平台举办的沙龙，主题为“合规在数字化转型中的角色：旧习惯恐酿新风险”。活动共有12位参与者，包括多位总法律顾问和合规专业人士。沙龙遵循查塔姆研究所规则进行，所有参与者同意为本文目的匿名撰写内容。本文旨在激发更多关于合规在数字化转型中角色的国际跨境讨论。,"compliance, digital transformation, law, legal marketplace, general counsel",2023-06-19

It concludes that at least in Germany the introduction of a criminal offence for horizontal hardcore cartels beyond the existing bid-rigging offence would be desirable, provided an automatic criminal immunity provision for immunity recipients under a leniency programme within the European Competition Network is introduced and the Bundeskartellamt is involved in the criminal prosecution. The introduction of effective criminal enforcement would make compliance training both more important and more effective. Criminalisation makes compliance more important because compliance training helps to spread knowledge about the criminal offence — and only a known threat can deter. Criminalisation makes compliance training more effective because the participants of compliance sessions are motivated to pay attention to avoid criminal liability.",本章阐述了欧盟部分成员国刑事执法的现状，并从政策角度探讨了竞争法刑事执法的可取性。结论表明，至少在德国，针对横向核心卡特尔（除现有串通投标罪行外）增设刑事罪名是可取的，前提是引入欧洲竞争网络内宽大政策下豁免获得者自动刑事免责条款，并让联邦卡特尔局参与刑事起诉。引入有效刑事执法将使合规培训既更为重要又更具实效。刑事化提升合规重要性，因为合规培训有助于普及刑事罪行的认知——唯有知晓威胁方能形成威慑；刑事化增强合规培训效果，因为参训者为避免刑责会更专注学习。,"antitrust enforcement, individual sanctions, criminal law, compliance",2016-04-28

Those reviews of “dispute settlement mechanisms” tend to concentrate on courts on the one hand and on tribunals on the other.  Commentators over the last forty years have praised the concept of third-party dispute settlement as a great achievement in our sovereigntist discipline.   These are typically state-to-state mechanisms, although not exclusively so.  Thus, when we consider “compliance” in international law, most questions of design concentrate on these institutions in which one state maintains that another violated the latter’s commitments.  Today, however, the targets of international legal obligations are changing and with them, the concept of compliance, especially in trade law on which this chapter concentrates.The chapter proceeds in three parts.  First, it analyzes the trade enforcement/compliance conundrum through examples arising under these innovative mechanisms in recent trade agreements.  Second, it turns to an assessment of trade non-compliance mechanisms (NCMs) and argues that they both exhibit significant potential for an expansive reach while also suffering from shortcomings.  Finally, the paper closes by mapping these normative evaluations onto conventional compliance theories to draw conclusions about those theories’ resilience and flexibility before making recommendations both for trade law and international law more generally.",国际法学界围绕争端解决的制度设计问题已耗费大量笔墨。这些对“争端解决机制”的探讨往往一方面集中于法院，另一方面则聚焦于仲裁庭。过去四十年间，评论者们一直将第三方争端解决机制誉为我们这个主权学科领域的重大成就。这类机制通常适用于国家间争端，尽管并非绝对如此。因此，当我们探讨国际法中的“合规”问题时，大多数制度设计议题都聚焦于这类机构——即一国主张另一国违反其承诺的场域。然而当下，国际法律义务的约束对象正在发生变化，合规概念也随之转变，本章重点讨论的贸易法领域尤其如此。. . 本章分为三部分展开论述。首先，通过近期贸易协定中创新机制引发的案例，剖析贸易执行与合规困境。其次，转向评估贸易领域的非合规机制（NCMs），论证其既展现出广泛适用的巨大潜力，又存在明显缺陷。最后，文章将这些规范性评价与传统合规理论进行对照，在得出关于理论韧性与适应性结论的基础上，分别对贸易法及更广义的国际法提出改革建议。,"trade, labor, environment, trade-plus, enforcement, dispute settlement, compliance",2022-06-07

However, federal agencies’ public procurement and compliance tools have remained relatively unaffected by technology when compared to other industries. If Government agencies continue to lag behind in their compliance efforts, then Government agencies’ risk exposure to a specific type of lawsuit called a bid-protest will remain static. Bid-protests cause time delays for government projects and cost contractors and the Government substantial amounts of money each year. Government agencies should use technology to standardize and automate their source selection scoring procedures in order to improve their regulatory compliance and gain cost-efficient advantages.This paper provides an algorithm that standardizes and automates Government agencies’ source selection scoring systems. Scholars have suggested different approaches to improve the source selection process that focus on regulatory changes to the structure of the acquisition process. However, those suggestions fail to consider how technology may be used to improve source selection and regulatory compliance within the current structure of the acquisition process. This paper takes an informatics based approach to reducing the occurrence of common compliance failures that arise from defective source selection procedures. Government agencies may drastically reduce the occurrence of compliance failures and resulting bid-protests by adopting the analytical framework proposed in this paper.",技术正以加速的步伐改变着世界。然而与其他行业相比，联邦机构的公共采购和合规工具受技术影响相对较小。如果政府机构在合规工作中持续落后，那么其对投标抗议这类诉讼的风险敞口将维持不变。投标抗议导致政府项目进度延误，每年使承包商和政府蒙受巨大经济损失。政府机构应当运用技术手段实现来源选择评分程序的标准化与自动化，从而提升合规水平并获取成本效益优势。本文提出了一种算法，可标准化和自动化政府机构的来源选择评分系统。学界曾提出多种改进来源选择流程的方案，主要聚焦于采购流程结构的法规修订。但这些建议未能探讨如何在现有采购流程框架下运用技术手段优化来源选择与合规管理。本文采用信息学方法，旨在减少因来源选择程序缺陷导致的常见合规失误。政府机构采用本文提出的分析框架，可显著降低合规失败及由此引发的投标抗议事件发生率。,"Technology, law, compliance, government contracts, legal informatics",2018-10-05

It will also examine some of the cases that have come before the Aarhus Compliance Committee in its first 5 years. Public participation can significantly increase the amount of activity under a compliance mechanism and the experience so far demonstrates that the public raises serious issues of compliance and implementation. However, the response of governments to date has been mixed, so that the degree of increased compliance that may occur from public complaints is still an open question.

compliance,Justifying Delay: Why Agencies DelayComplianceDates and How They Do It,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3184584,Nicholas Bednar,"Every administration since President Reagan has used compliance delays to postpone the implementation of midnight rules promulgated by the outgoing administration. Recent cases involving the Trump Administration’s delay of Obama Administration rules have reinvigorated courts’ interests in whether such delays require notice and an opportunity for comment under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). Some scholars have written about why incoming administrations use compliance delays to prevent implementation of the previous administration’s “midnight rules.” These delays are often cast as a precursor to repeal, engendering fears that the now-postponed final rule will be reversed. Yet a more overarching discussion of compliance delays is largely absent from the literature. This Article seeks to fill the literary void with two arguments. First, I argue that compliance delays serve a healthy role in the regulatory process. Part I provides a case study of the Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) Menu-Labeling Rule. Using this case study and other examples, Part II builds a typology of five justifications used by agencies when implementing compliance delays. Part III recognizes that an agency’s justification may not equate to its reason for delay and, therefore, briefly examines how external pressures may distort these justifications. In a brief interlude, I conclude that compliance delays are a valuable procedural tool  that leads to additional transparency and responsive governance. Second, I consider what procedures agencies should be required to use to delay compliance dates.  Part IV presents two options — “delay rules” and “enforcement delays” — and the drawbacks of each. Delay rules officially amend compliance dates. However, recent case law suggests that delay rules must be implemented through notice-and-comment rulemaking. In contrast, an agency using an enforcement delay will allow the compliance date to elapse but choose not to enforce the rule for a certain period of time. Courts are critical of enforcement delays, which may lead agencies to implement the policy secretly, only allowing its existence to be leaked in ex parte communications. Part IV concludes by suggesting that agencies will choose enforcement delays over delay rules to avoid the resource costs of notice-and-comment rule-making. The conclusion synthesizes these two arguments and suggests that the choice between delay rules and enforcement delays is one of procedure or transparency. If agencies select enforcement delays, the benefits of increased transparency and responsive governance disappear. I argue in favor of transparency, concluding that delay rules should be exempt — in one form or another — from APA rulemaking requirements.","自里根总统以来，每一届政府都利用合规延期来推迟实施即将离任政府颁布的""午夜规则""。近期涉及特朗普政府推迟奥巴马政府规则的案例，重新激发了法院对于此类延期是否需根据《行政程序法》（APA）履行通知和征求意见程序的关注。部分学者已撰文探讨为何新政府通过合规延期阻止上届政府""午夜规则""的实施。这些延期常被视为废除规则的前奏，引发人们对已推迟最终规则将被撤销的担忧。然而现有文献普遍缺乏对合规延期的系统性讨论。本文试图通过两方面论证填补这一空白：首先，我认为合规延期在监管过程中具有积极作用。第一部分以美国食品药品监督管理局（FDA）""菜单标签规则""为案例，第二部分以此为基础归纳出机构实施合规延期的五种正当理由类型。第三部分指出机构宣称的理由可能并非真实动机，并简要分析外部压力如何扭曲这些理由。通过简短插叙，我得出结论认为合规延期是促进透明度与响应式治理的有益程序工具。其次，我探讨机构延期合规日期应遵循的程序要求。第四部分提出""延期规则""与""执法延期""两种方案及其缺陷——延期规则需正式修改合规日期，但近期判例表明其必须通过通知评论规则制定程序实施；而执法延期则允许合规期限届满后暂不执行规则，但法院对此持批判态度，可能导致机构通过单方面沟通秘密实施政策。该部分最终指出，为避免通知评论程序的资源消耗，机构倾向于选择执法延期。结论部分整合两项论证，指出两种延期方式的本质是程序与透明度的抉择——若选择执法延期，增强透明度与响应式治理的优势将不复存在。我主张维护透明度，建议应以某种形式豁免延期规则适用APA规则制定要求。","Regulation, Administrative Law, Compliance, Delay",2018-06-10
compliance,"Agency, Authority, andCompliance",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3462638,Sean J. Griffith,"Compliance can and often does serve as a conduit through which regulators and enforcement authorities enlarge their authority beyond statutory bounds.  The potential to do so is a function of the symbiotic relationship between compliance officers and regulatory authorities.  Compliance officers owe their professional existence and their organizational authority to the interventions of regulators and enforcement agents.  This creates a unique incentive structure and renders compliance officers especially receptive to regulators’ extra-legal pronouncements.  As a result, the separation of compliance from legal and the elevation of the compliance function as the co-equal of the legal department, a structure often insisted upon by regulators and enforcement authorities, effectively enlarges the compliance conduit through which the government may abuse the rule of law.  Rather than separating compliance from legal, compliance should be subordinated to legal so that an officer accountable exclusively to the best interests of the firm is charged with interpreting the law and advising the firm on what the law requires.  Only after this determination has been made should compliance officers be charged with the task of executing on these decisions.  A necessary condition to realigning organizational responsibilities in this way, however, is for the government to stop insisting on the alternative.  More broadly, the government should not involve itself in the organizational details of compliance, but rather should limit itself to making and enforcing the law.",合规可以且经常充当监管机构和执法部门扩大其权力超越法定界限的渠道。这种可能性源于合规官员与监管机构之间的共生关系。合规官员的职业存在和组织权威完全依赖于监管者和执法者的干预。这形成了一种独特的激励机制，使得合规官员特别容易接受监管者的法外声明。因此，将合规与法务分离并将合规职能提升至与法务部门平级——这种监管机构和执法部门经常强推的结构——实际上扩大了政府可能滥用法治的合规渠道。与其将合规与法务分离，不如让合规隶属于法务，这样由一位仅对公司最佳利益负责的官员来负责解释法律并就法律要求向公司提供建议。只有在做出这一决定后，才应由合规官员负责执行这些决策。然而，以这种方式重新调整组织职责的必要前提是政府停止坚持另一种模式。更广泛地说，政府不应干预合规的组织细节，而应仅限于制定和执行法律。,"compliance, corporate governance, enforcement, regulation, ethics, legal, general counsel, chief compliance officer, rule of law, ethics officer, administrative procedure act, prosecutor",2019-10-11
compliance,TestingCompliance,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3777948,Brandon L. Garrett,"Corporations must comply with a dizzying array of laws and regulations. To accomplish this complex task, corporations increasingly turn not just to the legal department and outside counsel but also an in-house group composed of non-lawyer specialists who seek to educate and motivate personnel with respect to their obligations under the law and the corporation’s code of conduct. How can prosecutors, enforcers, companies, or the public know whether compliance is effective or merely cosmetic? In this Article, we argue that hope-based compliance — a mentality that leads insiders and outsiders to assess compliance programs by examining how many resources organizations are devoted to the effort and whether the programs appear well-intentioned or comply with accepted “best practices” within an industry — predictably arises from the incentives and practices evident under current laws. We describe the “compliance trap”: that efforts to validate compliance are not encouraged by enforcers or regulators. Such entities should want companies to share sound compliance practices to improve standards in industry. Individual companies, however, have incentives not to share information about compliance failures, lest they risk liability. Nor do companies have strong incentives to share information about compliance successes, lest competitors use their strategies too. Rather than address this problem, regulators and enforcers, as we will explore, have exacerbated it. We propose a set of legal reforms that would create the conditions for a move to evidence-based compliance. We describe a range of ways that companies can audit employees, using data analytics but also inexpensive and simple experimental approaches drawn from organizational psychology.

Yet, corporate compliance has remained relatively unaffected by technological change when compared to other industries. If firms continue to lag behind in their compliance efforts, their risk exposure to the potentially lethal sanctions associated with major compliance failures will continue to increase with time. This is particularly true in the context of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). Generally, the FCPA is a regulatory statute that forbids bribery and false accounting for domestic firms doing business abroad. And, in the past decade the DOJ and SEC have begun aggressively enforcing the FCPA. Firms should begin using technology to develop more robust and cost-efficient compliance programs in order to insulate themselves from the FCPA’s harsh penalties.This paper provides an algorithm that allows firms to evaluate and improve their compliance programs in accordance with several published sources of guidance. Compliance scholars have made clear that it is critical for firms to maintain strong corporate compliance programs and have suggested different models and frameworks for internal evaluation and auditing. However, those suggestions fail to consider how technology may be used to improve the cost-efficiency of corporate compliance & ethics programs.

Ultimately, boards, managers, and audit committees involved with strategy may benefit from focused compliance support to better identify the parts of the strategy toolkit that are higher risk than others, as well as the differences in risk by jurisdiction.

compliance,VATComplianceIncentives,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3531282,Maria-Augusta Miceli,"VAT compliance incentives are here studied through a game theoretical approach. Agents are explicitly assumed selfish and risk neutral. Compliance or evasion are a simple rational choice given tax parameters and the probability of audit. VAT evasion is a collusive conduct between the two counterparts of the transaction. While under no-audit the counterparts are generally keen to evade, even under a weak probability of audit they are both keen to comply. Therefore, they can form a coalition against the Tax Authority that is then forced to large and costly auditing. Under tax allowances to buyer specific invoiced expenses and no audit, this coalition breaks because the buyer prefers to comply and the seller to evade.In this work we compute the thresholds for tax policy parameters for the private coalition to be willing to comply as a determined trade-off versus auditing.The paper also enlighten the importance of the ratio costs/output values in the transaction. The larger the previous costs in a production chain, the smaller is the gain from VAT evasion. Therefore, for each fiscal parameter set, we can compute the threshold costs/output under which evasion is very likely and where therefore tax allowances can lead to compliance and, even if costly, they can lead to tax revenue increase.Although the policies are at work in some economies, we try to establish a method for tax design, able to make compliance the ""dominant strategy"", satisfying the ""outside option"" constraints against the various types of evasion, even in absence of audit and sanctions. The theoretical results derived here can be easily applied to real data.","本研究通过博弈论方法探讨增值税合规激励问题。在模型中，我们明确假设交易主体具有自私性且风险中性。根据税收参数与稽查概率，合规或逃税成为简单的理性选择。增值税逃税本质上是交易双方共谋行为：无稽查时双方普遍倾向于逃税，但即便面临微弱稽查概率，双方均会主动选择合规。因此交易双方可能形成对抗税务部门的联盟，迫使税务机关实施高成本的大规模稽查。当买方享有特定发票费用税收减免且无稽查时，该联盟将瓦解——此时买方倾向于合规而卖方倾向于逃税。本研究通过计算税收政策参数的临界值，揭示了私人联盟在稽查成本与合规收益间的权衡机制。研究还阐明了交易成本/产出价值比的关键作用：生产链前端成本越高，增值税逃税收益越小。因此针对任何财税参数组合，我们都能计算出逃税高发区的成本/产出临界值，证明税收减免既可引导合规，又能实现税收增长（即便存在政策成本）。尽管部分经济体已实施类似政策，我们试图建立一种能使合规成为""优势策略""的税制设计方法，在无稽查和制裁条件下，仍能满足对抗各类逃税行为的""外部选择""约束。本理论成果可便捷应用于实际数据分析。","Tax evasion, Tax design, Tax compliance, Tax fraud, VAT, Audit, Tax incentives, Fiscal Policy, Public Economics, Public Finance, Tax Induced, Mixed strategies game, Bayesian game.",2020-03-27

Our study has also established the relationship between stakeholders’ attributes and firms’ compliance with IFRS.Findings: On IFRS compliance, we found that the average compliance score among the companies over the period was 73.09% with a minimum score of 62.86% and maximum of 85.61%. We found a significant positive association between audit committee competence (ACC) and compliance and found the same for chartered accountants on board (AOB). There is less compliance with the latest standards, such as IFRS 3, 7, and 13. Also, IAS 17, 19, 36, and 37 are problematic across the sample. We also found that compliance has been increasing over the years.Practical implications: For companies, our studies provide empirical evidence on the importance of having chartered accountants’ corporate boards as well as competent audit committees involved in ensuring high compliance with IFRS. Our findings also provide valuable information for professional accounting organizations on the role of its members (chartered accountants) in the effectiveness of IFRS compliance.Value/Contribution: This study complements and updates prior studies on IFRS compliance with findings from Africa, a region that has been neglected in the literature.It provides empirical evidence on the importance of chartered accountants sitting on corporate boards in ensuring high compliance with IFRS.",目的：本文运用利益相关者显著性理论探讨企业遵守国际财务报告准则（IFRS）的驱动因素。研究方法：我们采用205家企业的面板数据，分析了13个非洲国家的IFRS合规水平，并建立了利益相关者属性与企业IFRS合规性之间的关系。研究发现：在IFRS合规方面，样本企业期间平均合规得分为73.09%，最低62.86%，最高85.61%。审计委员会专业能力（ACC）与合规性呈显著正相关，董事会特许会计师（AOB）同样呈现正向关联。企业对IFRS 3、7、13等新准则的遵循度较低，IAS 17、19、36和37在整个样本中执行难度较大。研究同时发现合规水平呈逐年上升趋势。实践启示：对企业而言，本研究实证证明了董事会配备特许会计师及专业审计委员会对提升IFRS合规性的重要作用。研究发现也为专业会计组织提供了其成员（特许会计师）在提升IFRS合规有效性方面作用的重要参考。价值贡献：本研究以被文献忽视的非洲地区数据补充更新了既有IFRS合规研究，实证揭示了企业董事会引入特许会计师对保障高水平IFRS合规的关键作用。,"Africa, Compliance, IFRS, Stakeholder salience",2019-11-11

Our laboratory tax compliance experiment, conducted in provinces of the northern and southern regions, reveal that taxpayers in the north and south generally behaved alike both in terms of average compliance rates and individuals’ sensitivity to changes in tax structures—except for lower responsiveness to greater redistribution of tax revenues among subjects in Salerno than those in Bologna.

A second set of issues concerns the interplay of compliance bodies with financial mechanisms and economic instruments created under MEAs in order to facilitate, respectively, developing and industrialized States in the achievement of their targets. These are, on one side, the funds created under MEAs or other financial institutions that facilitate the compliance of developing countries by providing them with financial assistance. While some of these funds are built on voluntary contributions, others may no longer be conceived as a form of “liberality” of developed countries towards poorer ones and a legal obligation to contribute to them may be foreseen. On the other side, in order to reduce the costs that industrialized countries bear to cut greenhouse gases emissions, flexibility mechanisms have been established by the Kyoto Protocol. These innovative financial instruments create an unforeseen implementation scenario, characterized by partnerships between developed and developing States and the establishment of a market, where a new environmental commodity is traded.","本文首先探讨了多边环境协定（MEAs）下合规机制的资金来源问题——这些资金往往不可预测且缺乏足够稳定性，并分析了由此产生的一系列问题。其次，研究聚焦于合规机构与MEA框架下两类金融工具的互动关系：一类是为协助发展中国家实现目标而设立的基金或金融机构，这些资金支持部分依赖自愿捐助，但某些基金可能将发达国家对贫困国家的出资从""慷慨援助""转变为法律义务；另一类是为降低工业化国家减排成本而设计的灵活机制，如《京都议定书》创设的创新金融工具，这些机制意外促成了发达国家与发展中国家间的合作模式，并催生了一个交易新型环境商品的市场体系。","environmental agreements, compliance, financial assistance, budget",2011-11-03
compliance,BoardCompliance,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3205600,John Armour,"What role do corporate boards play in compliance? Compliance programs are internal enforcement programs, whereby firms train, monitor and discipline employees with respect to applicable laws and regulations. Corporate enforcement and compliance failures could not be more high-profile, and have placed boards in the position of responding to systemic problems. Both case law on boards’ fiduciary duties and guidance from prosecutors suggest that the board should have a continuing role in overseeing compliance activity. Yet very little is actually known about the role of boards in compliance. This paper offers the first empirical account of public companies’ engagement with compliance at the board level, drawing on director-level data from BoardEx and data on federal organizational prosecutions from the Duke University and University of Virginia Corporate Prosecution Registry. We find that, despite a standard account that compliance has boomed, few boards actually adopt compliance committees. Less than five per cent of U.S. public companies have done so, although the proportion has grown steadily over time. We use our data to explore why boards establish compliance committees. Our results suggest that there is room for more constructive engagement with compliance by many boards. We conclude by recommending ways in which board compliance might be facilitated or encouraged: reconsidering norms about board size and independence, enhancing accountability of directors to regulators, and tightening state law fiduciary duties regarding oversight.",公司董事会在合规中扮演何种角色？合规计划是企业内部的执法机制，通过培训、监督与惩戒确保员工遵守法律法规。企业执法与合规失效问题备受瞩目，迫使董事会必须应对系统性风险。关于董事受托义务的判例法与检方指引均表明，董事会应持续监督合规活动。然而人们对董事会实际履职情况知之甚少。本文首次基于BoardEx的董事层级数据及杜克大学与弗吉尼亚大学企业诉讼登记库的联邦组织诉讼数据，实证研究上市公司董事会层面的合规实践。研究发现：尽管合规理念广为传播，但真正设立合规委员会的董事会寥寥无几——全美不足5%的上市公司采取此举，虽其比例正逐年缓升。我们通过数据探究董事会成立合规委员会的动因，结果表明多数董事会的合规参与度仍有提升空间。文末提出促进董事会合规的可行路径：重新审视董事会规模与独立性的规范标准、强化董事对监管机构的问责机制、以及收紧州法关于监督职责的受托义务要求。,"corporate law, compliance, corporate governance, compliance committees",2018-06-30

compliance,CriminalizedCompliance,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3818481,Todd Haugh,"Corporate compliance programs have become increasingly criminalized.  In the truest of ironies, companies have adopted compliance protocols that are motivated by and mimic application of the law they seek to avoid most.  This approach to compliance — using the precepts of criminal enforcement and adjudication to govern employee conduct — is inherently flawed, however, and can never be fully effective in abating corporate wrongdoing.  Criminalized compliance programs impose unintended behavioral consequences on employees, specifically by fostering rationalizations that allow would-be offenders to square their self-perception as “good people” with the unethical or illegal behavior they are contemplating, thereby allowing wrongdoing to go forward.  By importing into the corporation many of the criminal law’s delegitimizing features, criminalized compliance encourages rationalizations and creates the necessary precursors to the commission of corporate crime.  Once this dynamic is understood, it provides a new way of conceptualizing corporate compliance and explains the ineffectiveness of many “leading” compliance programs.  It also suggests that companies committed to making gains in ethics and compliance should often ignore the practices of their peers and the regulators that influence them, and instead design behaviorally cognizant strategies aimed at combating individual and organizational rationalizations.","企业合规计划正日益被刑事化。最具讽刺意味的是，公司采用的合规方案恰恰源于并效仿了他们最想规避的法律应用。这种以刑事执法和审判原则来约束员工行为的合规模式存在根本缺陷，永远无法有效遏制企业不当行为。刑事化的合规计划会对员工产生非预期的行为后果——具体而言，它会催生心理合理化机制，使潜在违规者在保持""好人""自我认知的同时，为其正在考虑的不道德或非法行为开脱，从而纵容不当行为的发生。当合规计划移植了刑法诸多去正当化的特征时，就会助长合理化思维，为企业犯罪创造条件。理解这一机制后，我们就能以全新视角审视企业合规，并解释诸多""标杆""合规计划失效的原因。这也意味着，真正致力于提升道德与合规水平的企业，往往需要摒弃同行及监管机构的常规做法，转而设计具有行为认知特性的策略，以阻断个人与组织的合理化借口。","corporate compliance, corporations, criminal law, corporate law, behavioral ethics, organizations, organizational legitimacy, business ethics, white collar crime, rationalizations, criminology, corporate prosecutions, behavioral psychology, behavioral economics",2021-05-07

This article advocates that at the macro level, the competent authorities should adopt a holistic approach regarding the efforts made by the companies for compliance with the competition law and anti-corruption laws and both should be subject to a unified legal enforcement policy concerning interacting compliance programmes. Furthermore, we argue that both anti-corruption and competition law compliance programmes should be considered by regulators and the Courts as mitigating factors in determining fines and sanctions for violating companies. This would encourage companies to develop thorough compliance programmes that go beyond mere legal compliance and additionally address behaviour, assist them in identifying and accumulating best practices over the years. In doing so, the impact and reach of regulation and legislation will increase; ultimately improving market efficiency. Such a broad scale upgrade in sanctions policy would eventually be of benefit to society and the economy in terms of both crime prevention and the procedural economy.",无论是出于道德原因、罚款及其他制裁的威慑作用，还是两者兼有，越来越多的公司在制定企业治理政策框架时，将遵守反腐败法规与竞争法合规协同推进。本文主张在宏观层面，主管部门应对企业遵守竞争法与反腐败法的努力采取整体性视角，并将两者纳入关于互动合规计划的统一执法政策。此外，我们认为监管机构和法院在判定违规企业罚款与制裁时，应将反腐败和竞争法合规计划视为减轻处罚的因素。这将促使企业制定全面的合规计划——不仅满足法律要求，更能规范行为，并帮助其识别和积累多年来的最佳实践。通过这种方式，法规与立法的影响力和覆盖范围将得到提升，最终提高市场效率。这种制裁政策的大规模升级，最终将在犯罪预防和程序经济两方面为社会和经济带来益处。,"compliance, competition law, antitrust, anti-corruption",2019-01-06
compliance,TheComplianceMentorship Program: Improving Ethics andCompliancein Small Government Contractors,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3559458,Jessica Tillipman,"Over the past decade, the anti-corruption, ethics, and compliance landscape has changed dramatically. This is a direct consequence of a global anti-corruption enforcement effort led by the United States through its enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The increase in enforcement has also been spurred by the adoption of several multilateral anti-corruption agreements, such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Anti-Bribery Convention and the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC).  These agreements have spurred several countries to enact anti-corruption laws, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, Brazil’s Clean Company Act, and France’s Loi Sapin II. The laws prohibit, among other things, the bribery of foreign government officials. They also encourage companies to dedicate resources to developing anti-corruption compliance programs and maintaining robust internal controls.The increase in anti-corruption enforcement has profoundly impacted large, multinational corporations. Many of these companies have responded to the enforcement increase by investing heavily in sophisticated compliance programs designed to prevent or mitigate liability for anti-corruption violations. The development of rigorous internal compliance programs has been particularly pronounced in the defense industry, especially among large, U.S. defense contractors.Unlike their large counterparts, many small government contractors are largely unable to keep up with the rapidly evolving trends and best practices in ethics and compliance. Their inattention to this critical area leaves them at risk for compliance failures, fraud, and corruption. As a result, small contractors are more likely than their large counterparts to be debarred from the U.S. procurement system.Despite the harsh consequences of compliance deficiencies, few small contractors are likely to dedicate resources to the development of vital compliance policies and internal controls because of the reality of limited resources. This has created a critical gap in the defense industry supply chain, as many large contractors may partner with small companies that lack the sophistication and resources necessary to ensure compliance with the many government contracts compliance requirements.One solution to this growing problem is to incentivize large government contractors to help their small subcontractors develop compliance programs. The incentives, of course, must be substantial enough to convince large contractors to share their confidential and proprietary compliance programs and best practices.Fortunately, a model for this type of arrangement exists in the U.S. procurement system. The “mentor-protégé” program is designed to help small businesses navigate the immense government contracts regulatory system.Under this program, generally a larger, more experienced contractor serves as a “mentor” to a smaller contractor (the “protégé”). The mentor, among other things, guides the protégé through the complex procurement regime by sharing expertise and resources. In return, the mentor is provided with contractual opportunities and incentives by the U.S. Government.This model could benefit companies in the compliance space by providing a mechanism for contracting parties to exchange information and ensure transparency throughout all levels of the procurement process.This article recommends incentivizing large businesses to utilize their vast resources to assist their small business partners with the development of internal ethics and compliance programs in order to improve the overall integrity of the government procurement system. It analyzes the development of global anti-corruption compliance standards through an overview of noteworthy changes in laws, regulations and enforcement, as well as the current compliance risks that large companies face when contracting with smaller companies who lack robust compliance systems and internal controls. The article concludes by recommending  the adoption of a corporate mentor-protégé program that incentivizes larger companies to dedicate resources to helping smaller contractors develop anti-corruption compliance programs.","过去十年间，反腐败、道德规范与合规领域发生了翻天覆地的变化。这直接源于美国通过《反海外腐败法》执法引领的全球反腐行动。多项多边反腐协议的出台也推动了执法力度加强，例如经济合作与发展组织《反贿赂公约》和《联合国反腐败公约》。这些协议促使英国《反贿赂法》、巴西《清洁公司法》、法国《萨潘第二法案》等国家立法相继颁布。这些法律不仅明令禁止贿赂外国政府官员，更推动企业投入资源建立反腐合规体系与完善内控制度。. . 反腐执法强化对大型跨国企业影响深远。许多公司通过重金打造精密合规体系来应对，旨在预防或减轻违规责任。这种严格的内部合规机制在国防工业领域尤为突出，美国大型国防承包商表现最为显著。. . 与巨头企业形成鲜明对比的是，众多小型政府承包商难以跟上合规领域快速演进的最佳实践。对这一关键领域的忽视使其面临合规失效、欺诈与腐败风险。因此小型承包商相比大企业更可能被美国采购体系拒之门外。. . 尽管合规缺陷后果严重，但资源有限的现实使小型承包商很少投入资源建立关键合规政策与内控体系。这在国防工业供应链中形成了重大缺口——大型承包商常需与缺乏合规能力的小企业合作。. . 解决这一日益严峻问题的方案，是激励大型政府承包商协助小型分包商建立合规体系。当然，激励措施必须足够有力，才能说服大企业分享其机密专属的合规方案与最佳实践。. . 值得庆幸的是，美国采购体系中的""导师-门生""计划为此提供了范本。该计划旨在帮助小企业应对庞杂的政府合同监管体系。通常由经验丰富的大型承包商担任""导师""，通过分享专业知识与资源指导""门生""企业穿越复杂采购体系，作为回报，美国政府会为导师企业提供合同机会与政策激励。. . 这种模式可为合规领域提供新思路，建立合同方信息交换机制，确保采购流程各环节透明度。本文建议激励大企业运用其雄厚资源，协助小企业合作伙伴建立道德合规体系，从而提升政府采购体系的整体廉洁度。通过梳理法律法规与执法实践的重大变革，分析全球反腐合规标准的发展脉络，揭示大企业与缺乏健全合规体系的小公司合作时面临的风险。最终提出应推行企业版""导师-门生""计划，激励大企业投入资源帮助小承包商建设反腐合规体系。","procurement, government contracts, contractor, compliance, foreign corrupt practices act, FCPA, United Nations, OECD, bribery, corruption, anti-corruption, UNCAC, UK Bribery Act, Sapin II, defense, defense contractor, fraud, supply chain, ethics, anti-bribery",2020-03-27

compliance,StateCompliancewith International law in Intelligence Matters: A Behavioural Approach,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3955061,Sophie Duroy,"Decision-making in intelligence matters is often assumed to be an extra-legal process. This article however shows that the determining factor in compliance is a legal one: the likelihood of the state being held effectively accountable for a breach of international law. Through a behavioural analysis of state conduct in intelligence matters and the modelling of intelligence decision-making, the article demonstrates that state behaviour in intelligence matters can be explained and predicted. Taking compliance as the standard for assessing the effectiveness of regulation, this finding has strategic implications for the actors of the international legal order attempting to enhance compliance. Specifically, increasing the likelihood of effective accountability increases the probability of compliance and decreases the weight given to extra-legal and domestic considerations in decision-making, regardless of the activity and state considered. Hence, rather than focussing on the regulatory framework itself (international law), regulatory approaches aiming to enhance compliance should focus on improving accountability.",情报事务中的决策常被视为法外过程。然而本文揭示，合规性的决定性因素在于法律层面：即国家违反国际法后是否可能被有效追责。通过对国家情报行为的行为学分析及决策建模，文章论证了国家在情报事务中的行为可被解释与预测。以合规性作为评估监管效力的标准，这一发现对试图提升合规性的国际法律秩序参与者具有战略意义。具体而言，提高有效追责的可能性会增强合规概率，同时降低决策中对法外因素及国内考量的权重，无论涉及何种活动或国家。因此，旨在加强合规性的监管路径不应聚焦于监管框架本身（国际法），而应着力完善追责机制。,"intelligence, accountability, compliance, behavioural analysis, decision-making, regulation",2021-12-27

It provides a critical analysis of statements made by price fixers, their competition lawyers and in-house counsel involved in cartel cases. The study draws on a combination of publicly available statements and anonymised accounts collected over 15 years of engaging with each of these three groups. It concludes that those responsible for cartels are motivated by varying factors and do not necessarily understand or accept that cartel behaviour is wrongful. Also, disciplining those individuals is complicated by the incentives created through leniency and settlement programmes. These findings highlight the importance of continued investment in compliance and the broader need for education in competition law to make it less likely that infringements will occur in the first place.",本文通过探讨价格操纵者违反竞争法的视角，填补了反垄断合规文献的重要空白。文章对价格操纵者、其竞争法律师以及参与卡特尔案件的企业内部法律顾问的陈述进行了批判性分析。研究综合运用了公开声明与十五年来从这三个群体收集的匿名记录。研究表明，卡特尔行为的责任者受多种因素驱动，未必理解或承认卡特尔行为的错误性。此外，宽大处理与和解计划产生的激励机制使得对这些个人的惩戒变得复杂。这些发现凸显了持续加强合规投入的重要性，以及更广泛开展竞争法教育的必要性，从而从源头上减少侵权行为的发生。,"Competition Law, Antitrust, Compliance, Cartels",2021-05-25

Non-state actors are proven enforcers – sometimes more effective than states. Climate cases brought by non-state actors to non-climate institutions help to demonstrate this point, and effective mechanisms for non-state access to compliance are modeled within multilateral environmental agreements ranging from Aarhus to NAFTA. The author argues that the role of non-state actors should be expanded as climate change frameworks evolve and compliance mechanisms are strengthened. Leaving the public without standing within formal enforcement mechanisms misses a critical opportunity to promote compliance.",本章探讨了非国家行为体在促进气候变化协议遵守方面的作用，发现其贡献巨大。事实证明，非国家行为体是有效的执行者——有时比国家更有效。非国家行为体向非气候机构提起的气候诉讼案例有助于证明这一点，从《奥胡斯公约》到《北美自由贸易协定》等多边环境协定中，都建立了非国家行为体参与合规的有效机制。作者认为，随着气候变化框架的演进和合规机制的强化，应扩大非国家行为体的作用。若公众无法在正式执行机制中发挥作用，将错失促进合规的关键机会。,"Climate Change, Compliance, Non-State Actors, Climate Governance, International Environmental Law, Public Participation, Copenhagen, Kyoto Protocol, Non-Governmental Organization, NGO",2011-04-10

The idea that corporations should engage in socially responsible business practices (“CSR”) or initiatives relating to environmental, social, and governance matters (“ESG”) is gaining prominence, but remains highly contested. Deeper examination reveals that these terms—CSR and ESG—each lack a singular meaning. From aligning shareholder and stakeholder interests for shared value and risk management, to going beyond compliance and profit-maximizing strategies, there is no consensus on what socially-responsible activity entails and the rationale for its pursuit.This chapter aims to illuminate the landscape of CSR, ESG, and their connection to compliance. Varying usage and mixed empirical research reveals that CSR and ESG lack a clearly defined connection to compliance. This indeterminacy extends to (1) whether CSR and ESG are correlated with or refer to greater levels of legal compliance, as well as (2) what it means for a corporation to “comply” with CSR or ESG goals in light of the proliferation of standards and metrics pertaining to sustainability and social impact.

Our experimental results show that overall taxpayer compliance declines in the presence of a collusively corrupt tax auditor who accepts bribes that leave the taxpayer economically better off. In contrast, taxpayer compliance increases in the presence of coercive tax auditors who demand moderate bribes. This may reflect taxpayers’ attempt to create a moral distance between themselves and the corrupt auditor. However, such economic sacrifices disappear when the level of bribe demanded by coercive auditors is increased to a higher component of reported income, suggesting that taxpayers may be willing to bear only relatively modest costs to morally differentiate themselves from coercive tax auditors.",本研究探讨了存在与不存在共谋腐败税务稽查员时的纳税人遵从行为，并将其与存在及不存在胁迫型腐败税务稽查员时的遵从情况进行比较。实验结果表明：当存在接受贿赂并使纳税人经济获益的共谋型腐败稽查员时，总体纳税人遵从度会下降；相反，面对索取适度贿赂的胁迫型稽查员时，纳税人遵从度反而上升。这可能反映了纳税人试图与腐败稽查员保持道德距离的心理。然而，当胁迫型稽查员索贿金额增至申报收入的较高比例时，这种经济牺牲行为便随之消失，这表明纳税人可能只愿意承担相对有限的成本来与胁迫型税务稽查员划清道德界限。,"Collusive corrupt, Coercive corruption, Tax auditors, Tax compliance",2021-11-18
compliance,ComplianceDynamism: Capturing the Polynormative and Situational Nature of Business Responses to Law,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3563099,Yunmei Wu,"Studying compliance, in terms of the business responses to legal rules, is notoriously difficult. This paper focuses on the difficulty of capturing the behavioral response itself, rather than on difficulties in explaining compliance and isolating par- ticular factors of influence on it. The paper argues that existing approaches to capture such compliance, using surveys and governmental data, run the risk of failing to capture compliance as it occurs in the reality of day-to-day business responses to the law. It does so by means of a unique ethnographic approach to study compliance. Drawing from data of deep participant observation about responses to legal rules in two small businesses, the paper finds that in this context there is Compliance Dynamism. This means that compliance varies for different rules, it varies over time, and businesses learn from one response to the law to the next on a daily basis. Compliance is also situational, and there is an Indirect Observer Effect, where the way compliance is measured, especially when using data derived from inspections, shapes what compliance is observed and what is not. Therefore, compliance should be captured not as a singular state but as a string of reiterative processes that occur in their situational context. And this fundamentally challenges most existing methods to capture compliance and thus our understanding of what compliance occurs and what may shape it. In its conclusion, the paper draws out the implications this has for studies that seek to find simple and usable findings about compliance.","研究企业在面对法律规则时的合规行为，其难度众所周知。本文聚焦于捕捉行为反应本身的困难，而非解释合规或分离特定影响因素的难题。文章指出，现有通过调查和政府数据来捕捉合规行为的方法，可能无法真实反映企业在日常经营中对法律的实际响应。为此，本研究采用独特的人种志方法展开分析。通过对两家小微企业法律响应行为的深度参与式观察，研究发现存在""合规动态性""现象——即企业对不同规则的合规程度存在差异，这种差异会随时间变化，且企业会在日常法律应对中持续积累经验。合规还具有情境依赖性，并存在""间接观察者效应""：尤其是采用检查数据时，测量方式本身会决定哪些合规行为被观察到。因此，合规应被视为情境中一系列反复发生的动态过程，而非单一静态结果。这一发现从根本上挑战了现有主流研究方法，也重塑了我们对合规行为及其影响机制的理解。文末探讨了该结论对追求简明实用成果的合规研究带来的启示。","compliance, methods, ethnography, white collar crime, regulatory enforcement",2020-04-14

Its positive role related to profit maximization or market share is apparent and it is also to the success of some of its specific programs, as its compliance program.It is less evident, instead, why innovation, in the former sense (referred to the general aims of the organization) should be included on the code of ethics, being that code a cornerstone of the compliance program, whose aims were utterly different.Nonetheless, that inclusion is correct. The program of compliance, as a condition of efficiency, must be consistent with the general and ultimate aims of the organization. Moreover, it must not be even “neutral” to those aims, but positively functional.A second order but relevant remark may be made. Formal appellations to innovation may bias to fancy software or hardware technology over innovative organizational processes even if the latter are more efficient.

compliance,ShariahComplianceand Corporate Cash Holdings,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3581440,Abdullah Salem Bugshan,"This study investigates the influence of shariah compliance status on firms’ cash holding levels and speed of adjustment in non-financial firms listed in six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC countries) from 2005 to 2016. It shows that shariah compliance status has a significant effect on firms’ cash holding decisions. Shariah-compliant firms have significantly higher cash holding levels than non-shariah-compliant firms. Further, shariah-compliant firms adjust more quickly to their target cash holdings than do their conventional counterparts. In our view, shariah-compliant firms are subject to multiple restrictions that limit their external financing channels; therefore, holding larger cash reserves is important as such firms are financially constrained and gain from the transaction cost motive of holding cash. The findings of the study have important implications for regulators, investors and managers.

compliance,"The ""Wholesale Failure"" of the SEC's Approach to ChiefComplianceOfficer Liability",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5094605,David Lourie,"Chief Compliance Officers (“CCOs”) at financial services firms are essential in ensuring that the approximately 15,000 SEC-registered firms, including investment advisers, broker-dealers, and private funds, comply with federal securities laws.  These firms collectively manage over $114 trillion in assets for investors and are the “lifeblood” of the U.S. economy.  The CCO position is so crucial to regulators that CCOs can and have been held personally liable for compliance violations of their firms, even when the CCO was not involved in the misconduct, which has caused negative consequences.Significantly and problematically, the SEC has not promulgated a legal standard for when CCOs may be held personally liable for violations committed by their firms, and their attempts to clarify the factors that would put a CCO in danger of liability have only added to the confusion.  This paper proposes a recklessness legal standard for when CCOs are to be held personally liable for violations committed by their firms and demonstrates that this standard will benefit CCOs, firms, and regulators.This paper takes a unique approach, not just rehashing existing ideas but utilizing cutting-edge research from organizational studies, compliance, behavioral studies, and information from legal authorities to demonstrate what creates strong organizational cultures that prevent unlawful behavior.  These studies feed into the legal standard I propose, demonstrating that it will promote the appropriate incentivizes to meet the SEC’s regulatory goals of protecting investors and ensuring fair and efficient markets, rather than the current problematic incentives for a CCO to create an ineffective, check-the-box, reactionary compliance program to protect themselves from liability.  This legal standard will also remedy other negative consequences of the SEC’s approach, such as the chilling effect on knowledgeable and competent CCOs and reflects both the modern realities of the CCO position and what research shows is required to build strong organizational compliance cultures.This paper has significant and timely implications for compliance, securities and legal scholarship more broadly.  First, as the conscience of firms managing trillions in assets on behalf of investors, including individuals, pensions, and universities, CCOs play an integral role in promoting behavior that protects these investors and promulgating the legal standard proposed will benefit these investors and the U.S. economy.  Second, this paper applies novel research regarding the ex-ante function of law, where CCOs and other organizational actors must take proactive, preventative actions to ensure violations do not occur in the first place.  The far majority of legal scholarship focuses on the ex-post function of law, where the legal system responds to past behavior; however, such an approach is ineffective in promoting an organizational culture of compliance, which has important consequences for organizations across industries.","金融服务公司的首席合规官（“CCOs”）对于确保约15,000家在SEC注册的公司（包括投资顾问、经纪自营商和私募基金）遵守联邦证券法至关重要。这些公司共同为投资者管理着超过114万亿美元的资产，是美国经济的“命脉”。首席合规官职位对监管机构如此重要，以至于首席合规官可能且已经因其公司的合规违规行为而承担个人责任，即使首席合规官并未参与不当行为，这已造成负面影响。. . 值得注意的是且成问题的是，SEC并未就首席合规官何时可能因其公司的违规行为承担个人责任颁布法律标准，其试图澄清可能导致首席合规官面临责任风险的因素反而增加了困惑。本文提出了一种“轻率”法律标准，用于判定首席合规官何时应因其公司的违规行为承担个人责任，并证明该标准将使首席合规官、公司和监管机构受益。. . 本文采用了一种独特的方法，不仅重复现有观点，还利用组织研究、合规、行为研究的前沿成果以及法律权威信息，展示了如何建立防止非法行为的强大组织文化。这些研究支持了我提出的法律标准，表明它将促进适当的激励，以实现SEC保护投资者和确保市场公平高效的监管目标，而不是当前有问题的激励——首席合规官为规避责任而建立无效的、走过场的、被动反应的合规计划。该法律标准还将纠正SEC方法的其他负面影响，例如对知识渊博且称职的首席合规官的寒蝉效应，并反映了首席合规官职位的现代现实以及研究显示的建立强大组织合规文化所需的条件。. . 本文对合规、证券和更广泛的法律学术具有重要且及时的意义。首先，作为代表个人、养老金和大学等投资者管理数万亿美元资产的公司“良心”，首席合规官在促进行为保护这些投资者方面发挥着不可或缺的作用，颁布拟议的法律标准将使这些投资者和美国经济受益。其次，本文应用了关于法律事前功能的新研究，即首席合规官和其他组织参与者必须采取主动的预防性行动，以确保违规行为从一开始就不会发生。绝大多数法律学术研究都集中在法律的事后功能上，即法律体系对过去行为的反应；然而，这种方法在促进合规的组织文化方面效果不佳，这对各行业的组织具有重要影响。","Compliance, SEC, Securities, Organizational Studies, Chief Compliance Officer, Financial Regulation, Business Organizations, Supervision, Liability Standard, Regulatory Enforcement, Corporate Governance",2025-01-14

These efforts are occurring quickly, without great confidence in their efficacy. Thus the interest in culture. This article explores what a culture of compliance means and why it is so hard to achieve. The ""dark side"" that enables non-compliance in organizations is powerful and often hidden from view, working via scripts that rationalize or normalize, denigrations of regulation, and celebrations of beliefs and attitudes that bring with them compliance dangers.

compliance,ComplianceManagement Systems: Do They Make a Difference?,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3598264,Cary Coglianese,"Regulatory compliance is vital for promoting the public values served by regulation. Yet many businesses remain out of compliance with some of the regulations that apply to them — presenting not only possible dangers to the public but also exposing themselves to potentially significant liability risk. Compliance management systems (CMSs) may help reduce the likelihood of noncompliance. In recent years, managers have begun using CMSs in an effort to address compliance issues in a variety of domains: environment, workplace health and safety, finance, health care, and aviation, among others. CMSs establish systematic, checklist-like processes by which managers seek to improve their organizations’ compliance with government regulation. They can help managers identify compliance obligations, assign responsibility for meeting them, track progress, and take corrective action as needed. In effect, CMSs constitute firms’ own internal inspection and enforcement responsibilities. At least in theory, CMSs reduce noncompliance by increasing information available to employees and managers, facilitating internal incentives to correct instances of noncompliance once identified, and helping to foster a culture of compliance. Recognizing these potential benefits, some government policymakers and regulators have even started to require certain firms to adopt CMSs.But do CMSs actually achieve their theoretical benefits? We review the available empirical research related to CMSs in an effort to discern how they work, paying particular attention to whether CMSs help firms fulfill both the letter as well as the spirit of the law. We also consider lessons that can be drawn from research on the effectiveness of still broader systems for risk management and corporate codes of ethics, as these systems either include regulatory compliance as one component or they present comparable challenges in terms of internal monitoring and shaping of organizational behavior. Overall, we find evidence that firms with certain types of CMSs in place experience fewer compliance violations and show improvements in risk management. But these effects also appear to be rather modest. Compliance in large organizations generally requires more than just a CMS; it also demands appropriate managerial attitudes, organizational cultures, and information technologies that extend beyond the systematic, checklist processes characteristic of CMSs. We address implications of what we find for policy and future research, especially about the conditions under which CMSs appear to work best, the types or features of CMSs that appear to work better than others, and the possible value of regulatory mandates that firms implement CMSs.",监管合规对于促进法规所服务的公共价值至关重要。然而许多企业仍未能完全遵守适用于它们的部分法规——这不仅可能对公众构成危害，也使企业自身面临重大的责任风险。合规管理体系（CMS）或有助于降低违规概率。近年来，管理者开始在各领域运用CMS应对合规问题，包括环境、职场健康安全、金融、医疗保健及航空等。CMS通过建立系统化、清单式的流程，帮助管理者提升组织对政府法规的遵从度。它们能协助管理者识别合规义务、分配责任、追踪进度，并在必要时采取纠正措施。实质上，CMS构成了企业内部的检查与执行机制。理论上，CMS通过增加员工和管理者可获取的信息、强化违规行为的内部整改激励、培育合规文化来减少违规行为。鉴于这些潜在效益，部分政府政策制定者和监管机构已开始强制要求特定企业实施CMS。. . 但CMS是否真能实现其理论效益？我们梳理了相关实证研究以探究其运作机制，重点关注CMS能否帮助企业同时实现法律条文与立法精神的遵守。我们还借鉴了更广泛的风险管理体系和企业道德规范有效性的研究经验，因为这些体系要么将监管合规作为组成部分，要么在内部监控和组织行为塑造方面面临类似挑战。总体而言，我们发现证据表明采用特定类型CMS的企业违规行为更少，风险管理水平有所提升。但这些效果似乎较为有限。大型组织的合规通常不仅需要CMS，还需匹配的管理者态度、组织文化及信息技术支持，这些要素超越了CMS典型的系统化清单流程特征。我们探讨了研究发现对政策及未来研究的启示，特别是CMS最有效运作的条件、表现更优的CMS类型或特征，以及强制企业实施CMS的法规可能产生的价值。,"Regulatory compliance, administrative regulations, compliance programs, enterprise risk management, risk control, organizational behavior, corporate behavioral change, corporate codes of ethics, rule of law, systems engineering, organizational cultures",2020-05-11

compliance,TestingCompliance,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3535913,Brandon L. Garrett,"Corporations must comply with a dizzying array of laws and regulations.  To accomplish this complex task, corporations increasingly turn not just to the legal department and outside counsel but also an in-house group composed of non-lawyer specialists who seek to educate and motivate personnel with respect to their obligations under the law and the corporation’s code of conduct.  How can prosecutors, enforcers, companies, or the public know whether compliance is effective or merely cosmetic?  In this Article, we argue that hope-based compliance — a mentality that leads insiders and outsiders to assess compliance programs by examining how many resources are devoted to the effort and whether the programs appear sensible and well-intentioned — predictably arises from the incentives and practices evident under current laws.   We describe the “compliance trap”: that efforts to validate compliance are not encouraged by enforcers or regulators.  Such entities should want companies to share sound compliance practices to improve standards in industry.  Individual companies, however, have incentives not to share information about compliance failures, lest they risk liability. Nor do companies have strong incentives to share information about compliance successes, lest competitors use their strategies too. Rather than address this problem, regulators and enforcers, as we will explore, have exacerbated it. We propose a set of legal reforms that would create the conditions for a move to evidence-based compliance.  We describe a range of ways that companies can audit employees, using data analytics but also inexpensive and simple experimental approaches drawn from organizational psychology.  We call for a scientific approach towards regulating compliance through testing, in which compliance data must be made public, and empirically validated.","企业必须遵守纷繁复杂的法律法规。为完成这一复杂任务，企业不仅越来越多地依赖法务部门和外部律师，还组建了由非律师专业人士组成的内部团队，致力于教育员工并督促其履行法律义务和企业行为准则。检察官、执法机构、企业或公众如何判断合规工作是切实有效还是流于表面？本文提出，""基于期望的合规""——这种思维模式使得内外部人员通过评估投入资源多寡及项目是否合理善意来衡量合规成效——实则是现行法律下激励机制与实践催生的必然结果。我们揭示了""合规陷阱""：执法与监管机构并未鼓励企业验证合规实效。这些机构本应希望企业分享优质合规实践以提升行业标准。但单个企业既无动力公开合规失败（以免招致责任），也缺乏分享成功经验的意愿（以防竞争对手效仿）。而正如我们将探讨的，监管者与执法者非但未解决这一问题，反而加剧了困境。我们提出一系列法律改革方案，为转向""基于实证的合规""创造条件，并列举了企业运用数据分析及组织心理学中简便实验方法审计员工行为的多重途径。我们主张通过测试推行合规监管的科学方法，要求公开合规数据并进行实证验证。","compliance, testing, validation, corporate crime",2020-03-08

compliance,Legalization and Norm Internalization: An Empirical Study of International Human Rights Commitments Eliciting Public Support forCompliance,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3596938,Matthew Dale Kim,"Past studies argue that states abide by international human rights laws because the ratification of human rights treaties elicits public demand for compliance. Yet, the extent to which human rights treaties affect public support for compliance is unclear. At times, legalization of norms seems to elicit substantial public support for compliance, but at other times, legalization seems to have little effect. This study incorporates the life cycle of norms to arrive at a deeper understanding of the conditions in which international legal commitments to human rights generate public support for compliance with human rights norms. Using a series of survey experiments, this study finds that the effect of legalization on public support depends on the internalization of the norm itself. When a norm is emerging, legalization garners greater public support. When the norm is internalized, legalization does not always generate greater public support. In a sense, state commitment and norm internalization have substitutable effects on eliciting public support for compliance. This study also uses text analysis to explore the causal mechanisms through which international law causes greater public support for compliance. Laws of high obligation elicit public support by generating concerns over the state’s reputation, regardless of the norm’s life cycle. These findings suggest that policymakers and human rights advocates hoping to elicit greater public support for compliance with human rights norms should invest their political capital and financial resources on legalizing emerging norms.",以往研究认为，国家遵守国际人权法是因为人权条约的批准会引发公众对履约的要求。然而，人权条约在多大程度上影响公众对履约的支持尚不明确。有时，规范的法制化似乎能获得公众对履约的大力支持，但另一些时候，法制化似乎收效甚微。本研究引入规范的生命周期理论，以深入理解国际人权法律承诺在何种条件下能激发公众对人权规范的履约支持。通过一系列调查实验，本研究发现法制化对公众支持的影响取决于规范本身的内化程度。当规范处于萌芽阶段时，法制化能获得更多公众支持；当规范已被内化时，法制化并不总能带来更强的公众支持。从某种意义上说，国家承诺与规范内化在激发公众履约支持方面具有替代效应。本研究还通过文本分析探讨了国际法促使公众更支持履约的因果机制：高义务性法律通过引发对国家声誉的关切来获得公众支持，这与规范的生命周期无关。这些发现表明，政策制定者和人权倡导者若希望获得公众对人权规范履约的更大支持，应将政治资本和财政资源投入到新兴规范的法制化进程中。,"norm internalization, human rights, international law, compliance",2020-05-11

compliance,TeachingCompliance,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2616884,D. Daniel Sokol,"Compliance is a growing field of practice across multiple areas of law. Increasingly companies put compliance risk among the most important corporate governance issues facing them. Moreover, as “JD plus” jobs proliferate, the demand for hiring both at the entry level and for former students currently in practice who are experienced in the compliance field will continue to grow. The growth in compliance jobs comes at a time in shifting demand for legal jobs for law school graduates. Traditional law firm entry level jobs at large law firms, which were the staple of on campus recruiting before 2007, have not returned to pre-2007 levels even with the end of the recession. Technological changes, greater in-house hiring, and better creation of efficiencies have reduced demand for large law firms, which were the traditional training ground for in-depth legal skills and soft skills. Law schools have responded to the demand shift in entry level hiring with a supply side response – classes in compliance. In some cases, law schools have set up compliance certificates or degrees in areas such as health care and business law. There is now even a casebook devoted to compliance. Yet, with all of these efforts at creating opportunities for careers in compliance, many programs and classes in compliance are nothing other than dressed up versions of classes in white collar crime or regulation or lectures on latest case developments that one might find in a continuing legal education program. These courses do not focus on the substantive areas needs practice with the highest demand for compliance (in-house legal and JD plus jobs) and do not teach the analytical skills necessary to succeed in such jobs. Nor do they focus on the special context within which compliance operates – ideally independent of the “business” but always a part of it. Essentially, law schools have misdiagnosed the demand side – it is not merely the particular type of class (compliance) but also the substance of such classes with the type of quality offering necessary to maximize student short term (entry level hiring) and long term (preparation for ever-shifting analytically complex practice challenges). This Essay suggests an alternative approach to teaching compliance – one that focuses on the design and implementation of compliance programs. The Essay explores the determinants of why teaching compliance is important, the pitfalls of current approaches and the types of teaching innovations that sophisticated compliance practice requires. First, it explains what compliance is. Then, it explains the basis for the current economic drivers of the increased focus on compliance by firms. Next, it identifies the drivers of illegality before explaining how law school and in-house compliance training might be better structured in both analytical approach and substance.

It will examine the posture of compliance officers in three contexts: i) as a possible target for enforcement activity by regulators; ii) as a quasi-professional subject to a current regime of “non-regulation”; and iii) as an employee in need of ample whistleblower protections, each of which create implications for a compliance officer’s risk of personal liability and protections as a constituent of the organization monitored. After considering the current guidance surrounding enforcement activity against chief compliance officers by regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), this Article will examine the lack of professional regulation of compliance officers and the various ways in which this poses liability risks, especially in instances where a compliance officer’s work overlaps with that of other regulated professions.

Internal compliance programmes are thought to protect firms by training employees and auditing their activities. However, this paper argues that such programmes are ineffective because cartelists typically know what they are doing is illegal, go to great lengths to avoid detection and are usually senior managers. Moreover, compliance programmes do not mitigate cartel fines, despite their being imposed on the whole corporation years after an infringement has occurred. It is argued that the threat of criminal sanctions against individuals is essential to effective internal compliance.",卡特尔行为会招致巨额企业罚款，即便仅涉及少数员工。内部合规计划被认为能通过培训员工和审计其活动来保护企业。然而，本文认为此类计划效果有限，因为卡特尔操纵者通常明知行为违法，会极力规避侦查，且多为高层管理人员。此外，尽管违规行为发生数年后才对整个公司实施处罚，合规计划也未能减轻卡特尔罚款。研究指出，对个人实施刑事制裁的威胁才是确保内部合规有效的关键。,"Competition Law, Antitrust Compliance, Cartels, Article 81",2009-07-12
compliance,Is it Possible to MeasureCompliance?,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=935988,Vibeke Lehmann Nielsen,"One of the main challenges in much empirical study of regulation is to measure the level of compliance with the law. Measuring an individual's or an organization's compliance with the law, however, is always difficult. The two main sets of uncertainty in interpreting and relying on measures of compliance are: Firstly, there is a problem with collecting accurate information about the level of violations of the law committed by a person or an organization. This is a problem because the relevant information has not, and/or cannot, be collected. Secondly, given that 'actual compliance' may be impossible to measure directly (because of the first set of problems), the problem is to establish what link, if any there is between 'actual compliance' and other measures that we hypothesize are related to actual compliance and that we might be able to use as proxies for actual compliance. This paper critically analyses the strengths and weaknesses of different ways of measuring compliance by reference to the different conceptualizations of compliance in the literature and two sets of data collected by the authors.",在众多关于监管的实证研究中，一个主要挑战是衡量对法律的遵守程度。然而，衡量个人或组织对法律的遵守情况总是困难的。在解释和依赖合规性衡量标准时，存在两大不确定性：首先，收集有关个人或组织违法程度的准确信息存在问题。之所以存在这一问题，是因为相关信息尚未或无法被收集。其次，鉴于“实际合规性”可能无法直接衡量（由于第一类问题），关键在于确定“实际合规性”与我们假设与实际合规性相关、并可能用作实际合规性替代指标的其他衡量标准之间是否存在联系（若有）。本文通过参考文献中对合规性的不同概念化方式以及作者收集的两组数据，批判性分析了衡量合规性不同方法的优缺点。,"regulation, compliance, enforcement, regulatory compliance, social science methodology",2006-10-09

Previous literature has primarily examined the impact of tax cuts on compliance with individual taxes, with limited attention given to compliance behaviors across multiple taxes within the same context. This paper aims to address this gap by constructing a simple theoretical model to analyze how a reduction in the corporate income tax rate influences firms’ compliance behavior regarding both the corporate income tax and the social security payroll tax. By utilizing a unique dataset of Chinese firms from 2005 to 2012 and employing a quasi-experimental design based on a distinctive feature of the 2008 corporate income tax reform in China, our empirical results indicate that a decrease in the corporate income tax rate leads to an increase in firms’ compliance with the corporate income tax while simultaneously promoting social security payroll tax evasion. These results provide evidence of compliance shifting between the corporate income tax and social security payroll tax in response to tax cuts.","纳税人对减税的遵从行为一直是政策制定和学术研究长期关注的焦点。现有文献主要考察了减税对单一税种遵从度的影响，而对同一情境下多税种间遵从行为的关联研究较为有限。本文通过构建理论模型，分析企业所得税率下调如何同时影响企业对所得税和社保费的遵从行为。基于2005-2012年中国企业独特数据集，并利用2008年企业所得税改革中""外资企业税率上调而内资企业税率下调""这一准自然实验特征，实证研究发现：企业所得税率降低会提升企业所得税遵从度，但同时会诱发企业逃避缴纳社保费。这些结果为减税背景下企业所得税与社保费之间存在的遵从转移现象提供了证据。","Tax Cuts, Compliance Shifting, CIT Compliance, Social Security Compliance",2025-03-06
compliance,The Cybersecurity Threat:Complianceand the Role of Whistleblowers,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2803995,Jennifer M. Pacella,"In today’s technologically dependent world, concerns about cybersecurity, data breaches, and compromised personal information infiltrate the news almost daily. The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) has recently emerged as a regulator that is keenly focused on cybersecurity, specifically with respect to encouraging disclosures in this arena from regulated entities. Although the SEC has issued non-binding “guidance” to help companies navigate their reporting obligations in this sector, the agency lacks binding cybersecurity disclosure regulations as they pertain generally to public companies. Given that the SEC has already relied on such guidance in threatening enforcement actions, reporting companies are increasingly pressured for compliance in this arena. This Article will address the importance of establishing effective internal reporting channels and other internal compliance mechanisms in meeting the SEC’s expectations and will highlight the role of “cybersecurity whistleblowers,” specifically those reporting internally, in building the type of improved corporate culture necessary to discover and remediate cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity whistleblowers, like all whistleblowers, commonly experience retaliation for their efforts. Despite the SEC’s commitment to providing whistleblowers retaliation protections through statutes like the Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd-Frank Acts, the absence of binding cybersecurity regulations translates into a direct problem for cybersecurity whistleblowers because their reports are likely to fall outside the scope of “protected activity” enumerated under these statutes. This Article will discuss this gap in protections in light of the SEC’s heightened cybersecurity focus, the feasibility of SEC adoption of binding cybersecurity disclosure regulations, and the broad contributions of whistleblowers to compliance systems generally.","在当今这个高度依赖技术的世界里，网络安全问题、数据泄露事件和个人信息遭窃的新闻几乎每日见诸报端。美国证券交易委员会（SEC）近期作为监管机构，对网络安全领域展现出强烈关注，尤其注重推动受监管实体进行相关信息披露。尽管SEC已发布非强制性的""指导文件""以协助企业履行该领域的报告义务，但针对上市公司的强制性网络安全披露法规仍属空白。鉴于SEC已依据此类指导文件威胁采取执法行动，上市公司正承受着日益增长的合规压力。本文将探讨建立有效的内部报告渠道及其他合规机制对于满足SEC预期的重要性，并着重分析""网络安全举报人""（特别是内部举报者）在构建能够及时发现和修复网络安全风险的企业文化中所起的关键作用。与其他举报人类似，网络安全举报人常因举报行为遭受报复。虽然SEC承诺通过《萨班斯-奥克斯利法案》和《多德-弗兰克法案》为举报人提供反报复保护，但由于缺乏强制性网络安全法规，网络安全举报人面临直接困境——其举报内容很可能不被纳入上述法律规定的""受保护行为""范畴。本文将结合SEC对网络安全的高度关注，探讨现行保护机制的缺陷、SEC出台强制性网络安全披露法规的可行性，以及举报人对合规体系建设的广泛贡献。","cybersecurity, technology, data, compliance, whistleblowing, SEC",2016-07-05

Therefore, understanding the differences in individuals’ tax compliance attitudes remains paramount. Utilizing three online surveys, we develop a taxpayer typology based on a factor and a cluster analysis. Our findings underscore that taxpayers can be classified into two categories: (a) moralists and (b) rationalists. Notably, rationalists consistently exhibit lower tax compliance levels than theirmoralistcounterparts. We introduce a questionnaire labeled the Tax Compliance Attitude Inventory (TCAI) alongside a classification algorithm. These tools enable users to categorize individuals in any dataset applying the TCAI as moralists and rationalists. The heterogeneity in taxpayer attitudes can primarily be attributed to disparities in four key factors: (i) morale, (ii) monetary benefit, (iii) deterrence, and (iv) authority. Lastly, to demonstrate the practical application of our findings, we present an online experiment that tests our results against an incentivized and out-of-sample backdrop.

compliance,The Case for On Chain Privacy andCompliance,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4492919,Shlomit Azgad-Tromer,"Recent trends in financial-regulation compliance of blockchain-based assets (“crypto”), including by the European Union and the U.S. Treasury, reflect regulators’ belief that policy frameworks and regulatory regimes designed for financial intermediaries can be effectively implemented to police the decentralized, software-mediated cryptocurrency markets. Furthermore, a principal tool relied upon to manage the risk of illicit financial transactions in these markets is blockchain analytics, which depend on blockchains’ transaction ledgers being transparent.This paper argues that while these two core premises—intermediary regulation and blockchain transparency—play an essential role in mitigating illicit financial risk in the current environment, exclusive reliance on them raises critical questions that must be addressed as cryptocurrency markets enter mainstream adoption.In traditional financial services, the tension between privacy and compliance is addressed by trusted intermediaries, who maintain private information silos that (when operating as intended) protect customers’ privacy by default. In addition, financial privacy rights enjoy statutory and regulatory protections within these financial intermediaries, giving rise to operational controls restricting access to personal financial information (albeit imperfectly, as reflected in persistent cybersecurity incidents). In light of this default-privacy, compelled disclosures to regulatory agencies and law enforcement support efforts to combat sanctions evasion, terrorist financing, money laundering, and other illicit financial activity.However, in decentralized finance, such trusted intermediaries do not always exist. The vision of decentralized finance is based on peer-to-peer mechanisms that allows users to transact without the involvement of banks or other financial institutions. Intermediary regulation thus does not address the need to regulate blockchain-based finance: it leans on assumptions rooted in the traditional financial world.Moreover, in contrast to this default privacy and compelled transparency of traditional financial services, cryptocurrency markets operating on most public blockchains are transparent by default. Historically, this transparency stems from a technical consideration: it allows the blockchain consensus rules (e.g., preservation of monetary invariants) to be easily verified. Subsequently, this public transaction data has been utilized for additional purposes, including detection of illicit activity via blockchain analytics. However, this default-transparency raises heightened risks to consumers. Transparency and immutability allows anyone with an internet connection to see the full transaction history and net holdings of any wallet holder. Absent the type of privacy protections—both practical and legal—that exist in the traditional financial system, it is not surprising that even legitimate users would employ privacy-preserving technologies like mixers to obfuscate their identity and hide their transaction history from prying eyes, without any intent or desire to engage in illegal activity. Indeed, just as law-abiding citizens and corporations strive to protect their privacy in other contexts, the use of privacy-preserving tools in cryptocurrency context may be considered a cybersecurity best practice. Moreover, imposing the same customer identification requirements (designed to overcome the default-privacy of traditional financial services) in cryptocurrency context raises heightened risks in this environment, because of its diversified nature and the ability to correlate this data with on-chain data.Financial confidentiality and protection of personal information is necessary for widespread adoption of blockchain-based payments for personal and commercial uses. Thus, the reliance on blockchain analytics as a tool for compliance reflects a fundamental tension at the heart of cryptocurrency markets as they currently function: between the needs of consumer privacy and cybersecurity, on the one hand, and the public interest in preventing illicit financial activity, on the other.The key question raised by this dynamic is whether it is possible to create privacy-enhancing technologies that protect legitimate customer privacy while simultaneously providing regulators and law enforcement a way of combating illicit financial risks. We believe that the answer is yes. The paper argues that advances in cryptography and blockchain technology have the potential to overcome the false binary choice between privacy and compliance, through blockchain-native solutions that permit on-chain compliance that is programmable and tailored to jurisdictional needs and enforced by consensus rules. We discuss the contours of this blockchain-native, on-chain compliance and its potential to strike a healthy balance between privacy and compliance in the crypto ecosystem.","欧盟和美国财政部近期对基于区块链的资产（即“加密货币”）金融监管合规的趋势表明，监管机构认为：为金融中介设计的政策框架和监管体系可有效适用于去中心化的软件驱动型加密货币市场。而管控这些市场非法金融风险的核心工具——区块链分析技术，其有效性完全依赖于区块链交易账本的透明性。本文指出，尽管中介机构监管与区块链透明性这两大核心前提在当前环境下对降低非法金融风险至关重要，但随着加密货币进入主流应用，单纯依赖这两点将引发必须正视的关键问题。. . 传统金融服务通过可信中介机构调和隐私与合规的矛盾——这些机构建立的私有信息库在正常运作时默认保护客户隐私。此外，金融隐私权在这些中介机构内享有法律与监管保护，形成限制个人财务信息访问的操作规范（尽管网络安全事件频发显示其并不完善）。基于这种默认隐私性，监管机构与执法部门通过强制披露机制来打击逃避制裁、恐怖融资、洗钱等非法金融活动。. . 但去中心化金融往往不存在此类可信中介。其愿景建立在点对点机制之上，使用户无需银行等金融机构即可交易。因此中介监管模式无法满足链上金融的监管需求，这本质上是传统金融思维的路径依赖。. . 更关键的是，与传统金融""默认隐私+强制透明""的特性相反，多数公链上的加密货币市场具有天然透明性。这种透明性最初源于技术考量：便于验证区块链共识规则（如货币恒定性）。随后公开交易数据被赋予新用途，包括通过区块链分析识别非法活动。但这种默认透明性给用户带来了更高风险——任何联网者都能查看钱包持有者的完整交易记录与净资产。缺乏传统金融体系那种实操与法律双重维度的隐私保护，即便合法用户也会采用混币器等隐私技术来隐藏身份与交易历史，这与其是否从事非法活动无关。事实上，正如守法公民与企业注重日常隐私保护，在加密货币领域使用隐私工具可被视为网络安全最佳实践。此外，直接套用传统金融为突破默认隐私设计的客户识别要求，在链上环境反而会放大风险，因其多元化特性使得这些数据极易与链上数据产生关联。. . 要实现区块链支付在个人与商业场景的普及，财务保密与个人信息保护不可或缺。因此依赖区块链分析作为合规工具，暴露出当前加密货币市场的根本矛盾：消费者隐私与网络安全需求，同打击非法金融活动的公共利益之间的张力。. . 这引发了一个关键问题：能否开发既保护合法用户隐私，又为监管机构提供打击非法金融风险手段的隐私增强技术？本文给出肯定答案。密码学与区块链技术的进步有望打破""隐私OR合规""的伪命题，通过原生链上合规方案实现可编程、适配司法需求且由共识规则强制执行的新型平衡。我们将探讨这种原生链上合规的框架设计，及其在加密生态中建立隐私与合规健康平衡的潜力。","blockchain, crypto, onchain, cryptocurrency, privacy, compliance, aml, anti money laundering, baking, regulation, innovation, sanctions, decentralization",2023-07-08

Although compliance officers may not know exactly when or how compliance failures will occur, they act under the assumption that wrongdoing will be independently sprinkled throughout the company.  This assumption underlies many of the common tools of compliance.  But compliance failures do not necessarily conform to this baseline assumption.  Instead, unethical and illegal acts in business often follow a skewed distribution that makes extreme outcomes more likely.  This volatility, exhibited both in the frequency of compliance lapses and the intensity of their harm, is a function of how individual decision making interacts with the complex networks within corporations.  By failing to recognize this phenomenon, the compliance community has mistargeted its efforts, failing to pay enough attention to the “power few”—those influential individuals within companies that may foster outsized, interconnected compliance risk.

It argues that public trust in policing is needed partly because this may result in public cooperation with justice, but more importantly because public trust in justice builds institutional legitimacy and thus public compliance with the law, and commitment to, the rule of law.

compliance,'CadillacCompliance' Breakdown,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2951115,Todd Haugh,"This Essay argues that the best corporate compliance programs, what are known as “Cadillac compliance” programs, are becoming increasingly criminalized. In at attempt to avoid application of the criminal law, companies have adopted compliance protocols that are motivated by and mimic that law, using the precepts of criminal legislation, enforcement, and adjudication to advance their compliance goals. This approach to compliance is inherently flawed, however—it can never be fully effective in abating corporate wrongdoing. Criminalized compliance regimes are inherently ineffective because they impose unintended behavioral consequences on corporate employees by fostering rationalizations that allow offenders to square their self-perception as “good people” with the unethical or illegal behavior they are contemplating, thereby allowing wrongdoing to go forward. By importing into the corporation many of the criminal law’s delegitimizing features, criminalized compliance regimes create space for rationalizations, facilitating the necessary precursors to the commission of white collar and corporate crime. This insight, which offers a new way of conceptualizing corporate compliance, explains the ineffectiveness of many compliance programs and also suggests how companies might go about fixing them. The Essay addresses, through real-world examples, how companies might use behavioral compliance strategies to combat rationalizations and help repair their “Cadillac compliance” programs.","本文认为，最完善的企业合规计划（即所谓""凯迪拉克式合规""）正日益被刑事化。为避免刑法制裁，企业采用的合规方案往往以刑法为蓝本，通过借鉴刑事立法、执法和司法原则来推进合规目标。然而这种合规模式存在根本缺陷——它永远无法有效遏制企业违法行为。刑事化合规制度之所以失效，在于其会引发非预期的员工行为反应：通过为不当行为提供合理化借口，使违规者能够维持""好人""的自我认知，从而纵容不道德或非法行为的发生。当企业照搬刑法中诸多去正当化的特征时，刑事化合规制度就为行为合理化创造了空间，为白领犯罪和企业犯罪提供了必要温床。这一洞见为理解企业合规提供了新视角，既解释了众多合规计划失效的原因，也为企业改进方案指明了方向。本文通过现实案例，阐述企业如何运用行为合规策略来消除合理化借口，修复其""凯迪拉克式合规""计划。","corporate compliance, corporate crime, white collar crime, behavioral compliance, behavioral ethics, business ethics, rationalizations, legitamacy",2017-04-11

compliance,BeyondCompliance: Helping Nations Cooperate,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1633912,Richard Bilder,"This article – a chapter in a collective volume on compliance and the role of non-binding norms in the international legal system – raises questions regarding the usefulness of the concepts of compliance and “soft law”,  each of which underlies a number of the contributions appearing elsewhere in the collective volume.  In particular, the author suggests that:  (1) approaching issues of the international normative order from the perspective of “compliance” risks obscuring or distorting an understanding of how international norms actually help to structure international order and cooperation; (2) the idea of “compliance with international soft law” may blur and impair the very useful distinction that states traditionally have drawn between legally binding and non-legally binding normative techniques in constructing their normative arrangements; (3) in studies of the international normative order, our primary emphasis and objective should be helping nations cooperate rather than simply “making them behave.” Drawing upon his experience as an attorney in the Office of the Legal Adviser of the U.S. Department of State, the author proposes, in some detail, a possible alternative model of how foreign office and other officials involved in foreign policy decisions take account of arguably relevant international norms and think about issues of compliance.  This alternative model suggests, inter alia, that such officials’ attitudes and behavior regarding situations raising international normative issues may often be conditioned by considerations such as:  (1) their recognition of the legitimacy of tentative and incomplete obligations; (2) their perception that different obligations may reflect varying “densities” of commitment; (3) their efforts to balance their desire to retain their own flexibility and freedom of maneuver with their desire for certainty and predictability on the part of other states or international actors; (4) their awareness of the parties’ tacit acceptance that there may be ranges of permissible flexibility around the “core” obligations of a norm; and (5) their recognition of the legitimate expectation – varying impact of events and pressures arising subsequent to the emergence of a norm.  This alternative model also suggests that the whole bias of the international normative system, and particularly of that involving non-binding norms, is in practice more towards accommodation than “legalistic” contention. Finally, the author: (1) joins others in questioning the coherence of the concept of  “soft international law”, at least as applied to legally non-binding norms and instruments; (2) expresses his concern that an emphasis on compliance may point towards a backward-looking and overly-legalistic focus on state “misbehavior”, rather than a more productive enquiry into devising and deploying better techniques and arrangements to facilitate international cooperation; and (3) suggests types of studies, going beyond a study of compliance alone, to explore more deeply the relation between international norms and state behavior.","本文作为探讨国际法律体系中合规性与非约束性规范作用的合著章节，对""合规性""与""软法""这两个贯穿全书其他论文的核心概念提出了质疑。作者特别指出：(1)从""合规性""视角审视国际规范秩序问题，可能模糊或扭曲对国际规范如何实际构建国际秩序与合作的理解；(2)""国际软法合规""概念可能弱化国家在构建规范安排时对法律约束性与非约束性技术手段的传统重要区分；(3)研究国际规范秩序时，核心重点与目标应是促进国家间合作而非单纯""约束行为""。作者基于其在美国国务院法律顾问办公室的执业经验，详细提出了外交决策者考量国际规范与合规问题的新分析框架。该模型揭示，官员处理涉及国际规范议题时的态度与行为往往受制于：(1)对临时性、不完整义务合法性的认知；(2)对不同义务反映差异化的承诺""密度""的判断；(3)在保持自身行动灵活性与要求他国行为可预测性之间的权衡；(4)对规范""核心义务""周边弹性空间的默许认知；(5)对规范形成后新事态冲击力差异的评估。该模型同时表明，国际规范体系（尤指非约束性规范）在实践中更倾向于协调而非""法条主义""对抗。作者最后：(1)质疑""国际软法""概念（至少针对无法律约束力的规范与文书）的内在一致性；(2)担忧过度强调合规性可能导致对国家""不当行为""的事后追责倾向，而非着力设计更有效的国际合作机制；(3)建议开展超越单纯合规性研究的探索，更深入揭示国际规范与国家行为的互动关系。","Compliance, International Legal System, International Law, International Norms, ""Soft International Law"", Non-Binding International Law, International Cooperation, Compliance With International Law, International Behavior, Foreign Office Decision-Making",2010-07-02

Moreover, these programs are positively associated with tax compliance even if tax procedures, such as tax filing and payment or tax audits, are highly complex.

compliance,Chipping Away atCompliance: HowCompliancePrograms Lose Legitimacy and Its Impact on Unethical Behavior,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3551756,David Hess,"Employee perceptions of an organization’s compliance program are critical. A program that has lost legitimacy with its employees is not just ineffective, but creates more harm than good by leading to more unethical behavior. This paper first presents two different, but often working in tandem, ways that corporate actors can inadvertently diminish the legitimacy of the compliance program. The next part discusses how an illegitimate compliance program can lead to an increase in unethical and illegal behavior. The final part suggests reforms to help protect against this process of a compliance program slowly losing its legitimacy within the organization. These reforms are a board level standing committee on compliance, an independent CECO, and a mandatory evaluation of the corporation’s ethical culture, as necessary reforms.",员工对企业合规计划的看法至关重要。一个在员工眼中失去合法性的合规计划不仅无效，还会因引发更多不道德行为而弊大于利。本文首先阐述了企业行为者可能无意中削弱合规计划合法性的两种不同（但往往协同作用的）方式。接着讨论了不合法的合规计划如何导致不道德和非法行为的增加。最后提出了防止合规计划在组织内逐渐丧失合法性这一过程的改革建议：设立董事会层面的合规常设委员会、设立独立的首席道德与合规官（CECO），以及对企业的道德文化进行强制性评估，这些都是必要的改革措施。,"Compliance and Ethics Programs, Corporate Culture, Sentencing Guidelines, Compliance Officers",2020-04-03

Therefore, this study investigates cyber risk management in supply chain contexts.Methodology: Adapting a systematic literature review process, papers from interdisciplinary areas published between 1990 and 2017 were selected. Different typologies, developed for conducting descriptive and thematic analysis were established using data mining techniques to conduct a comprehensive, replicable and transparent review.Findings: The review identifies multiple future research directions for cyber security/resilience in supply chains. A conceptual model is developed, which indicates a strong link between IT, organisational and supply chain security systems. The human/behavioural elements within cyber security risk are found to be critical; however, behavioural risks have attracted less attention due to a perceived bias towards technical (data, application and network) risks. There is a need for raising risk awareness, standardised policies, collaborative strategies and empirical models for creating supply chain cyber-resilience.Research implications: Different type of cyber risks and their points of penetration, propagation levels, consequences and mitigation measures are identified. The conceptual model developed in this study drives an agenda for future research on supply chain cyber security/resilience.Practical implications: A multi-perspective, systematic study provides a holistic guide for practitioners in understanding cyber-physical systems. The cyber risk challenges and the mitigation strategies identified support supply chain managers in making informed decisions.Originality: This is the first systematic literature review on managing cyber risks in supply chains.

Conventionally, a pull supply chain generates a higher optimal order quantity and hence higher supply chain profit than a push supply chain when firms are risk neutral. Extended from the classic push and pull newsvendor models, this paper investigates the impact of firms’ risk averse attitudes on supply chain performance. Based on firms’ Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), our analysis indicates that the conventional wisdom no longer holds, in that push can lead to a higher optimal order quantity than pull when the supplier is sufficiently more risk averse than the retailer. Meanwhile, pull contracts cannot always survive push challenge like in risk-neutral supply chains. We demonstrate that three-part tariff revenue sharing or buy-back contracts can coordinate both the push and the pull supply chains to achieve the Pareto optimality maximizing combined supply chain CVaR; however, because risk attitude distorts the supply chain optimal ordering, risk correction is needed as long as the supply chain risk attitude is not neutral.",文献表明，供应链绩效受库存风险分配的影响。传统观点认为，当企业风险中性时，拉动式供应链比推动式供应链能产生更高的最优订单量，从而实现更高的供应链利润。本文基于经典的推动与拉动式报童模型，探讨了企业风险规避态度对供应链绩效的影响。通过企业条件风险价值（CVaR）分析发现，传统结论在供应商风险规避程度显著高于零售商时发生逆转——推动式可能产生比拉动式更高的最优订单量。同时，与风险中性供应链不同，拉动式契约并非总能抵御推动式挑战。研究表明，三部收费制收益共享或回购契约能协调推动与拉动式供应链，实现帕累托最优的最大化联合供应链CVaR；但由于风险态度会扭曲供应链最优订购决策，只要供应链存在风险偏好，就需要进行风险修正。,Push and Pull Supply Chains; Risk Averse Attitude; Supply Chain Coordination; Newsvendor,2016-10-17

Prediction of potential failure points and overall impact of these risks is challenging. In this paper, systems thinking concepts are applied for modelling supply chain risks. The aim of this research is to develop a holistic, systematic and quantitative risk assessment process for measuring the overall risk behaviour. Design/Methodology/Approach - A framework for Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) is developed and tested using an industrial case study. A systematically developed research design is employed to capture the dynamic behaviour of risks. Additionally, a system based supply chain risk model is conceptualized for risk modelling. Sensitivity modelling results are combined for validating the supply chain risk model.

Within this context, drawing from the knowledge-based view of the firm, we investigate the influence of internal and external knowledge transfer activities on supply chain flexibility. In addition, taking a contingency perspective, we hypothesize about the moderating effects of product and supply complexity on the relationships between knowledge transfer and supply chain flexibility. We test our hypotheses with data collected from procurement and supply chain professionals in Germany. Pursuant to our expectations, we find a positive and significant influence of internal and external knowledge transfer on supply chain flexibility. We further confirm a negative moderating effect of supply complexity on the relationship between internal knowledge transfer and supply chain flexibility, and a negative moderating effect of product complexity on the relationship between external knowledge transfer and supply chain flexibility. However, contrary to our expectations, we also find significant positive effects for the remaining two moderations, being indicative of the unique dynamics emanating from complexity, able to yield both positive and negative moderation effects contingent on the situation. Overall, these findings provide important insight into the value of knowledge transfer activities for supply chain flexibility, and especially into when knowledge transfer is most effective, drawing attention to influential complexity contingencies.

A cognitive map first captured the inter-relationships based on a mental model established by a group of experts. Later, a survey gathered from industry practitioners assessing causal relationships identified key climate change factors and most influenced supply chain performance dimensions. Finally, a system dynamics model supported by multiple case scenarios assessed the implications of climate change on supply chain performance.

Villena,"Applying the behavioral agency model developed by Wiseman and Gomez-Mejia (1998), this paper analyzes human resource factors that induce supply chain executives (SCEs) to make decisions that foster or hinder supply chain integration. We examine two internal sources - compensation and employment risk - and one external source - environmental volatility - of risk bearing that can make SCEs more reluctant to make the decision of promoting supply chain integration. We argue and empirically confirm the notion that an employment and compensation system that increases SCE risk bearing reduces the SCE´s willingness to make risky decisions and thus discourages supply chain integration. We also reveal that this negative relationship becomes stronger under conditions of high environmental volatility. In addressing the “so what?” question, we find empirical support for the hypothesis that supply chain integration positively influences operational performance. Even though this decision has positive value for the firm, we found that SCEs discourage supply chain integration when they face higher risk bearing. Hypotheses are tested using a combination of primary survey data and archival measures in a sample of 133 Spanish firms.","本文运用Wiseman与Gomez-Mejia（1998）提出的行为代理模型，分析了促使供应链高管（SCEs）做出促进或阻碍供应链整合决策的人力资源因素。我们考察了两种内部风险承担来源——薪酬与雇佣风险，以及一种外部来源——环境波动性，这些因素会增强SCEs对推动供应链整合决策的抵触情绪。我们论证并实证检验了以下观点：增加SCEs风险承担的雇佣与薪酬体系会降低其风险决策意愿，从而抑制供应链整合。研究还揭示，在高环境波动性条件下，这种负向关系更为显著。针对""研究意义""问题，我们实证支持了""供应链整合对运营绩效产生正向影响""的假设。尽管该决策对企业具有积极价值，但发现当SCEs面临较高风险承担时，会阻碍供应链整合。研究通过结合原始调查数据与档案测量方法，对133家西班牙企业样本进行了假设检验。","Behavioral agency model, decision making, executive risk taking, risk bearing, supply chain executive, supply chain integration, performance, multidisciplinary research",2013-03-02

The study develops a supply chain risk sharing contract to mitigate demand uncertainty and price volatility related risks in a globalised business environment. An integer programming model is developed and analysed following an automotive case study to generate insights into buyer-supplier relationships. Multiple buyer-supplier power and dependence scenarios are considered to reflect the possible leverages involved in the decision-making. The situational strength evaluated through buyer-supplier power and dependence illuminates the inherent complexity in contract negotiation. Thus there is an evident need to develop risk sharing contracts for mitigating global risks. The developed relationship framework and risk sharing contract model are expected to help SC managers in better understanding behavioural aspects during contract negotiations. The risk sharing contract model proposed here also contributes to a potentially novel perspective on existing theory in buyer-supplier power and dependence by providing a relational perspective on the dynamics of supply chain design and collaboration.,本文旨在理解风险分担合同下的买方-供应商权力与依赖关系情景。研究设计了一种供应链风险分担合同，以缓解全球化商业环境中需求不确定性与价格波动相关的风险。通过一个汽车行业案例研究，开发并分析了整数规划模型，以深入理解买方-供应商关系。研究考虑了多种买方-供应商权力与依赖情景，以反映决策中可能涉及的杠杆效应。通过评估买方-供应商权力与依赖所体现的情境强度，揭示了合同谈判中固有的复杂性。因此，制定风险分担合同以应对全球风险的需求显而易见。所建立的关系框架和风险分担合同模型有望帮助供应链管理者更好地理解合同谈判中的行为因素。本文提出的风险分担合同模型还为买方-供应商权力与依赖的现有理论提供了潜在的新视角，通过关系视角阐释了供应链设计与协作的动态性。,Supply chain,2011-05-23

In contrast to ocean tsunamis, they can in principle be prevented through timely and adequate managerial action. However, their immediate impact is just as sudden and disruptive, and their ability to reshape supply chains of companies and even industries equally long-lasting. They are fundamentally different from phenomena like the “bullwhip effect” (Lee et al., 1997) and “black swan events” (Taleb, 2007). This paper further explores a preliminary typology of supply chain tsunamis suggested in an earlier publication (Akkermans and Van Wassenhove, 2013). Each type of tsunami focuses on a very different part of the supply chain periphery where the first signals of a developing tsunami can be observed. In this paper we use a detailed example from the high-tech electronics industry to describe how a supply chain tsunami unfolds over time. This is done both from an external and an internal perspective. The external perspective shows the sequence of events visible to the outside observer. The internal perspective focuses on the managerial decisionmaking processes that cause and (sometimes) resolve supply chain tsunamis. We link the notion of supply chain tsunamis to the broader need to revive strategic operations management research. Supply chain tsunamis affect corporate strategy and have a profound impact on business and management. They are living proof that operations remain, after almost half a century, the “missing link in corporate strategy” (Skinner, 1969). Therefore, we argue that business tsunamis deserve deeper research and suggest some avenues.","本文提出""供应链海啸""作为一种重要的战略性供应链现象。与自然界的海啸类似，供应链海啸发生间隔较长，因此容易被误认为是偶发事件而非周期性现象。但与海洋海啸不同，原则上可以通过及时有效的管理措施加以预防。然而其突发影响同样具有破坏性，且重塑企业乃至行业供应链格局的效力同样持久。这种现象与""牛鞭效应""(Lee等，1997)和""黑天鹅事件""(Taleb，2007)存在本质区别。本文基于早期研究(Akkermans和Van Wassenhove，2013)提出的初步分类框架，深入探讨供应链海啸的类型学特征——每类海啸都聚焦于供应链外围的不同环节，这些区域往往最先显现海啸形成的信号。我们以高科技电子行业为例，从外部观察者视角和内部决策者视角，详细阐述供应链海啸的动态演变过程：前者呈现可观测的事件序列，后者聚焦引发（有时化解）海啸的管理决策机制。通过将供应链海啸概念与战略运营管理研究的复兴需求相联系，我们指出这种现象直接影响企业战略，对商业管理产生深远影响。在运营管理研究发展近半个世纪后，供应链海啸现象再次印证了""运营仍是企业战略缺失的一环""(Skinner，1969)的论断。因此我们认为商业海啸现象值得深入研究，并提出了若干研究方向。","Supply Chain Disruptions, Supply Chain Strategy, Risk Management, Supply Chain Resilience, Organizational Sensemaking",2017-11-17

The paper at hand paper delivers a systematic review of the existing literature, featuring in-depth analysis and cognition on the ever-expanding supply chain risk management (SCRM) topic. The findings reveal that there is a lack of empirical evidence for the relational linkage between SCRM and performance. However, ‘top’ 24 antecedents for effective SCRM and various SCRM risk sources classified into supply-side, demand-side, external, and internal risks have been identified. The results of these useful insights allow for an identification of gaps to foster further investigations that will offer an advanced understanding of SCRM and its effect on performance.

supply chain risk,The Effects of Trust and Capability inSupplyChainon Firm Performance throughSupplyChainAgility and Collaborative Advantage,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3562569,Murat Çemberci,"Purpose - In this research, an integrated model is proposed to explore the effects of trust, agility, collaborative advantage and capability dimensions on firm performance and how they interact with one another.  In some of the research in the literature, the effect of the dimensions that are trust in supply chain, supply chain agility, collaborative advantage in supply chain and supply chain capability on firm performance has been empirically proven. Yet, no research exists in the literature that explains the indirect effects of these dimensions through one another. Consequently, this study aims to close this gap in the extant literature.Design/methodology/approach – Structural equation modelling method was utilised to test the hypotheses of this study. Quantitative data was obtained by means of survey in a five-point Likert scale. Initially, confirmatory faction analyses and reliability analysis were performed respectively to determine the validity and reliability of the scale. The analyses were performed with SPSS and AMOS statistics programs.Findings – As a result of the data analyses and tests of hypotheses conducted in this study, it has been empirically proven that supply chain agility and collaborative advantage in supply chain are indirectly and directly influenced by trust in the supply chain. These results are in accordance with the extant literature.Discussion – Knowing the expectations of the customers is crucial for firms in today's business environment. The reason for this is that firms need to manage external business processes in order not to be affected by uncertainty in customers’ needs. Therefore, the effects of supply chain management on firm performance have begun to be studied more in recent years. In other words, transformation of the agility into the capability or transformation of the trust into the collaborative advantage can help to explain the effects of these dimensions on the firm performance.",目的——本研究提出一个整合模型，探讨信任、敏捷性、协作优势与能力维度对企业绩效的影响及其相互作用机制。现有文献中已有部分研究实证证明了供应链信任、供应链敏捷性、供应链协作优势及供应链能力等维度对企业绩效的直接影响，但尚未有研究能解释这些维度通过彼此产生的间接影响。因此，本研究旨在填补这一文献空白。. . 设计/方法/路径——采用结构方程模型检验研究假设，通过五级李克特量表问卷调查获取定量数据。研究首先分别进行验证性因子分析和信度分析以确定量表的效度与信度，所有分析均通过SPSS和AMOS统计软件完成。. . 研究发现——通过数据分析和假设检验，本研究实证表明：供应链敏捷性和供应链协作优势既直接受供应链信任影响，也存在间接影响路径。这一发现与现有文献结论一致。. . 讨论——在当今商业环境中，洞悉客户需求对企业至关重要。企业需要通过管理外部业务流程来规避客户需求不确定性的影响。正因如此，近年来供应链管理对企业绩效的影响机制日益受到学界关注。具体而言，敏捷性向能力的转化或信任向协作优势的转化，都有助于解释这些维度对企业绩效的作用路径。,"Trust in Supply Chain, Supply Chain Agility, Supply Chain Capability, Collaborative Advantage in Supply Chain",2020-04-22

supply chain risk,Keep Your Friends Close?SupplyChainDesign and DisruptionRisk,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2757754,Marco Habermann,"In this article, we evaluate the relationship between supply chain design decisions and supply chain disruption risk. We explore two supply chain design strategies: (i) the dispersion of supply chain partners to reduce supply chain disruption risk versus (ii) the co-location of supply chain partners to reduce supply chain disruption risk. In addition, we assess supply chain disruption risk from three perspectives: the inbound material flow from the supplier (supply side), the internal production processes (internal), and the outbound material flow to the customer (customer side) as a disruption can occur at any of these locations. We measure disruption risk in terms of stoppages in flows, reductions in flow, close calls (disruptions that were prevented at the last minute), disruption duration (time until normal operation flow was restored), and the spread of disruptions all the way through the supply chain.We use seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) to analyze our data, finding that lead times, especially supply side lead times, are significantly associated with higher levels of supply chain disruption risk. We find colocation with suppliers appears to have beneficial effects to the reduction of disruption duration, and, overall supply side factors have a higher impact when it comes to supply chain disruption risk than comparable customer side factors.",本文评估了供应链设计决策与供应链中断风险之间的关系。我们探讨了两种供应链设计策略：(i)分散供应链合作伙伴以降低中断风险；(ii)集中布局供应链合作伙伴以降低中断风险。同时，我们从三个维度评估中断风险：供应商的物料流入（供应端）、内部生产流程（内部环节）以及流向客户的物料输出（客户端），因为中断可能发生在任一环节。我们通过流量停滞、流量缩减、临界事故（最后一刻被避免的中断）、中断持续时间（恢复正常运营所需时间）以及中断在整个供应链中的蔓延程度来衡量风险。. . 采用似不相关回归(SUR)分析数据发现：交货周期（尤其是供应端交货周期）与更高水平的供应链中断风险显著相关。研究显示，与供应商集中布局有利于缩短中断持续时间，且总体而言，供应端因素对中断风险的影响程度超过同类客户端因素。,"supply chain design, supply chain disruption, survey research, supply chain risk",2016-04-03

Dekker,"As a consequence of the development of intensified relations with suppliers, for many firms the supply chain has become a significant source of risk exposure. In this paper we examine firms’ use of control practices to manage risks associated with intensified collaboration with supply chain partners. Specifically, we examine how buyers manage risks associated with interfirm transactions through their choice of supply partner, in terms of perceived goodwill and competence trust, and their use of multiple interrelated supply chain management (SCM) control practices. These control practices include contractual contingency planning, performance target setting, operational reviews, information sharing, supplier support and joint problem solving. We collect survey data from Japanese manufacturing firms about their relations with part suppliers to test hypotheses about the associations between transaction risks, selection of trusted suppliers and use of SCM practices. Our results support that transaction characteristics that are at the basis of transaction risks significantly affect the selection of trusted partners to collaborate with as well as their use of various control practices to manage relationships.

Scheibe,"When a disruption occurs in a firm, its effects are often felt throughout the supply chain. As supply chains expand globally and companies pursue velocity and efficiency, the probability of disruptions propagating throughout a chain grows. In this paper, we employ a qualitative, grounded theory case study approach to help understand what drives supply chain disruption propagation and to provide theoretical insights into this emerging area. For a more complete perspective, we study three interconnected tiers in seven unique supply chains. Each supply chain triad consists of (1) a focal firm (a manufacturer), (2) a supplier to the focal firm and (3) a customer of the focal firm allowing us to gain perspective from three levels in multiple supply chains. Three aggregate dimensions are defined which help explain the propagation of supply chain disruptions: the nature of the disruption, structure and dependence, and managerial decision-making. Within these dimensions, six themes are identified giving an increased level of granularity into disruption propagation: correlation of risk, compounding effects, cyclical linkages, counterparty risk, herding and misaligned incentives. Organisations should consider these themes and their interactions to effectively deal with supply chain disruptions.",当企业发生中断时，其影响通常会波及整个供应链。随着供应链的全球扩张和企业对速度与效率的追求，中断在整个链条中传播的可能性也随之增加。本文采用定性、扎根理论的案例研究方法，旨在理解驱动供应链中断传播的因素，并为这一新兴领域提供理论洞见。为了获得更全面的视角，我们研究了七个独特供应链中三个相互关联的层级。每个供应链三元组包括：（1）核心企业（制造商），（2）核心企业的供应商，以及（3）核心企业的客户，这使我们能够从多个供应链的三个层级获取视角。我们定义了三个聚合维度来解释供应链中断的传播：中断的性质、结构与依赖性，以及管理决策。在这些维度中，我们识别出六个主题，从而更细致地理解中断传播：风险相关性、复合效应、循环关联、对手风险、羊群效应和激励错位。组织应考虑这些主题及其相互作用，以有效应对供应链中断。,"Supply Chain Risk Management, Disruption Management, Supply Chain Disruption Propagation, Systemic Risk, Case Study",2017-11-14
supply chain risk,Engineering Design Methodology for Green-FieldSupplyChainArchitectures Taxonomic Scheme,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2998428,Petar Radanliev,"Supply chain engineering requires a design that possesses the flexibility of a complex adaptive system, consisting of interlinking architecture, with external dimensions and system germane internal elements. The aim of this paper is to critically analyse the key supply chain concepts and approaches, to assess the fit between the research literature and the practical issues of supply chain architecture, design and engineering. The objective is to develop a methodology for strategy engineering, which could be used by practitioners when integrating supply chain architecture and design. Taxonomic scheme is applied to consider criteria for strategy architecture, hierarchical strategy integration design, strategy engineering, and integration of supply chain as a conceptual system. The results from this paper derived with the findings that the relationship between supply chain architecture, design and engineering is weak, and challenges remain in the process of adapting and aligning operations. This paper derived with a novel approach for addressing these obstacles, through a conceptual framework diagram and a new methodology, based on the taxonomic scheme. The novelty that derives from this paper is an engineering design methodology for integrating supply chain architecture and design, with criteria that enable decomposing and building a green-field (new and non-existent) supply chain as a system. The taxonomic scheme revealed a number of tools and mechanism, which enabled the development of a new methodology for engineering integrated architecture and design. The review derived with improvements to current and existing theories for analysing interdependencies within and between their individual contexts. This issue is addressed with a hierarchical method for network design, applied for building and combining the integration criteria.

supply chain risk,Motorola's Global FinancialSupplyChainStrategy,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2546320,Ian Blackman,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to define and explore the concept of financial supply chain strategy in a global business environment. The paper aims to illustrate the concepts with a detailed case study of Motorola’s global financial supply chain. Design/methodology/approach – This is a detailed, longitudinal case study analysis of a focal organisation and its economic partners in a financial supply chain. The case study combines qualitative analysis of the strategy evolution with extensive time-series data and quantitative analyses of the performance of the financial supply chain. Findings – The financial supply chain is an integral component of Motorola’s overall supply chain management strategy. Physical product, information systems and financial flows are closely aligned with each other throughout the supply chain incorporating Motorola, its customers, suppliers and banks. The overall trend is towards the development of an integrated global financial supply chain in which cash flows mirror product flows. Motorola shares financial data with its suppliers as part of a cooperative strategy that generates cost savings for Motorola and its suppliers in areas such as foreign exchange and cash balances. The cooperative strategy also improves the quality of the payments process measured by six sigma techniques and produces strategic benefits such as risk reduction for the supply chain as a whole in areas such as foreign exchange and payments. A strategy of this type is only possible by taking a global perspective of the financial supply chain. Research limitations/implications – The development of financial supply chains has not been fully addressed in the supply chain management literature. This paper defines this relatively new topic area and explains its significance in its own right, and also in terms of the inter-relationships between finance and manufacturing supply chains. A research agenda for financial supply chains is proposed that describes a range of new research opportunities in this area. Practical implications – The development of integrated financial supply chains will lead to significant savings in terms of funding, banking and administrative costs associated with treasury and payment activities. The implementation and nature of the strategic change also highlight important strategic planning and implementation issues associated with financial supply chains. Originality/value – The strategic importance of financial supply chains for business and academic researchers is demonstrated through the definition of this topic and the application of a research framework to a detailed study of Motorola’s global financial supply chain using time-series data of strategy evolution and financial supply chain performance. The research findings and comparison with theory support the assertion that this is a relatively new and unexplored problem area that is of direct relevance and interest to researchers in supply chain management.",目的——本文旨在定义并探讨全球商业环境中的金融供应链战略概念，通过摩托罗拉全球金融供应链的详细案例研究来阐释相关理论。设计/方法论/途径——本研究采用纵向案例分析法，聚焦核心企业及其金融供应链中的经济合作伙伴，结合战略演变的定性分析与时间序列数据及金融供应链绩效的定量评估。研究发现——金融供应链是摩托罗拉整体供应链管理战略的核心组成部分。实物产品、信息系统与资金流在涵盖摩托罗拉、客户、供应商及银行的整条供应链中保持高度协同，最终趋势是建立产品流与资金流同步的全球化集成金融供应链。摩托罗拉通过共享财务数据与供应商实施合作战略，在外汇管理、现金头寸等领域实现协同降本。该战略还通过六西格玛方法提升支付流程质量，并为整条供应链带来外汇风险管控等战略性收益。此类战略唯有基于金融供应链的全球化视野方能实现。研究局限性/启示——现有供应链管理文献尚未充分探讨金融供应链的发展。本文界定了这一新兴领域，阐释其独立价值及与制造供应链的关联性，并提出包含多维度研究机会的金融供应链学术议程。实践意义——集成化金融供应链的发展将为资金运作、银行业务及财资支付相关的管理成本带来显著节约。战略变革的实施过程亦揭示了金融供应链战略规划与执行的关键议题。原创性/价值——通过理论框架构建与摩托罗拉案例的实证研究（含战略演进时间序列数据及供应链绩效分析），论证了金融供应链对学界与业界的战略重要性。研究发现与理论对比证实，这是供应链管理领域具有直接研究价值且尚未充分探索的新兴课题。,"Financial supply chain, global finance strategy, Six sigma financial process, globalised finance operations, Banking, global payments, Foreign exchange",2015-01-09

Enterprise supply chain integration is needed to ensure an enterprise achieves a certain level of service performance, have a discernible information flow, generates profit, and creates an effective and efficient decision in order to provide maximum value-added benefits to customers and suppliers. The results of previous studies are not consistent, namely the relationship between supply chain integration and the company's internal performance. This research focuses on the antecedent of supply chain integration which consists of Internal Company Integration, Customer Integration and Supplier Integration that are linked to a firm's performances. The study collected responses from 262 employees in a travel agency registered in North Jakarta and analyzed statistically using SPSS. The research used three dimensions of Supply Chain Integration (Internal Integration, Supplier Integration and Customer Integration) and interactions with Company Performance. The results of the study showed that Supply Chain Integration affects Company Performance; whereas Internal Integration and Customer Integration have a higher influence on improving Company Performance rather than Supplier Integration.

supply chain risk,RiskAversion andSupplyChainContract Negotiation,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1334695,Matthew J. Sobel,"We employ the Nash bargaining solution to determine the value of an opportunity to negotiate a contract in an archetypal supply chain game.  This unifies the allocation of payoffs and the selection of the type of contract in a bilateral supply chain; a supplier delivers goods to a news vendor retailer who stocks in anticipation of stochastic seasonal demand. Both firms have concave, ordinal utility functions which allows us to model both risk-neutrality and risk-aversion. We characterize the Nash-optimal contracts, and contrast the cases where both firms are risk-neutral and where at least one of the firms is risk-averse. Risk aversion, it turns out, has a significant impact on the contract terms and one firm's risk aversion may be advantageous to the other. This suggests that each firm should strive to find a supply chain partner based on its own and its prospective partner's sensitivities to risk. For example, risk-neutral firms have an incentive to avoid other risk-neutral firms as their supply chain partners.",我们采用纳什议价解来确定在一个典型供应链博弈中协商合同机会的价值。这种方法将双边供应链中的收益分配与合同类型选择统一起来；供应商向一个面临随机季节性需求的报童零售商供货。两家企业均具有凹的序数效用函数，这使得我们能够同时建模风险中性和风险规避行为。我们刻画了纳什最优合同的特征，并对比了双方均为风险中性以及至少一方具有风险规避的情形。结果表明，风险规避对合同条款具有显著影响，且一方的风险规避可能对另一方有利。这意味着每家企业都应根据自身及潜在合作伙伴对风险的敏感度来选择供应链伙伴。例如，风险中性企业有动机避免与其他风险中性企业结成供应链伙伴关系。,"Supply chain coordination, risk-aversion, supply contracts, bargaining",2009-01-29
supply chain risk,Explaining the Key Elements of Information Systems-BasedSupply-ChainStrategy that are Necessary for Business-to-Business Electronic Marketplace Survival,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1464522,Jeffrey A. Ogden,"Business-to-business electronic marketplaces (EMs) were hyped as the future of efficient supply chains and as essential to the growth of e-commerce, but in spite of this promise, many EMs failed in the first few years after 2000. Although numerous studies have involved EMs, little research has focused on the degree to which an EM’s automated supply-chain strategy contributed to its survival or failure. Accordingly, this study examines 400 EMs through an extensive survey of the strategic supply-chain capabilities in conjunction with McKinsey & Company and CAPS Research. These results are interpreted using existing strategy literature. The following factors were found to be positively related to EM survival: capturing detailed spend data, providing sourcing and process change recommendations, allowing international contracts, offering the ability to track supplier product availability, and having more than 100 employees. In contrast, the following factors led to EM failure: providing warranties, employing low to medium transaction functionality, integrating with a buyer’s accounting system, allowing buyers to “punch through” to supplier Web sites, permitting the online creation of requisition and purchase orders, transacting a daily volume less than $1,000, and having 25–75 employees. These results highlight the need for EMs to create network effects of economies of scale and scope for buyers, focus on core competencies, and create buyer lock-in through high switching costs. Existing EMs should focus their strategy on developing the factors found to lead to EM survival and eliminating the factors leading to failure.",企业对企业的电子市场（EMs）曾被吹捧为高效供应链的未来，对电子商务的增长至关重要。然而，尽管前景看好，许多电子市场在2000年后的最初几年便宣告失败。尽管已有大量研究涉及电子市场，但很少有研究关注电子市场的自动化供应链策略对其生存或失败的影响程度。为此，本研究通过与麦肯锡公司和CAPS Research合作，对400家电子市场进行了广泛调查，重点考察其战略供应链能力。研究结果结合现有战略文献进行解读。以下因素被发现与电子市场的生存呈正相关：获取详细的支出数据、提供采购和流程变更建议、支持国际合同、具备跟踪供应商产品可用性的能力，以及员工数量超过100人。相反，以下因素导致电子市场失败：提供担保、采用中低交易功能、与买方的会计系统集成、允许买方“直通”供应商网站、支持在线创建请购单和采购订单、日交易量低于1000美元，以及员工数量在25至75人之间。这些结果突显了电子市场需要为买方创造规模经济和范围经济的网络效应，专注于核心竞争力，并通过高转换成本锁定买方。现有的电子市场应将其战略重点放在发展有助于生存的因素上，并消除导致失败的因素。,"electronic markets, business-to-business marketplaces, supply-chain strategy, strategy",2009-09-01

In this paper we argue that while this increase in acceptance and activity is welcome and has lead to a greater understanding of sustainability, our present knowledge is not sufficient to create truly sustainable supply chains. We build on this insight to identify five main issues that future research needs to address. We argue that when it comes to the theory of sustainable supply chain management, previous research has focused on the synergistic and familiar while overlooking trade-offs and radical innovation. These theoretical issues are compounded by measures that do not truly capture a supply chain’s impacts and methods that are better at looking backwards than forwards. The paper concludes by proposing a series of recommendations that address these issues to help in the development of truly sustainable supply chains.",过去二十年里，可持续性议题已从供应链管理研究的边缘走向主流，成为重要研究领域。本文认为，尽管这种认可度和研究活动的提升值得欢迎，并增进了对可持续性的理解，但现有知识仍不足以构建真正可持续的供应链。基于此，我们提出未来研究需解决的五个关键问题：当前可持续供应链管理理论过度关注协同效应和熟悉领域，却忽视了权衡取舍和根本性创新；现有测量方法无法真实反映供应链影响，且评估手段更擅长回顾而非前瞻。论文最后提出系列建议以应对这些问题，助力真正可持续供应链的发展。,"sustainability, supply chain management, sustainable supply chain management",2013-09-10
supply chain risk,All You Need is Trust? An Examination of InterorganizationalSupplyChainProjects,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2200188,Andreas Brinkhoff,"This paper examines the antecedents of supply chain project success. We first propose and test a model that describes the role of relationship-level factors (trust and asymmetric dependence) and project-level factors (between-firm communication and within-firm commitment) in determining supply chain project success. We find that project-level factors completely mediate the effect of trust on project success. We conclude that trust, despite being a stronger predictor compared to asymmetric dependence, is necessary but not sufficient for supply chain project success. We then proceed to further explore the role of these factors by introducing a categorical scheme that differentiates supply chain projects based on the decision rights configuration of each project. This categorization enables us to explore how relationship-level and project-level factors can have different impact on performance based on the characteristics of a supply chain project. The findings offer insights into how to effectively manage supply chain projects and inter-firm alliances.",本文研究了供应链项目成功的前因。我们首先提出并检验了一个模型，该模型描述了关系层面因素（信任与不对称依赖）和项目层面因素（企业间沟通与企业内承诺）在决定供应链项目成功中的作用。研究发现，项目层面因素完全中介了信任对项目成功的影响。我们得出结论：尽管信任比不对称依赖具有更强的预测力，但它对供应链项目成功仅是必要而非充分条件。随后，我们通过引入基于项目决策权配置的供应链项目分类方案，进一步探究这些因素的作用。这种分类使我们能够根据供应链项目的特性，探索关系层面和项目层面因素如何对绩效产生差异化影响。研究结果为有效管理供应链项目与企业间联盟提供了实践启示。,"trust, supply chain management, performance, alliance",2013-01-13

In this paper we discuss the realities of SCC, present prerequisites for the collaboration process, indicate where the process starts and where it may terminate. During the discussion we make use of the concepts of Theory of Constraints (TOC) and approach SCC as an ongoing effort dealing with the supply chain constraints. The roles of the entities in this ongoing effort are not always clear. Often SCC is proclaimed to be a joint decision-making process. However, keeping in mind the powerhouses in the chain, we believe that other structures are possible as well. We emphasize the need for: 1) having an adequate supply chain strategy and well-articulated goals, which form the basis for: 2) leading supply chain change, and: 3) governing the continual process of strategy alignment and supply chain change, which is itself a dynamic process.

supply chain risk,Curtailing Bank Loan and Loan Insurance UnderRiskRegulations inSupplyChainFinance,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3760840,Wenli Wang,"Due to many firms' lack of collateral, banks have imposed loan limits as a form of risk-control regulations of bank financing. In response, loan insurance has emerged as a useful instrument to lift loan limits. To study the joint value of bank loans and loan insurance, this article investigates a supply chain composed of one supplier and one capital-constrained buyer who takes out a bank loan and potentially purchases loan insurance. The analysis reveals that both the supplier and the buyer can benefit from the bank financing with loan insurance in an insurance-cooperation region, wherein the supplier is willing to reduce the wholesale price to entice the buyer to purchase insurance. Further still, in the insurance-cooperation region, worse contract terms of the bank loan benefit the supplier, whereas worse policy terms of loan insurance help the buyer. Such benefits can lead to a higher order quantity than the capital-abundant one and partially coordinate the entire supply chain. However, when production cost is low, the supplier and the buyer can encounter a Stackelberg prisoner's dilemma, in which both firms no longer cooperate with each other and both are worse off. Nevertheless, a government subsidy for the insurance premium can not only reduce the Stackelberg prisoner's dilemma but also improve the social welfare, although it is not always optimal for the government to provide that subsidy. The main qualitative results are robust in a variety of extensions.","由于许多企业缺乏抵押物，银行实施了贷款限额作为银行融资的风险控制手段。为此，贷款保险应运而生，成为突破贷款限额的有效工具。为研究银行贷款与贷款保险的协同价值，本文构建了一个由单一供应商与单一资金受限买方组成的供应链模型——买方通过银行贷款融资，并可能购买贷款保险。研究表明：在保险合作区域内，供应商与买方均可通过""银行贷款+保险""模式实现双赢，此时供应商愿意降低批发价以激励买方投保；更值得注意的是，在该区域内，银行贷款条件恶化反而有利于供应商，而保险条款恶化则对买方更有利。这种机制可使订单量超过资金充足时的水平，并实现供应链的部分协调。但当生产成本较低时，双方可能陷入""斯塔克尔伯格囚徒困境""，导致合作破裂与双输局面。政府提供保费补贴不仅能缓解这种困境、提升社会福利，但研究也表明此类补贴并非总是政府最优选择。主要研究结论在多种扩展模型中均保持稳健。",supply chain finance; risk regulation; bank loan; loan insurance; Stackelberg prisoner's dilemma,2021-03-01
supply chain risk,SystematicRiskinSupplyChainNetworks,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1876443,Nikolay Osadchiy,"Industrial production output is generally correlated with the state of the economy. Nonetheless, during the times of economic downturn some industries take the biggest hit, while at the times of economic boom they reap most benefits. To provide insight into this phenomenon we map supply networks of industries and firms and investigate how the supply network structure mediates the effect of economy on industry or firm sales. Previous research has shown that retail sales are correlated with the state of the economy. Since retailers source their products from other industries, the sales of their suppliers can also be correlated with the state of the economy. This correlation represents the source of systematic risk for an industry that propagates through a supply chain network. Specifically, we identify the following mechanisms that can affect the correlation between sales and the state of the economy in a supply chain network: propagation of systematic risk into production decisions, aggregation of orders from multiple customers in a supply chain network, and aggregation of orders over time. We find that the first effect does not amplify the correlation, however, the latter two intensify correlation and result in the amplification of correlation upstream in supply networks. We demonstrate three managerial implications of this phenomenon: implications for the cost of capital, for the risk-adjusted valuation of supply chain improvement projects, and for supplier selection and risk.",工业生产产出通常与经济状况相关。然而，在经济下行时期，某些行业遭受的冲击最大，而在经济繁荣时期，它们获得的收益也最多。为了深入理解这一现象，我们绘制了行业和企业的供应网络图，并研究供应网络结构如何调节经济对行业或企业销售的影响。先前的研究表明，零售销售与经济状况相关。由于零售商从其他行业采购产品，其供应商的销售也可能与经济状况相关。这种相关性代表了通过供应链网络传播的系统性风险来源。具体而言，我们确定了以下可能影响供应链网络中销售与经济状况相关性的机制：系统性风险向生产决策的传导、供应链网络中来自多个客户订单的聚合，以及订单随时间推移的累积。我们发现第一个效应不会放大相关性，而后两者会强化相关性，并导致供应网络上游的相关性放大。我们展示了这一现象的三个管理启示：对资本成本的影响、对供应链改进项目风险调整估值的影响，以及对供应商选择与风险的影响。,"Supply chain network, Risk management, Empirical study",2011-07-01

Investigating the role of supply chain risk management in service sector will enable managers to prevent risks to their business, and thereby soften shocks for the engulfing economy. Originality/value -- This paper recognizes that supply chain risk management requires further study in different sectors to enrich our understanding of key constructs. Additionally, this paper identifies that there are few studies that analyse the relationship between supply chain risk management and different dimensions of performance, including service supply chain operations, customer service, and corporate performance.",目的——本文旨在识别内外部风险因素，并确立供应链风险管理对酒店业绩的支持作用。  . 设计/方法论/途径——对供应链风险管理与服务供应链绩效相关的文献进行识别与分析。本文概述了用于构建供应链风险管理体系的理论与概念，未来研究可通过问卷调查与结构方程模型验证各构念间的关系。  . 研究结果——酒店业必须妥善管理内外部风险，而供应链风险管理能支撑酒店业绩表现。现有研究多集中于制造业领域，针对服务业的研究较为匮乏。  . 实践意义——本研究可为学术界与业界人士提供参考，帮助其通过管理服务供应链的内外部风险来维持组织绩效。探究供应链风险管理在服务业的作用，有助于管理者预防业务风险，从而缓冲对整体经济的冲击。  . 原创性/价值——本文指出需在不同行业深化供应链风险管理研究以拓展关键构念的认知，同时发现现有研究很少分析供应链风险管理与服务供应链运营、客户服务和企业绩效等多维度表现的关系。,"Internal Risk, External Risk, Supply Chain Risk Management, Service Supply Chain Operations, Customer Service, Corporate Performance",2015-01-02
supply chain risk,SupplyChainContracts that Prevent Information Leakage,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2728017,Yiwei Chen,"This paper determines categories of contracts that facilitate vertical information sharing in a supply chain while precluding horizontal information leakage among competing newsvendors. We consider a supply chain in which retailers replenish inventory from a common supplier to satisfy uncertain demand and are engaged in newsvendor competition. Each retailer has imperfect demand information. Yet, one of the retailers (the incumbent) has a more accurate demand forecast than the other (the entrant). Information leakage among such competing retailers precludes vertical information sharing and is often the reason for many retailers to abandon collaborative forecast-sharing initiatives, leading to sub-optimized supply chains. We show that whether a contract can prevent information leakage depends on how the inventory risk (i.e., cost of supply-demand mismatch) is distributed among the supplier and retailers in conjunction with the allocation of financial flows (i.e., sharing of profits). We categorize contracts based on how they allocate inventory risk among rms when compared with a wholesale price contract. This comparison yields four mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive categories of contracts. A downside-protection contract is one that effectively reduces retailers' cost of excess inventory by shifting some of their overage cost to the supplier. Examples of such contracts include buy-back and revenue-sharing contracts. An upside-protection contract is one that effectively increases retailers' cost of inventory shortage by shifting some of the supplier's underage cost to retailers. Examples of such contracts include penalty and rebate contracts. A two-sided protection contract combines the properties of the previous two categories. A no-protection contract is one that fails to shift firms' cost of inventory shortage or excess from one to the other. Examples of such contracts include wholesale-price and two-part tariff contracts. We show that no-protection contracts, which are extensively used in practice, cannot prevent information leakage whereas others may do so. We also show that preventing information leakage could be costly for the supply chain (i.e., low channel efficiency). We conclude by illustrating how our unied framework to study variety of contracts can enable a rm to determine the best performing contract (among many) that precludes information leakage while almost coordinating the channel. For example, we show why buyback contracts perform significantly better than revenue sharing or rebate contracts.",本文确定了在供应链中促进纵向信息共享、同时防止竞争性报童模型零售商之间横向信息泄露的合同类别。我们研究的供应链中，零售商从共同供应商处补货以满足不确定需求，并处于报童竞争状态。每家零售商都拥有不完善的需求信息，但其中一家（在位者）比另一家（进入者）拥有更准确的需求预测。此类竞争零售商间的信息泄露会阻碍纵向信息共享，并常导致许多零售商放弃协作预测共享计划，从而造成供应链次优状态。研究表明，合同能否防止信息泄露取决于库存风险（即供需失衡成本）如何在供应商与零售商之间分配，以及资金流（即利润分配）的安排。我们根据合同相较于批发价合同对库存风险的分配方式，将合同划分为四个互斥且完备的类别：下行保护合同通过将部分过剩成本转移给供应商，有效降低零售商库存积压成本（如回购合同和收益共享合同）；上行保护合同通过将供应商的部分缺货成本转移给零售商，有效增加零售商库存短缺成本（如罚金合同和返利合同）；双向保护合同兼具前两类特性；无保护合同则无法实现企业间库存短缺或过剩成本的转移（如批发价合同和两部定价合同）。研究表明，实践中广泛采用的无保护合同无法防止信息泄露，而其他类别可能实现该功能，但防止信息泄露可能降低供应链渠道效率。最后，我们通过统一分析框架说明企业如何从多种合同中选择最优方案——既能阻止信息泄露又能近乎协调渠道。例如，研究揭示了为何回购合同的表现显著优于收益共享或返利合同。,supply chain management; information leakage; newsvendor competition; contract categorization; buy-back; revenue-sharing; rebates; two-part tariff; wholesale price,2016-02-06

supply chain risk,SupplyChainRiskandRiskMitigation: Which Strategies Tackle Identified Risks Most Efficiently?,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3215155,Michael Westerburg,"Firms face risks in their upstream and downstream supply chains. Although some operational strategies can fully or partially insulate a firm from the adverse effects of possible supply chain disruptions, implementing these strategies is costly. At the same time, firms face intense pressure on margins, forcing them to keep operating costs low. These conflicting goals require further investigation on whether and to what extent different operational strategies can mitigate several types of risk. This paper delineates and tests how operational strategies mitigate the exposure to supply chain risks with minimum negative influence on performance. To measure a firm’s exposure to supply chain risk, we analyzed corporate qualitative risk disclosures in annual reports (form 10-K) using an adapted latent Dirichlet allocation approach from computational linguistics. The results suggest that operational strategies mitigate the negative association between supply-related risk and performance, but not the negative association between demand-related risk and performance.",企业在上下游供应链中面临风险。尽管某些运营策略能够完全或部分隔离企业免受潜在供应链中断的负面影响，但实施这些策略成本高昂。与此同时，企业面临巨大的利润压力，迫使它们保持较低的运营成本。这些相互冲突的目标需要进一步研究不同运营策略是否以及能在多大程度上缓解多种类型的风险。本文阐述并测试了运营策略如何以对绩效最小负面影响的方式降低供应链风险暴露。为衡量企业对供应链风险的暴露程度，我们采用计算语言学中的改进潜在狄利克雷分配方法，分析了企业年报（10-K表格）中的定性风险披露内容。研究结果表明，运营策略能缓解供应相关风险与绩效之间的负相关关系，但对需求相关风险与绩效之间的负相关关系无显著改善作用。,"supply chain risk, 10-K reports, supply chain risk mitigation, operational slack",2018-08-14

supply chain risk,Text-Based Measure ofSupplyChainRiskExposure,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4158073,Di (Andrew) Wu,"Using textual analysis techniques including seeded word embedding and bag-of-words-based content analysis, I develop a firm-level measure of supply chain risk exposure from a novel source of unstructured data---the discussion between managers and equity analysts on supply chain--related topics during firms' quarterly earnings conference calls. I validate the measure by showing that (1) the measure exhibits intuitive variations over time and across firms, successfully capturing both routine and systematic supply chain risk events; and (2) the measure is about risk exposure, as it significantly correlates with realized and options-implied stock return volatility, even after controlling for well-known aggregate risk measures. I then demonstrate that the measure is specifically indicative of the supply chain component of risk exposure. (3) Consistent with theoretical predictions, firms facing higher supply chain risks have higher inventory buffers, particularly in raw materials and intermediate inputs, increased cash holdings in lieu of investments, and significantly lower trade credit received from suppliers. Moreover, (4) during unexpected risk episodes such as the Tohoku earthquake, firms with higher ex-ante risk exposure have worse operating and financial performance. These results indicate that the text-based measure provides a credible quantification of firm-level exposure to supply chain risks, and can thus be reliably utilized as outcome or explanatory variables in empirical supply chain research.",通过运用包括种子词嵌入和基于词袋模型的内容分析在内的文本分析技术，我从一个新颖的非结构化数据源——企业季度收益电话会议中管理层与股票分析师关于供应链主题的讨论——构建了企业层面供应链风险暴露的测度指标。我通过以下发现验证了该指标的有效性：（1）该指标随时间推移和不同企业间呈现符合直觉的变化，能成功捕捉常规性和系统性供应链风险事件；（2）该指标确实反映风险暴露程度，即使在控制已知的总体风险指标后，仍与已实现股票收益波动率和期权隐含波动率显著相关。随后我证明该指标能特异性识别风险暴露中的供应链成分。（3）与理论预测一致，面临较高供应链风险的企业会持有更多库存缓冲（尤其是原材料和中间品）、增加现金持有而非投资、并显著减少从供应商获得的贸易信贷。此外，（4）在东北大地震等突发风险事件中，事前风险暴露较高的企业经营和财务表现更差。这些结果表明基于文本的测度方法能可靠量化企业层面供应链风险暴露，可有效应用于实证供应链研究作为结果变量或解释变量。,"textual analysis, supply chain risk, empirical operations management",2022-07-29

The system examines the decisions made when engineering the business strategy, with regards to the supply chain design. The system derived with a new understanding of how strategies are integrated, and what are the implications for engineering successful strategies. The study revealed that supply chain design is not considered in great detail before architecting the business strategies.

In addition to this increased sensitivity of supply chains, a significant increase in the frequency and number of events leading to major disruptions, and their magnitude are forcing organizations to take supply chain risk more seriously. This paper discusses the concept of supply chain risk, supply chain risk management, its dimensions and the role of information technologies in general and enterprise systems in particular. It will discuss the challenges faced by business organizations in leveraging the existing and future information technologies and systems and their double-edged role. While industry reference models have the potential to internalise the supply chain risk management processes, their ability in identification and mitigation of the supply chain risk is limited and depends upon other IT-dependent factors such as information visibility, trust, security of intellectual property information, ability to collect snapshots of demand, inventory and capacity at key nodes in the supply chain, and the sense and respond capability of the organization to deal with material flow disruptions.",制造业和产品开发活动的离岸外包增加、合同制造、全球采购、减少库存的精益运营、集中化分销与仓储、供应商基础缩减以及供应链紧密整合，虽然使供应链效率更高、响应更快，但也使其比以往更容易受到干扰而变得脆弱。除了供应链敏感度上升外，导致重大中断的事件频率和数量显著增加，其影响程度也迫使企业更严肃地对待供应链风险。本文探讨了供应链风险的概念、供应链风险管理及其维度，以及信息技术尤其是企业系统在其中扮演的角色。文章将讨论企业在利用现有及未来信息技术和系统时面临的挑战，以及这些技术的双刃剑作用。虽然行业参考模型有望将供应链风险管理流程内化，但其识别和缓解供应链风险的能力有限，并依赖于其他与信息技术相关的因素，如信息可见性、信任、知识产权信息安全、在供应链关键节点收集需求/库存/产能快照的能力，以及组织应对物料流中断的感知与响应能力。,"Supply chain risk, Information technologies, Enterprise systems, SCOR",2012-10-06

Drawing on interviews with seven major UK-based companies in the construction, property, utilities and rail sectors, we review companies’ approaches to ‘REEL’ supply chain risks: reputational, ethical, environmental and legal. These risks arise where the actions of a supplier may damage its customer – even if the customer is separated from the supplier by several links in the chain. Examples of this kind of risk include the reputational damage inflicted on a firm when one of its suppliers is found to be illegally or unduly damaging the environment, or hiring illegal labour, or engaging in some other breach of acceptable business practice. Fairly or unfairly, large companies may be held to account as if they were the culpable party, and are seen as sharing at least some of the responsibility for the supplier’s behaviour. What firms should actually do in the face of these challenges remains unclear. By exploring these issues we suggest a series of insights that may help organizations navigate this complex terrain.","在这份简短报告中，我们探讨了供应链风险的一些关键方面。基于对英国建筑、房地产、公用事业和铁路领域七家主要企业的访谈，我们审视了企业对""REEL""供应链风险（声誉、道德、环境及法律风险）的应对策略。这类风险产生于供应商行为可能损害其客户的情况——即使客户与供应商之间隔着多个供应链环节。此类风险的典型案例包括：当企业供应商被发现非法或过度破坏环境、雇用非法劳工或存在其他违反商业道德行为时，该企业遭受的声誉损害。无论公平与否，大型企业可能像责任方一样被追责，并被视作至少需部分承担供应商行为的责任。面对这些挑战，企业究竟该如何应对仍不明确。通过探讨这些问题，我们提出了一系列见解，或可帮助组织应对这一复杂局面。","Supply chain risk, managing supply chain risk, supplier management, corporate responsibility",2015-10-26
supply chain risk,Managing Information Processing Needs in GlobalSupplyChains: A Prerequisite to SustainableSupplyChainManagement,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2838110,Christian Busse,"Sustainability is an important topic in supply chain management research and practice. For buying firms, one of the most pressing challenges associated with sustainable supply chain management is that they frequently do not possess sufficient information on what is occurring in their complex supply chains, as demonstrated by numerous incidents lacking sustainability. Using eight in-depth case studies across four industries and elaborating on information processing theory, we identify three forms of sustainability-related uncertainty that each firm is facing in its supply chain. We refer to them as task uncertainty, source uncertainty, and supply chain uncertainty. The study shows that the extent to which these uncertainties translate into information processing needs depends on a newly identified boundary condition labelled uncertainty intolerance. With respect to the management of such information processing needs, prior research has pointed primarily at matching information processing needs with fitting information processing capacity and secondly at mitigating information processing needs with corrective measures. This study illuminates how some innovative firms occasionally employ a more radical sustainability-driven supply chain modification mechanism. In doing so, this research exemplifies how sustainable supply chain management may eventually turn from an amendment to a firm’s daily business to a decisive factor for shaping future supply chains. In addition, the study constitutes a nascent step to elevate information processing theory to the supply chain level.",可持续性是供应链管理研究和实践中的一个重要议题。对于采购企业而言，可持续供应链管理面临的最紧迫挑战之一，是它们往往无法充分掌握复杂供应链中的实际情况，这一点已通过众多缺乏可持续性的事件得到印证。我们通过对四个行业的八个深度案例研究，并基于信息处理理论，识别出每个企业在供应链中面临的三种可持续性相关不确定性：任务不确定性、来源不确定性和供应链不确定性。研究表明，这些不确定性转化为信息处理需求的程度，取决于一个新发现的边界条件——不确定性容忍度。关于此类信息需求的管理，先前研究主要提出两点：一是通过匹配信息处理能力来满足需求，二是采取纠正措施降低信息需求。本研究揭示了一些创新企业如何运用更激进的可持续性驱动型供应链改造机制。由此，这项研究展现了可持续供应链管理可能从企业日常业务的补充要素，最终转变为塑造未来供应链的决定性因素。此外，本研究为将信息处理理论提升至供应链层面迈出了探索性的一步。,"sustainable supply chain management, information processing theory, uncertainty, true sustainability, radical innovation",2016-09-14

supply chain risk,RiskImpact on Agri-FoodSupplyChainPerformance in Malaysia,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3090092,Zaffa Zahari,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the key risk components (probability and consequence) and their respective thresholds affecting agri-food supply chain operations in Malaysia. In addition, it seeks to understand the relationship between the major risk sources and to fathom the risk/disruption impact on agri-food supply chain performance in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach – Cross-sectional survey data were collected using a structured questionnaire. The risks threshold associated with agri-food supply chain were categorized using the risk matrix scale and classification described in the Project Management Body of Knowledge (Project Management Institute, 2013). Next, the Pearson correlation was used to understand the relationship between the various risks and agri-food chain performance. Lastly, to investigate how firms’ supply chain operations have been affected by risks/disruptions, an ordinary least square regression model was employed to quantify the impact of some major risk sources on agri-food chain performance in Malaysia. Findings – The results in this paper show variations in risks’ probability, impact and threshold in agri-food supply chain. While risk sources such as periodic change in interest/exchange rate policies and volatility in customer demand are high-rated risks, uncertain land policies/tenure and poor quality control are low rated risks in the operations of the chain. The performance of the agri-food chain significantly but negatively correlates with all the major risks studied. Whereas demand, supply, weather, logistics/infrastructure and financial risk sources significantly undermined the chain’s performance, risks emerging from biological/ environmental, management/operational, policy/regulations and political-related issues insignificantly affect the performance of agri-food supply chain in Malaysia. Research limitations/implications – This research is an area biased. However, some insightful managerial implications can be drawn from this paper to manage agri-food chain operations in a similar unstable environment. The result implies that risks are inevitable in agri-food chain but they differ in terms of menace to the chain’s operation. Therefore, tomanage agri-food supply chain risks effectively, managers should periodically identify, quantify and categorize risk sources before making risk response decisions. In addition, the results show that risks account for about half of the overall agri-food chain performance in Malaysia. This infers that managers/ practitioners could improve the performance of the agri-food chain if limited resources are allocated to plan and effectively respond to major risks sources (such as demand, supply, finance, weather and logistical/ infrastructural services-related risks) undermining the performance of the chain. Originality/value – This research contributes to the agri-food chain risk literature and provides managers/ practitioners with empirical evidence of risk thresholds and their corresponding major impact on agri-food chain’s performance. Since risks explained about half of agri-food chain performance in Malaysia, this research would prompt decision makers to improve on their risk assessment and responds (e.g. by employing efficient demand, supply and weather forecasting systems, logistic/infrastructure services, hedge to finance, etc.) to improve the chain’s performance.",目的——本文旨在探讨影响马来西亚农产品供应链运营的关键风险要素（概率与后果）及其相应阈值，并试图理解主要风险源之间的关系，进而揭示风险/中断对马来西亚农产品供应链绩效的影响。设计/方法/路径——研究采用结构化问卷收集横截面调查数据，依据《项目管理知识体系指南》（美国项目管理协会，2013年）描述的风险矩阵尺度和分类方法对农产品供应链相关风险阈值进行归类。随后运用皮尔逊相关系数分析各类风险与农产品供应链绩效的关系。最后，为探究企业供应链运营受风险/中断影响的程度，研究采用普通最小二乘回归模型量化主要风险源对马来西亚农产品供应链绩效的冲击。研究发现——结果表明农产品供应链中各类风险的发生概率、影响程度及阈值存在显著差异。其中利率/汇率政策周期性变动和客户需求波动属于高风险等级，而土地政策/权属不确定性与质量控制薄弱则是低风险等级。研究显示所有主要风险均与供应链绩效呈显著负相关：需求、供应、天气、物流/基础设施及财务风险源显著削弱供应链绩效，而生物/环境、管理/运营、政策/法规及政治相关风险对马来西亚农产品供应链绩效的影响不显著。研究局限/启示——本研究存在地域局限性，但仍可为不稳定环境下的农产品供应链管理提供重要启示。结果表明风险在农产品供应链中不可避免，但对运营的威胁程度各异。管理者应定期识别、量化并分类风险源，再制定应对策略。研究发现风险因素解释了马来西亚农产品供应链绩效约50%的变异，这意味着若将有限资源配置于规划并有效应对主要风险源（如需求、供应、财务、天气及物流/基础设施服务相关风险），管理者可显著提升供应链绩效。原创性/价值——本研究丰富了农产品供应链风险领域的文献，为管理者提供了风险阈值及其对供应链绩效影响的实证依据。鉴于风险因素对马来西亚农产品供应链绩效的高解释度，本研究将促使决策者完善风险评估与响应机制（例如采用高效的需求、供应及天气预测系统，优化物流/基础设施服务，运用金融对冲工具等），从而提升供应链绩效。,"Performance, Supply chain, Malaysia, Risk, Agri-food",2018-08-24

supply chain risk,A Study on EffectiveSupplyChainRiskManagement: Conceptual Framework,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3000280,Sok-Tae Kim,"The objective of this study is to explore supply chain risk management (SCRM) and introduce an effective risk management conceptual framework for firms exposed to the global business environment. In order to survive in severe global competition, more firms have followed suit in their supply chain management by maintaining lean inventory (JIT), global partnership, and outsourcing. These practices have led firms to more disruptions in different nodes of the supply chain. Optimal balance between the cost of disruption and the cost of countermeasures has remained an unresolved issue for firms. This paper attempts to provide a conceptual framework to categorize firms according to their current maturity of SCRM into low, mid, and high levels. Any effective SCRM should be adopted according to the current risk management maturity level, in order to derive a higher economic effect in the context of a cost-benefit tradeoff. This framework is designed to resolve why some empirical studies on the performance of SCRM have mixed results inconsistent with their predictions.",本研究的目的是探讨供应链风险管理（SCRM），并为面临全球商业环境的企业引入一个有效的风险管理概念框架。为了在激烈的全球竞争中生存，越来越多的企业在供应链管理中效仿精益库存（JIT）、全球合作伙伴关系和外包等做法。这些实践导致企业在供应链的不同节点上面临更多中断。在中断成本与应对措施成本之间寻求最优平衡，仍是企业尚未解决的难题。本文试图提供一个概念框架，根据企业当前的SCRM成熟度将其分为低、中、高三个等级。任何有效的SCRM都应基于当前的风险管理成熟度水平来实施，以在成本效益权衡的背景下获得更高的经济效益。该框架旨在解释为何部分关于SCRM绩效的实证研究会出现与预测不一致的混合结果。,"Risk Index, Supply Chain Risk Management",2017-07-17

Fundamentally, they also should have a relationship with each other, as the supply chain connects to marketing's ""place.""  Supply chain provides the goods to meet the marketing demand. If this relationship is enhanced beyond the basic, however, this can contribute to revenue opportunities. If the supply chain provides enhanced services that customers can utilize, and if this is inserted into the marketing message to customers, then this can lead to increased customer acquisition and likely retention. Many companies neglect to highlight this enhanced service aspect in their promotion activities, and thus are missing an opportunity for customer preference and potentially revenue growth. This paper portrays an example of how the marketing message (at a major retailer) was redesigned to incorporate the promotion of a customer-oriented supply chain service, and provides evidence of the subsequent growth that occurred.","市场营销与供应链在公司内部各自承担着职能责任。从根本上说，二者也应存在关联，因为供应链连接着营销的""渠道""环节。供应链通过提供商品来满足营销需求。但若能强化这种基础关系，就能创造营收增长机会。当供应链提供客户可享的增值服务，并将此纳入面向客户的营销信息时，就能促进客户获取并提升留存率。许多企业在推广活动中忽视了对这类增值服务的宣传，因而错失了赢得客户青睐及潜在营收增长的机会。本文通过某大型零售商的案例，展示了如何重构营销信息以融入以客户为中心的供应链服务推广，并提供了由此带来业务增长的实际证据。","promotion, revenue, supply chain services, retail, customer preference, customer acquisition",2019-01-11

Survey data is derived from a sample of (small-scale) suppliers of local and regional food to a large British supermarket. Partial least squares regression analysis was used to test a conceptual framework, which positions relational justice as a mediator in the relationship between key customer categorization and supplier performance, moderated by the length of the relationship. Findings reveal that small suppliers who perceive their treatment by their key customers as fair tend to achieve higher business performance, which supports the hypothesized mediating role of relational justice on supplier performance. However, this research found no evidence to support the hypothesis that this role is moderated by the length of the relationship between the supplier and the buyer. This paper makes a novel empirical contribution, focusing on performance outcomes for small-scale suppliers in a highly competitive environment (fast-moving consumer goods) with customers (supermarkets) who have significant market power. Accordingly, the paper shows that the way supermarket buyers treat their suppliers matters more for the performance of their suppliers than the very fact that they are key customers.","本研究的目的是探讨感知关系公正对超市供应链中小型食品饮料生产商的关键客户分类与绩效之间关系的影响。调查数据来源于一家英国大型超市的本地及区域食品（小规模）供应商样本。研究采用偏最小二乘回归分析检验概念框架，该框架将关系公正定位为关键客户分类与供应商绩效之间的中介变量，并受到关系长度的调节。研究发现，认为关键客户对待自己公平的小型供应商往往能取得更高的业务绩效，这支持了关系公正对供应商绩效的中介作用假设。但研究未发现证据支持供应商与采购方关系长度会调节这一作用的假设。本文做出了新颖的实证贡献，重点关注具有显著市场权力的客户（超市）所在高度竞争环境（快速消费品）中小型供应商的绩效表现。研究表明，超市采购方对待供应商的方式比""其是关键客户""这一事实本身对供应商绩效的影响更为重要。","Supply-Chain Management, Customer Relationship Management, Supermarkets, UK, Company Performance, Food Industry",2019-02-28

supply chain risk,Toward aSupplyChainPractice View,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2927848,Craig Carter,"A growing body of supply chain management (SCM) literature has relied on the premises of the resource-based view (RBV) and its extensions like the relational view (RV) to investigate resources and their relationship to performance. Recently, the practice-based view (PBV) has been proposed as a complementary theoretical foundation for strategic management research. While the PBV primarily focuses on the firm, we note that SCM practices often span firm boundaries and extend to supply chain partners. In addition, there is an opportunity to explicitly consider firm performance as both individual performance and relational performance. We do this by proposing the supply chain practice view (SCPV), in which we extend the PBV to the interorganizational level of analysis — both in terms of practices and performance. We also build upon and extend the PBV's discussion of the interaction of practices and resources by advocating that there are no discrete boundaries between practices and resources and between firm and relational performance; we conceptualize these dimensions as continua as opposed to sets of dichotomies. The SCPV complements the PBV, as well as the RBV and RV, and provides an alternative theoretical lens for the SCM discipline.",越来越多的供应链管理(SCM)文献基于资源基础观(RBV)及其延伸理论如关系观(RV)的前提，研究资源及其与绩效的关系。近年来，实践基础观(PBV)被提出作为战略管理研究的补充理论基础。虽然PBV主要关注企业层面，但我们注意到SCM实践往往跨越企业边界延伸至供应链合作伙伴。此外，我们有机会将企业绩效明确区分为个体绩效和关系绩效。为此我们提出供应链实践观(SCPV)，将PBV的分析层次扩展到组织间层面——包括实践和绩效两个维度。我们还通过主张实践与资源之间、企业绩效与关系绩效之间不存在明确界限，对PBV关于实践与资源交互作用的讨论进行了拓展；我们将这些维度概念化为连续统而非二分集合。SCPV作为PBV、RBV和RV的补充理论，为SCM学科提供了新的理论视角。,"supply chain practice view (SCPV), resource-based view, relational view, practice-based view, supply chain performance, conceptual theory building",2017-03-07

This study examines supply chain relationship factors and cyber risk issues to better understand the demand for C-SCRM assurance. Resource Advantage Theory of Competition provides the conceptual foundation for assessing the dual drivers of relationship building and cyber risk management on demand for assurance. We use a field survey to collect data from 205 professionals enabling evaluation of the complex relationships in the theoretical model. Results support all hypotheses, provide satisfactory model fit, and support the underlying theory. Trust, power imbalances and cyber supply chain risk all positively influence the demand for assurance over C-SCRM processes, suggesting assurance is a desirable process for addressing the three greatest inhibitors of collaborative supply chain relationships. Two new constructs are also introduced in the research — a complex 49 item measure for assessing cyber supply chain risk across the technical, operational and strategic levels, along with a more traditional multi-item construct for assessing the a priori demand for assurance.

Specifically, using attribution theory, the authors study the influence of macro-level logistical capabilities of a host country on a firm’s actual and perceived supply chain risk, and examine if this country-level factor and the firm level perception of risk affect a firm’s decision-making in risk management. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a combination of primary data from 932 manufacturing firms from 22 countries and secondary data from the logistics performance index (LPI), and empirically tests the conceptual framework using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Findings: Key results reveal that a country’s logistical capabilities, measured using LPI, have a significant impact on managers’ risk perception. Firms located in countries with high LPI perceive lower risk in their supply chain both in the upstream and downstream, and therefore do not invest much in external integration, compared to firms in low LPI countries, and hence are exposed to high risk.

The resulting variety of complex transactions have made risk control and government supervision difficult. China's listed companies have specific classifications, but most non-listed companies do not have comparable classifications, making it difficult to analyze all companies on the same basis. Supply chain networks have proved to contain rich information, which can more completely reflect transaction relationships. This study mines hidden information obtained from the supply chain network to classify participating companies. We construct the supply chain network data set of listed companies using a graph neural network (GNN) algorithm to classify these companies. Experiments show that this method is effective and can produce better results than the commonly used machine learning methods. In addition, we use some economic variables to try to explain the effectiveness and economic significance of GNN, and find that GNN can also be used to classify companies into multiple industries.

supply chain risk,SupplyChainLeakage of Greenhouse Gas Emissions,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3717326,Sining Song,"Climate change has been a major global risk and a key driver for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction. Yet, internal emissions reduction of firms may create a leakage that leads to higher emissions in the supply chain. The related literature suggests that such emissions leakage is explained by the pollution haven hypothesis. We propose and find evidence for an alternative reason for supply chain leakage, one that is driven by innovation and optimization of supply chain activities. Using panel data from Bloomberg Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and Bloomberg Supply Chain (SPLC), we estimate our models at a firm and supplier dyadic level using two-way cluster robust standard error and dyadic robust error estimations, treating different sources of endogeneity. We find empirical evidence of a supply chain leakage effect – a higher level of supplier emissions is associated with a lower level of firm internal emissions. More importantly, supplier innovation can be a major driver behind the leakage – the supply chain leakage effect is heightened when a supplier is more innovative. Further, the role of innovation is strengthened when a supplier has similar technological capabilities to the focal firm. We also find that climate risk exposure impacts supply chain leakage in an asymmetrical pattern—focal firm climate risks heighten leakage while supplier climate risks mitigate leakage. Our findings suggest that supply chain leakage may not be completely driven by pollution haven motives, but by supply chain innovation and optimization that may be beneficial in the long term.",气候变化一直是全球面临的重大风险，也是推动温室气体减排的关键因素。然而，企业内部的减排行为可能导致供应链环节的排放泄漏。现有文献认为这种排放泄漏现象可以用污染避难所假说来解释。我们提出并验证了另一种驱动供应链泄漏的原因——由供应链活动创新与优化所引发的泄漏效应。基于彭博环境、社会与治理（ESG）数据库和彭博供应链（SPLC）数据库的面板数据，我们采用双向聚类稳健标准误和配对稳健误差估计方法，在企业-供应商配对层面构建模型，并处理了多种内生性问题。实证结果表明存在供应链泄漏效应：供应商排放水平越高，企业自身排放水平越低。更重要的是，供应商创新是泄漏效应的主要驱动力——当供应商创新水平较高时，供应链泄漏效应更为显著。若供应商与焦点企业具备相似的技术能力，创新对泄漏效应的驱动作用会进一步增强。我们还发现气候风险暴露对供应链泄漏存在非对称影响：焦点企业面临气候风险会加剧泄漏，而供应商面临气候风险则抑制泄漏。研究结果表明，供应链泄漏可能并非完全源于污染避难所动机，而是源于可能带来长期效益的供应链创新与优化。,"Climate risk, supply chain leakage, supply chain innovation, technology proximity, dyadic data analysis",2020-12-31

supply chain risk,Uncertainty andSupplyChainRisk: The Moderating Role ofSupplyChainFlexibility inRiskMitigation,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5231062,Sreedevi R,"In order to remain competitive in the market, firms are forced to expand their product offerings and offer high levels of customization, bringing about high uncertainty in their supply chain. Firms that face high environmental uncertainty are increasingly facing higher risks in terms of supply disruptions, production and delivery delays that ultimately result in poor operational performance. This study aims at understanding the antecedents of supply chain operational risk faced by firms and the conditions under which such risks can be mitigated. Using Indian data from the sixth edition of International Manufacturing Strategy Survey (IMSS) and structural equation modeling, we investigate the relationships between environmental uncertainty and supply chain risk and the moderating effect of supply chain flexibility. We identify appropriate types of flexibility to mitigate the three major aspects of supply chain risk: supply risk, manufacturing process risk and delivery risk. Our empirical investigation reveals that uncertainty in the supply chain leads to high supply chain risk; and in uncertain environments, supply and manufacturing flexibility help in reducing the supply and manufacturing process risks respectively. However, our results also indicate that, in emerging markets such as India where logistic infrastructure is less developed, internal capabilities alone may not be sufficient in reducing supply chain delivery risk. Our findings not only contribute towards filling certain gaps in the supply chain risk management literature, but also provide practicing managers and researchers a better understanding of the types of flexibility that can mitigate supply chain risk in different business environments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",为保持市场竞争力，企业被迫扩大产品种类并提供高度定制化服务，这导致供应链面临高度不确定性。面对高环境不确定性的企业，正日益遭遇供应中断、生产与交付延迟等更高风险，最终造成运营绩效下滑。本研究旨在探究企业供应链运营风险的成因及其缓解条件。基于第六版国际制造战略调查（IMSS）的印度数据及结构方程模型，我们检验了环境不确定性与供应链风险的关系，以及供应链柔性的调节作用。我们识别出能缓解供应链三大风险（供应风险、制造过程风险与交付风险）的柔性类型。实证研究表明：供应链不确定性会推高供应链风险；在不确定环境下，供应柔性和制造柔性分别有助于降低供应风险与制造过程风险。但研究同时发现，在印度等物流基础设施欠发达的新兴市场，仅靠内部能力可能不足以降低供应链交付风险。本研究成果不仅填补了供应链风险管理文献的某些空白，还为从业管理者和研究者提供了对不同商业环境下缓解供应链风险的柔性类型的深入认知。© 2017 Elsevier B.V.,"Environmental uncertainty, Supply chain flexibility, Supply chain risk",2025-04-28
supply chain risk,Transferring and Sharing Exchange-RateRiskin aRisk-AverseSupplyChainof a. Multinational Firm,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2341941,Kyoung-Kuk Kim,"This paper analyzes risk management contracts used to handle currency risk in a decentralized supply chain that consists of risk-averse divisions in a multinational firm. Particular contracts of interest involve transferring risk to a third party by using risk-transfer contracts such as currency options and re-arranging risk between supply chain members using risk-sharing contracts. Due to decentralization, operational and risk management decisions are made locally; however, a headquarter who is interested in total supply chain profit has some controllability over those activities. We question if each kind of risk management contract can improve the utility of all supply chain members compared to the utility without any of those, and how the conditions to achieve such improvements are different. Further structural differences are investigated via sensitivity analysis with respect to the transfer price, the variability of exchange rates, and the location of the headquarter. We also find that using the two kinds of contracts jointly does not necessarily result in better outcomes.",本文分析了用于处理由跨国企业中风险规避部门组成的分散式供应链中货币风险的风险管理合同。特别关注的合同包括通过使用风险转移合同（如货币期权）将风险转移给第三方，以及通过风险分担合同在供应链成员之间重新分配风险。由于分散化，运营和风险管理决策由各分部自主制定；然而，关注供应链整体利润的总部对这些活动具有一定控制权。我们探讨了相比不采用任何风险管理合同的情况，每种风险管理合同是否都能提升所有供应链成员的效用，以及实现这种提升的条件有何差异。通过针对转移定价、汇率波动性和总部所在地的敏感性分析，进一步研究了结构差异。我们还发现，同时使用两种合同并不必然带来更好的结果。,supply chain management; currency risk management; risk-transfer; risk-sharing; multinational,2013-10-19

Semiconductor industry provides various necessary technologies such as IoT, AI, modern fabrication technologies and so on to various industries including automotive industry, electronic and communication industry, healthcare industry, construction and building industry, space industry, and so on. However, semiconductor supply chain experiences various supply chain related risks and challenges because of its procedural complexities, global supply chain integrations, government policy and regulations, competitiveness, technological complexities, and so on. Not many studies available which investigated the risk, resilience, and complexities regarding green supply chain adoption in semiconductor industry. In this context, the objective of this study is to examine the risks, resilience, and complexities for managing the green supply chain adoption for higher sustainability in the semiconductor industry. Utilizing the TOE framework (Technology-Organization-Environment) and DCV (Dynamic Capability View), we developed a research model to achieve this purpose. Subsequently, this model was validated through structural equation modelling, involving 356 respondents affiliated with the semiconductor industry. The research reveals a substantial influence of organizational dynamic capabilities, coupled with government policies and regulations, on the adoption of GSCM (green supply chain management) within the semiconductor industry.

supply chain risk,QualityRiskin Outsourcing: Noncontractible Product Quality and Private Quality Cost Information,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1121444,Murat Kaya,"This paper addresses the concept of quality risk in outsourcing. Recent trends in outsourcing extend a contract manufacturer's (CM's) responsibility to several functional areas such as research and development and design in addition to manufacturing. This trend enables an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to focus on sales and pricing of its product. However, increasing CM responsibilities also suggest that the OEM's product quality is mainly determined by its CM. We identify two factors that cause quality risk in this outsourcing relationship. First, the CM and the OEM may not be able to contract on quality; second, the OEM may not know the cost of quality to the CM. We characterize the effects of these two quality risk factors on the firms' profits and on the resulting product quality. We determine how the OEM's pricing strategy affects quality risk. We show, for example, that the effect of noncontractible quality is higher than the effect of private quality cost information when the OEM sets the sales price after observing the product's quality. We also show that committing to a sales price mitigates the adverse effect of quality risk. To obtain these results, we develop and analyze a three-stage decision model. This model is also used to understand the impact of recent information technologies on profits and product quality. For example, we provide a decision tree that an OEM can use in deciding whether to invest in an enterprise-wide quality management system that enables accounting of quality related activities across the supply chain.",本文探讨了外包中的质量风险概念。近年来，外包趋势将合同制造商（CM）的责任从生产扩展到研发、设计等多个职能领域。这一趋势使原始设备制造商（OEM）能够专注于产品销售和定价。然而，CM责任的增加也意味着OEM的产品质量主要由其CM决定。我们识别出导致这种外包关系中质量风险的两个因素：一是CM与OEM可能无法就质量签订合同；二是OEM可能不了解CM的质量成本。我们分析了这两个质量风险因素对企业利润和最终产品质量的影响，并确定了OEM定价策略如何影响质量风险。例如，研究表明当OEM在观察到产品质量后设定销售价格时，不可签约质量的影响大于私有质量成本信息的影响。我们还证明，预先承诺销售价格能减轻质量风险的负面影响。为获得这些结论，我们开发并分析了一个三阶段决策模型。该模型也可用于理解最新信息技术对利润和产品质量的影响。例如，我们提供了一个决策树，帮助OEM决定是否投资于全企业范围的质量管理系统——该系统能实现供应链中质量相关活动的核算。,"quality risk, quality effort, outsourcing, contracting, quality management, supply chain management",2008-04-30

In this environment, the optimization issue arises how to best comply with the different regulations and reaching cost efficiency at the same time. In this research, the international regulatory landscape for Supply Chain risks of Financial Institutions is introduced and compared internationally. It is understood as an integral part of Supply Chain Risk Management of Financial Institutions, yet the latter is analysed as the research background. Additionally, expert interviews are conducted in order to link the regulation analysis to the current challenges that Financial Institutions face. Finally, recommendations are developed on how banks can be cost efficient, while remaining regulatory compliant, facing increased international regulation in the area of Supply Chain Risk Management. The outcome of the underlying research shows that banking regulation in the area of Supply Chain risks is an important lever in the banking sector to secure customers and financial markets. However, the regulatory landscape is heterogeneous and not consistent on an international scale. Regulation in Asia is highly diverse across different countries due to different states of economic development. The US applies a rather pragmatical approach towards supply chain risk regulation applying different standards of standard setting institutions. Lastly, the EU is very restrictive and strives to unify regulation across member states.

supply chain risk,SupplyChainCoordination for E-Commerce:RiskPenalty vs. Flat Rate,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3129499,Ju Myung Song,"1. Problem Definition: We study the coordination of an E-commerce supply chain between online sellers and 3rd party shippers to meet random demand surges, induced by, for instance, online shopping holidays.2. Academic/Practical Relevance: Motivated by the challenge of meeting the highly unpredictable demand surges in E-commerce, we study shipping contracts and supply chain coordination between online sellers and 3rd party shippers in a novel model taking the unique features of the shipping industry into account.3. Methodology: We compare two shipping contracts: the risk penalty (recently proposed by UPS) and the flat rate (used by FedEx), and analyze their impact on the seller, the shipper, and the supply chain.4. Results: We discover that against the common belief, the sophisticated risk penalty is not much better than the simple flat rate for the shipper. Although both the risk penalty and the flat rate can coordinate the supply chain, the risk penalty does so only if the shipper makes zero profit, but the flat rate can provide a positive profit for both. These results represent a new form of double marginalization and risk-sharing, in sharp contrast to the well-known literature on the classic supplier-retailer supply chain, where risk-sharing contracts (similar to the risk penalty) can bring benefits to all parties, but the single wholesale price contract (similar to the flat rate) can achieve supply chain coordination only when the supplier makes zero profit. We also find that only the online seller, but not the shipper, has the motivation to vertically integrate the seller-shipper supply chain.5. Managerial Implications: Coordinating the seller-shipper supply chain is an important way to meet the unpredictable demand surges in E-commerce. Our results imply that the risk penalty is unnecessarily complex because the simple flat rate is just as good as the risk penalty for the shipper and is better for the seller-shipper supply chain as a whole. Our study also explains and supports the recent practice of online sellers (e.g., Amazon.com and JD.com), but not shippers, to vertically integrate the supply chain by consistently expanding their shipping capabilities.",1. 问题定义：我们研究在线卖家与第三方承运商之间电商供应链的协调机制，以应对由网络购物节等活动引发的随机需求激增。  . 2. 学术/实践意义：基于电商领域高度不可预测的需求激增挑战，我们在考虑航运业独特特征的新模型中，研究在线卖家与第三方承运商之间的运输合同及供应链协调机制。  . 3. 研究方法：我们比较两种运输合同——风险惩罚（近期由UPS提出）与统一费率（FedEx采用），并分析其对卖家、承运商及供应链的影响。  . 4. 研究结果：与普遍认知相反，我们发现对承运商而言，复杂的风险惩罚合同并不比简单的统一费率优越。虽然两种合同均可协调供应链，但风险惩罚仅在承运商零利润时有效，而统一费率能使双方均获得正利润。这些结果呈现了一种新型的双重边际化与风险分担形式，与经典供应商-零售商供应链文献形成鲜明对比——在传统模型中，风险分担合同（类似风险惩罚）能使各方获益，而单一批发价合同（类似统一费率）仅在供应商零利润时实现供应链协调。我们还发现，只有在线卖家（而非承运商）有动机对卖家-承运商供应链进行垂直整合。  . 5. 管理启示：协调卖家-承运商供应链是应对电商不可预测需求激增的重要途径。结果表明风险惩罚合同过于复杂，因为对承运商而言统一费率同样有效，且对整个卖家-承运商供应链更有利。本研究也解释并支持了近期在线卖家（如亚马逊、京东）持续扩展物流能力以垂直整合供应链的实践，而承运商则无此动机。,"online retailing, shipping contracts, supply chain coordination, risk-sharing, flat rate",2018-03-05
supply chain risk,RiskPropagation through Payment Distortion inSupplyChains,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1707728,Alejandro Serrano,"The supply chain literature has devoted much attention to studying how the variability of orders propagates upstream. We explore how this insight extends to the variability of payments to suppliers and its impact on how risk is generated and propagates upstream. To do so, we model the financial features of a supply chain based on industry reports and empirical findings from the finance literature. Capturing policies and constraints of the agents in the supply chain in a formal model, we are able to generate and explain the behavior observed in real supply chains. We show that payment variability occurs and propagates, even if orders are constant, in a cash-constrained supply chain. Furthermore, our model reveals that payment variability may even become amplified under severe cash restrictions. We identify the factors that drive the propagation of variability-the industry risk, the firm's operational leverage, the existence of a financial leverage target, and the cost of debt.

In recent years and with the perceived national security threat posed by a burgeoning China, the U.S. has dramatically expanded a set of extraterritorial rules in its existing export control restrictions. This Article evaluates such expansion of export control extraterritoriality in the context of waning trade multilateralism. It first provides a doctrinal examination of the development of extraterritoriality in U.S. export control, focusing on the recent intensification of U.S.-China technology decoupling, exemplified through the expansion of end-use control and extraterritorial jurisdiction over U.S. persons. Then, by drawing upon recent literature on geoeconomic trade law, the Article argues that a revitalized priority on security-oriented trade policy making will justify this expansion of export control extraterritoriality together with ally-based enforcement exception rules. Nonetheless, expansion of export control extraterritoriality will easily be a slippery slope, potentially initiating retaliatory cycles. Without a multilateral solution, it risks a dramatic realignment of international trade into blocks of allies and/or regions, thereby undermining decades of achievements in neo-liberal trade and hurting its leadership in a rules-based order. The Article concludes by reflecting on remaining multilateralist avenues to rule on export extraterritoriality when new trade dispute arises, in light of a few recent WTO DSB reform proposals.",历史上，美国依据其出口管制法主张域外管辖权引发了大量学术讨论。近年来，随着中国崛起带来的国家安全威胁加剧，美国大幅扩展了现有出口管制中的域外适用规则。本文在贸易多边主义式微的背景下评估这种出口管制域外管辖权的扩张。首先从学理层面梳理美国出口管制域外管辖权的发展脉络，聚焦近期美中技术脱钩加剧的态势，通过扩大最终用途管制和对美国公民的域外管辖等典型案例展开分析。随后借助地缘经济贸易法领域的最新研究成果，本文论证以安全为导向的贸易政策制定重新成为优先事项，将为这种域外管辖权扩张及盟友豁免执行规则提供正当性依据。然而出口管制域外管辖权的扩张极易形成滑坡效应，可能引发报复性循环。若无多边解决方案，或将导致国际贸易格局按盟友阵营和/或地区区块剧烈重组，从而破坏数十年新自由主义贸易成果，并损害基于规则的国际秩序领导力。文章最后结合近期若干WTO争端解决机制改革提案，探讨在新贸易争端出现时规制出口域外管辖权的剩余多边主义路径。,"Export Control, U.S.-China Relations, Extraterritoriality, Geoeconomic Trade Order, Dispute Settlement",2024-02-12

Central to international regulatory harmonisation is the Wassenaar Arrangement concerning export controls for conventional arms as well as for dual-use goods and technologies. Institutionalised regulatory coordination through multilateral regimes is essential, in part because the multilateral trade regime accommodates apologetic security exceptions that flexibly allow each member’s own export control practices. Multilateralism in the context of dual-use export control has been subject to various political and normative challenges, however.

Therefore,  the study was aimed at devising a viable non-oil export-led growth policy. Study covered the period 1980 to 2014. Data were sourced from Central Bank of Nigeria,  National Bureau of Statistics and World  Development  Indicators.  This study revealed a preferred choice for a more robust factor analytic model to isolate potent factors influencing non-oil export–growth nexus in Nigeria.  Results indicate that there was positive significant relationship between non-oil export and growth in Nigeria which was solely attributable to the influence of foreign direct investment and trade liberalization.

This Note discusses the penalty guidance that Commerce uses to determine appropriate levels of administrative penalties. It argues that one factor, the corporate culture of the offending company, which is relegated by Commerce to an aggravating or mitigating circumstance is actually vitally important in achieving the goals of export enforcement - deserving far more than its treatment as an aggravating or mitigating circumstance.

Many States worldwide adopted temporary restrictions on exports of certain medical goods and some foodstuffs to mitigate actual or potential shortages of critical supplies. 98 States out of 130 adopted temporary measures affecting trade since the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020. The measures range from export bans to licensing requirements and the right of first refusal for the exporting country's government.The high number of States adopting some form of export control concerning the so-called ""COVID goods.""  entails exploring the phenomenon to understand better the legitimacy of the measures in the multilateral framework of the WTO and their impact on the global trading system. The practice of the European Union in this matter is particularly interesting. The EU was one of the first regional areas heavily hit by the COVID-19 and its Member States among the first nations adopting export control measures. At the very beginning of the pandemic, some EU member States adopted export restrictions affecting intra-EU trade. The risk of a race to close the borders to essential goods in the internal market, a heavily integrated space, urged the Commission to take action to preserve the integrity of the single market and the free movement of goods, introducing a mechanism of control of exports of COVID goods to non-EU countries as a quid pro quo for the 'full and effective lifting of all forms of internal bans or restrictions within the internal market.The EU Member States briefly experienced the freedom to adopt export restrictions at the pandemic's beginning unilaterally. Then, thanks to a political agreement between them and the Commission, the limitations in adopting export control measures according to a uniform export authorisation scheme regulated and supervised by the Commission.This paper aims at studying the export control regime for COVID-19 vaccines adopted by the EU at the end of January 2021 and still in place at the time of writing. The case of restrictions in the trade of vaccines is particularly interesting considering the quite unanimous consensus in the international community that to bring this pandemic to an end, vaccines must be available to people in all countries and not just in producer ones. Restrictions on the trade of vaccines aim at protecting the population of the producer countries adopting them, but at the same time leaving alone the countries without vaccine production capacity means to delay the recovery for all. Furthermore, vaccine production is highly specialised and concentrated in few countries; keeping markets open is a condition to distribute vaccines broadly. The EU export control regime will be analysed and compared with the export control policies adopted by other major producers of the COVID-19 vaccines to assess its impact on the global distribution of such vaccines.","新冠疫情危机的一个副作用是出口限制措施的重新抬头。为缓解关键物资的实际或潜在短缺，全球许多国家都对某些医疗用品和部分食品实施了临时出口限制。自2020年疫情暴发以来，130个国家中有98个采取了影响贸易的临时措施，这些措施包括出口禁令、许可证制度以及出口国政府优先采购权等。如此多国家对所谓""抗疫物资""实施某种形式的出口管制，需要我们深入探究这一现象，以更好地理解这些措施在世贸组织多边框架内的合法性及其对全球贸易体系的影响。. . 欧盟在这方面的实践尤为引人关注。作为最早遭受疫情重创的地区之一，其成员国率先实施了出口管制措施。疫情初期，部分欧盟成员国出台的出口限制影响了欧盟内部贸易。在这个高度一体化的市场内，重要物资边境封锁竞赛的风险促使欧盟委员会采取行动维护单一市场完整性和货物自由流动，通过建立对非欧盟国家抗疫物资出口的管控机制，换取""全面有效取消内部市场所有形式的禁令或限制""。. . 欧盟成员国在疫情初期曾短暂享有单方面实施出口限制的自由，随后通过成员国与欧盟委员会的政治协商，转为依照欧盟委员会监管的统一出口授权机制实施管制。本文旨在研究欧盟于2021年1月底出台且截至撰稿时仍在实施的疫苗出口管制制度。考虑到国际社会普遍共识——要终结疫情就必须让所有国家（而不仅是生产国）民众获得疫苗，对疫苗贸易的限制尤其值得探讨。这类限制虽能保护实施国的民众，却使无疫苗生产能力的国家陷入困境，最终将延缓全球复苏进程。加之疫苗生产高度专业化且集中在少数国家，保持市场开放是实现疫苗广泛分配的前提。本文将分析欧盟出口管制制度，并与其他主要新冠疫苗生产国的出口政策进行比较，评估其对疫苗全球分配的影响。","COVID-19 crisis, European Union response, Export control measures, External trade restrictions, Export authorization schemes",2021-08-11

The cost of these measures, which lead to global shortages, will be counted in human lives. Yet the multilateral trade regime lacks effective legal disciplines on export restrictions. In response, scholars have pinned their hopes on the prospect of potential retaliation working as a deterrent. Are such hopes warranted? Early evidence suggests not: the threat of retaliation cannot effectively deter most export controls, because the most flagrant country users are also shielded by the very characteristics that render them prone to imposing export restraints in the first place. The empirical evidence indicates the prospect of retaliation has played no role in the decision to restrict exports by the world’s biggest exporters of essential medical goods. Yet autarky is unlikely to be a workable solution to assure domestic supply. I suggest that attempts at limiting market consolidation of essential goods may be one way of reducing the incentive to implement export controls in the first place.",新冠疫情全球大流行已导致约75个国家限制出口数百种产品，从抗生素、口罩到医用呼吸机不一而足。这些引发全球短缺的措施将以生命为代价。然而现行多边贸易体制对出口限制缺乏有效法律约束。对此，学者们寄望于潜在报复行为可能产生的威慑作用。这种期望能否成立？早期证据显示答案是否定的：报复威胁无法有效阻止多数出口管制，因为最肆无忌惮实施限制的国家，恰恰受到那些促使其采取限制措施的特质的保护。实证研究表明，在全球主要医疗物资出口国实施出口限制的决策中，报复前景并未产生任何影响。但自给自足并非保障国内供应的可行方案。我认为，限制关键物资市场集中度或许是减少出口限制初始动机的可行之策。,"COVID-19, export restrictions, PPE, retaliation, trade, WTO",2020-06-10

However, those measures are gradually emerging as a source of contention of being more offensive in the recent international trade conflicts. Due to the national security significance, Arm and dual-use export controls are not governed by the World Trade Organisation but by several political-oriented international regimes. This paper provides a historical overview of the normative and functional development of the multilateral dual-use export control regime (CoCom and its successor Wassenaar Arrangement), whose functions, guidelines, processes and dual-use list structure have become the foundation of many national and regional export control policies. By tracking this multilateral regime’s seventy-year evolution history, this paper also reveals that the US has had a hegemonic influence on the decision-making of dual-use export control rules ever since the CoCom period, and points out that, the reformed institutional functions in WA has shown a trend of shifting from political cooperation framework to a more legalized regime respecting the rule of law.

export control,ExportControls in the People's Republic of China,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1918230,Jonathan E. Davis,"This report provides a comprehensive overview of China's system of nonproliferation export controls, including the system's legal basis, its licensing and enforcement programs, government-to-industry outreach and China's participation in the international nonproliferation export control regimes.  Throughout, the report highlights recent developments and remaining challenges in along each of these dimensions. The report concludes that Chinese export controls, after a period of fits and starts, are at last entering an era of maturity that promises dividends for the international nonproliferation regime.  Still, export control development in China must be viewed in perspective, and China remains a comparative newcomer to nonproliferation export controls. As recently as the mid-1990s, Chinese export controls were a pastiche of ad hoc nonproliferation policies and opaque administrative regulations, and Chinese entities - predominantly state-owned at that time - were engaged in a wide range of transfers of goods and technology that directly or indirectly contributed to a number of countries' WMD and missile programs. Since then, driven in part by self-interest and in part by coercion, China has developed more pragmatic nonproliferation policies and established a de jure export control system based on transparent and international-standard laws and regulations. Chinese proliferation challenges in the 1980s and 1990s - including state-sanctioned proliferation, insufficient and opaque export control procedures, weak political will to adhere to nonproliferation pledges and a combative and aloof attitude toward the multilateral export control regimes - have diminished or been eliminated to a great degree. Although problems remain, it would be inaccurate to say that these are new proliferation challenges.  Rather, it is the legacy of previous challenges that continues to affect the implementation of Chinese export controls today. While China’s recent export control progress has eroded the severity of a number of proliferation issues, it has placed into greater relief a number of issues that formerly went unnoticed.  Because of this, it may appear to some observers that the persistence of challenges, albeit different ones today than in the past, demonstrates that China has failed to make progress toward implementing nonproliferation export controls. Alternatively, other observers may perceive the unrelenting identification of export control problems as the product of implacable critics of Chinese nonproliferation policy who evaluate the PRC against an inconstant, unfair metric of success.

We need a detailed interpretation of the clause that can be used to distinguish measures permissible under the clause from impermissible ones. This paper presents an interpretation of the article based on existing arguments, especially those of the DS512 Panel Report, that deny the self-judging nature of the clause. It analyses how a panel should apply the principle of good faith with regard to the chapeau of the article and then interprets each component of subparagraph (ii), which concerns the taking of actions considered necessary to protect essential security interests “relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war and to such traffic in other goods and materials as is carried on directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment”. Relying on tools such as the drafting history, authoritative interpretations of other parts of WTO law, and the structure and context of the article, the paper proposes the following criteria for determining measures that do not satisfy the requirement of the latter half of the subparagraph: the likelihood that the restricted trade item could get to a military establishment, its military sensitivity and scope of use, and the existence of military tension involving the invoking country.

Sisay,"Globalization forces companies to internationalize their operation in the global market. Exporting plays a vital role in economic development of a nation as well as for the development of the particular exporting company. Although, the benefits derived from exporting in an increasingly globalized marketplace are enormous, but for many companies, exporting is constrained by numerous challenges. The purpose of the study was to assess export marketing challenges of Ethiopian vegetable and fruit commercial growers. The study investigated 20 Ethiopian vegetable and fruit commercial growers and 8 stakeholders with questionnaires and interviews. The research utilized a mixed research design and analysis techniques specifically concurrent embedded approach. It is found out that the Ethiopian vegetable and fruit commercial growers export volume and sales lacks consistency and constrained by different challenges. Of the major challenges which were classified as internal barriers and external barriers, macro environmental barriers highly affected the growers. Local investors were highly affected by both the internal and external problems whereas foreign and joint ventures are affected in some extent with those problems. Less experienced growers were highly affected by the export problems than those who are more experienced. Management commitment problem; technological advancement problem; financial; lack of accessible transport system; low awareness of stakeholders; seasonality of Ethiopian supply; shortage of cargo; shortage of infrastructure; government bureaucracy; lack of potential markets; and shortage of inputs were identified as problems for the vegetable and fruit export. Therefore, to minimize these problems creating enabling policy environment; fair and competitive air freight cost; the growers to incorporate challenges in their export marketing strategy; the government to explore new markets, provide technical supports and long-term loans to growers; to create new competitive input suppliers; integration of stakeholders of the sector; and to recruit skilled manpower are forwarded as recommendations.",全球化迫使企业在全球市场中拓展其业务。出口对国家的经济发展以及特定出口企业的发展起着至关重要的作用。尽管在日益全球化的市场环境中，出口带来的利益巨大，但对许多企业而言，出口仍受到诸多挑战的制约。本研究旨在评估埃塞俄比亚蔬菜和水果商业种植者面临的出口营销挑战。研究通过问卷调查和访谈调查了20家埃塞俄比亚蔬菜和水果商业种植者及8家相关利益方，采用混合研究设计和分析方法，特别是并行嵌入式方法。研究发现，埃塞俄比亚蔬菜和水果商业种植者的出口量和销售额缺乏稳定性，并受到不同挑战的制约。在主要挑战中，分为内部障碍和外部障碍，宏观环境障碍对种植者的影响尤为显著。本地投资者受到内部和外部问题的严重影响，而外资和合资企业则在一定程度上受这些问题影响。经验较少的种植者比经验丰富的种植者更易受到出口问题的困扰。管理承诺问题、技术进步问题、资金问题、缺乏便捷的运输系统、利益相关方意识不足、埃塞俄比亚供应的季节性、货运短缺、基础设施不足、政府官僚主义、缺乏潜在市场以及投入品短缺被确定为蔬菜和水果出口的主要问题。因此，为减少这些问题，建议创造有利的政策环境、公平且有竞争力的航空货运成本、种植者将挑战纳入出口营销战略、政府开拓新市场并为种植者提供技术支持和长期贷款、建立新的竞争性投入品供应商、整合行业利益相关方以及招募熟练劳动力。,"Marketing Challenges, Ethiopian Vegetable and Fruit Export, Export Challenges, Ethiopia, Export Marketing Challenges",2019-05-03

We provide a Ricardian-based theoretical explanation of countries’ relative export variety as a function of the level of technology and country size assessed with respect to the rest of the world.

The model predictions are confirmed in a sample of 132 countries (1988–2014), including 53 low-income countries, for which we measure export variety using product-level trade data. The influence of technology differences on export variety is: (i) stronger than is the effect of cross-country differences in size and (ii) non-linear, driving diversification at the beginning of the development process.

Using China’s custom data, we show that having diverse related export markets facilitates regional export growth due to knowledge spillovers among manufacturers and economies of scope for trade intermediaries. Having many unrelated export markets, however, has a negative impact on regional export growth, as it dilutes valuable resources. Furthermore, we highlight the role of trade intermediaries, which have been less studied than manufacturers in literature on export market diversification.",现有文献发现，地理多样化与经济绩效之间存在正向和负向双重关联。我们的研究有助于调和此类矛盾结论，并强调这种冲突与出口市场间的关联性有关。基于中国海关数据，我们证明：由于制造商间的知识溢出和贸易中介的范围经济效应，拥有多样化的相关出口市场能促进地区出口增长；而大量不相关出口市场则会因稀释宝贵资源而对地区出口增长产生负面影响。此外，我们重点揭示了贸易中介的作用——在出口市场多样化的文献中，该群体较制造商所受关注显著不足。,"related variety of export markets, unrelated variety of export markets, export market diversification, export growth",2023-02-15

This article uses a panel data of thirty-four importing countries from 2001 to 2011. Three main export growth factors are analysed in the model: (i) core factors ( income per capita, population, and distance); (ii) implicit behind-the-border constraints; and (iii) implicit beyond-the -border constraints. The findings show that only half of the country's export potential has been realized to date and export losses can primarily be attributed to implicit behind-the-border constraints. At the same time, these constraints have been reduced during the last decade. This article identifies border trade, a common language, income per capita and the Generalized System of Preferences scheme as important factors for export growth.

Its magnitude and response to global change are poorly quantified due to limited direct observation, especially in China. Here we compiled a database from 462 headwaters across China, primary based on our own observation, and applied a generalized additive model (GAM) to quantify terrestrial DOC export from 2000 to 2020. Our results reveal substantial underestimations in current assessments relying on riverine data. Over this period, terrestrial DOC export averaged 13.4 ± 1.5 Tg C yr−1, accounting for approximately 10% of national net biome productivity (NBP). Projections under SSP2-4.5 and carbon-neutral scenarios suggest an increase to 17.1 Tg C yr−1 in 2060, driven by decreasing atmospheric deposition and rising temperatures.

This article considers how Canadian export control law deals with technologies that negatively impact human rights abroad and identifies a gap in the existing export control scheme. We suggest this gap could be closed by adopting a proactive human rights due diligence requirement on companies seeking to export products under Canadian law. There is existing precedent in other jurisdictions for imposing a human rights due diligence requirement on companies more broadly as a matter of law.

Our findings reveal a significant decline in Korean semiconductor exports following the October 2022 imposition of US controls. This decline was most pronounced in the memory, discrete devices, and discrete device components subsectors of the semiconductor industry. In addition, we observed a decrease in unit prices, especially for memory semiconductors, pointing to downward pressure on South Korea’s high-value-added semiconductor exports.

The article applies the concept of institutional corruption, which is defined as a systemic or strategic influence that undermines an institution’s effectiveness by diverting it from its purpose. The article discusses the German arms export regime, examines the characteristics of the German weapons industry, and then goes on to analyze the strategic influence exerted by the German arms industry through the lens of the concept of institutional corruption. It discusses a range of practices associated with this concept, for example the so-called revolving door phenomenon and contributions to political parties, and their consequences for the regime’s trustworthiness. Finally, this article discusses the role of secrecy in making the German arms export regime more vulnerable to institutional corruption, and lays the basis for reform proposals. By using the concept of institutional corruption, this article sheds light on aspects of the issue that have long been ignored and connects the dots between lack of parliamentary control and of political transparency, and insufficient regulation of lobbying activities and other forms of interrelationships between politics and the industry. This article comes to the conclusion that both secrecy within the authorization regime and lack of transparency regarding corporate attempts to exert influence are causing the arms export regime to be extremely vulnerable to institutional corruption, since supervision and control by political and civil society actors are effectively limited.","本文分析了军火工业在德国武器出口管制体系中的作用，并探讨了行业利益的不当影响是否导致该体系偏离最初限制性功能的观点。文章运用了制度性腐败的概念——即系统性或战略性影响通过偏离制度初衷而削弱其效力的现象。研究首先梳理德国武器出口管制体系，考察德国军工产业特征，随后从制度性腐败视角分析德国军火工业施加的战略影响，探讨了与此概念相关的一系列实践（如""旋转门""现象和政党捐款）及其对体系公信力的影响。最后，文章论述保密机制如何加剧德国武器出口体系对制度性腐败的脆弱性，并为改革方案奠定基础。通过制度性腐败理论框架，本研究揭示了长期被忽视的问题维度，将议会监督缺位、政治透明度不足与游说活动监管不力等政商关联现象联系起来。文章得出结论：审批体系内部的保密机制与企业施加影响的非透明性，导致武器出口体系极易受到制度性腐败侵蚀，因为政治行为体和公民社会的监督效力受到实质性限制。","Institutional corruption, revolving door, donations, campaign finance, arms industry, weapons exports, Bundestag, democratic control, Bundessicherheitsrat, Federal Security Council, Germany, transparency, secrecy, military-industrial complex, lobbyism, influence, export authorization, export control",2014-08-08

However, in the process of industrialized society, the environmental situation has become increasingly severe, the world's attention to green development has been increasing, and countries continue to improve environmental protection policies, with a view to achieving the dual goals of economic and environmental protection. This paper selects the micro data of listed textile and garment companies from 2001 to 2023, and empirically explores the impact of command-and-control environmental regulation on the export behavior of listed Chinese textile and garment companies in each province by using Heckman's two-step method and an econometric regression model. In addition, this paper conducts a robustness test on the regression results and examines the mechanism role of R&D investment in the relationship.The empirical results show that the command-and-control environmental regulation does not have a significant impact on the export decision of listed textile and garment enterprises, The empirical results support the applicability of the “pollution paradise hypothesis” in China.

export control,U.S.ExportControls of AI Models,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4741033,Doni Bloomfield,"Artificial intelligence models may pose serious risks in the coming years. In this paper, taking biosecurity risks as a case study, I provide an overview of what U.S. export control laws are, how they currently address AI biosecurity risks, and how they might be used to reduce such risks in the future. I make two main arguments. First, model developers and deployers may face substantial liability under current export control rules if their AI models materially assist anyone in the development or deployment of biological weapons. Second, the export control agencies likely have the statutory and regulatory authority to restrict model developers from (1) making the model weights of frontier models freely available for download, and (2) allowing their models to convey certain forms of dangerous expertise. Although both rules could face substantial First Amendment challenges, courts are likely to uphold narrowly targeted regulations that are well justified on national security grounds. In addition, courts are more likely to uphold controls on generative models that perform technical biological work—known as biological design tools (BDTs)—than controls on models, such as large language models (LLMs), with more traditionally expressive output If and when it is advisable to regulate AI models, U.S. export controls represent one ready, if imperfect tool to mitigate biosecurity risks. Export control rules govern the movement of U.S.-made products around the world, certain actions of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, and the transfer of U.S. technical information to foreign persons. These laws are flexible, backed by substantial criminal sanction, and generally exempt from stringent judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act. The Commerce and State Departments have extensive leeway to use these laws as they see fit. Export controls have also been used for many decades to reduce biosecurity risks, largely in coordination with U.S. allies through the Australia Group. And export controls have been used historically to control the spread of technical information, software, and computer files, albeit with mixed success.","人工智能模型在未来几年可能构成严重风险。本文以生物安全风险为例，概述了美国出口管制法律的现状、当前应对AI生物安全风险的方式，以及未来如何利用这些法律降低此类风险。我提出两个核心观点：首先，若AI模型实质性协助生物武器研发或部署，模型开发者与部署者依据现行出口管制法规可能面临重大责任；其次，出口管制机构很可能拥有法定权限，可禁止开发者（1）公开前沿模型的权重参数供自由下载，（2）允许模型传播特定类型的危险专业知识。尽管这两项规定可能面临《第一修正案》的重大挑战，但法院很可能支持基于国家安全理由充分论证的精准监管措施。此外，相比主要输出传统表达性内容的大型语言模型（LLMs），法院更可能支持对执行生物技术工作的生成式模型（即生物设计工具BDTs）实施管制。当确需监管AI模型时，美国出口管制制度虽不完美，却是现成的生物安全风险缓释工具。该制度规范美国制造产品的全球流通、美国公民及永久居民的特定行为，以及美国技术信息向外国实体的转移。这些法律具有灵活性，以严厉刑事处罚为后盾，且通常不受《行政程序法》的严格司法审查约束。商务部和国务院拥有充分自主裁量权来实施这些法律。过去数十年间，出口管制通过""澳大利亚集团""与盟国协同，长期用于降低生物安全风险。历史上该制度也曾用于控制技术信息、软件及计算机文件的传播，尽管成效参差不齐。","Biosecurity, artificial intelligence, pandemic, pathogen, generative AI, biological design tools, export control laws, large language models, health law, First Amendment, protein folding models, international law",2024-03-21

Since 2006, the London Protocol has provided a basis in international environmental law to allow carbon dioxide (CO2) storage beneath the seabed when it is safe to do so, and to regulate the injection of CO2 waste streams into sub-seabed geological formations for permanent isolation. However, Article 6 of the London Protocol prohibits the export of waste or other matter for dumping in the marine environment. Therefore in 2019, Contracting Parties to the London Protocol adopted a Resolution to allow provisional application of an amendment to Article 6 of the Protocol to allow export of CO2 for storage in sub-seabed geological formations. This now removed the last significant international legal barrier to carbon capture and storage (CCS), and means that CO2 can be transported across international borders to offshore storage.

Bown,"While the public was transfixed by the Trump administration’s policies alleging that imports were a threat to America’s national security during 2017–20, there was a concomitant and more quiet US policy shift on the export side. Addressing the national security threat presented by exports posed different economic and institutional challenges from those associated with import policy, including the acknowledgment that export controls for legitimate national security reasons can be the first-best policy to confront the problem at its source. Yet, export controls could also be misused as a beggar-thy-neighbor policy to redistribute economic well-being across countries, even from one ally to another. This paper describes how US export control policy evolved over 2017–20, as well as the international institutions — first the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), then the Wassenaar Arrangement — historically tasked with multi-lateralizing US export restrictions used to protect national security. With the potential for US export control policy to brush up more frequently against WTO rules designed to limit the use of export restrictions, the paper also highlights new challenges for the WTO’s system of resolving trade disputes. Overall, a US failure to strike the right balance for its export control policy would result in it being ineffective at addressing national security risks, costly for the economy, and problematic for trade and diplomatic relations.","2017至2020年间，当公众被特朗普政府指控进口威胁美国国家安全的政策所吸引时，美国在出口领域也悄然发生了政策转向。与进口政策不同，应对出口带来的国家安全威胁面临着独特的经济和制度挑战，包括承认出于正当国家安全理由实施出口管制可能是从源头解决问题的首选政策。然而出口管制也可能被滥用为""以邻为壑""的工具，在国家间——甚至盟国之间——重新分配经济利益。本文阐述了2017至2020年美国出口管制政策的演变历程，以及历史上负责将美国用于维护国家安全的出口限制多边化的国际机制——先是多边出口管制协调委员会（COCOM），后转为瓦森纳协定。随着美国出口管制政策可能更频繁地触碰旨在限制出口限制使用的WTO规则，本文还揭示了WTO贸易争端解决机制面临的新挑战。总体而言，若美国无法在出口管制政策上取得恰当平衡，将导致其既无法有效应对国家安全风险，又造成经济代价高昂，还会引发贸易和外交关系问题。","National Security, Export Controls, Dual-Use Technologies, ECRA, Wassenaar Arrangement, Uncertainty",2020-06-16

export control,The Role of Innovation on Thailand's VehicleExportValue,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3186370,Wanta Inta-iad,"The purpose of this report is to study the role of innovation on vehicle export value in Thailand during 2000-2015. The innovation is measured by the number of patents related to the automobile industry. The control variables include inflation rate, interest rate, production number, real effective exchange rate, terms of trade, world GDP growth, and oil price. The study found significant positive impacts of patents granted on Thailand’s vehicle export value implying the impact of innovation to the export value. The findings of this study would be helpful for export policymakers to obtain enhanced levels of economic development and growth of the country. The governments should encourage the development of research and development either at the company level or create and automotive technology institute that all companies could join to develop, share, and increase their technical capability. Moreover, the governments should allow or grant firms a deduction on expenditure (tax deduction) and financial support for internal research and development, innovation, and patents registration.

export control,Are the Benefits ofExportSupport Durable? Evidence from Tunisia,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2359536,Olivier Cadot,"This paper evaluates the effects of the FAMEX export promotion program in Tunisia on the performance of beneficiary firms.  While most studies assess only the short-term impact of such programs, we consider also the longer-term impact.  Estimates suggest that beneficiaries initially saw both faster export growth and greater diversification across destinations and products.  However, three years after the intervention, beneficiaries growth rates and export levels were not significantly different from those of a control group even though they remained more diversified. We confirm that this divergence between export growth and diversification is not due to small export transactions to new markets creating an illusion of diversification; to greater exposure of beneficiary firms to crisis-affected economies leading to stunted export growth; or to spillover benefits for non-beneficiary firms resulting in their catching-up in export sales. We find some evidence that the divergence may be related to constraints within the firm, such as limited experience and in-house export capacity; to external constraints, such as access to finance; and to the design and implementation of the FAMEX program which placed greater emphasis on diversification than on export growth.",本文评估了突尼斯FAMEX出口促进计划对受益企业绩效的影响。与多数仅关注此类计划短期效果的研究不同，我们还考察了其长期影响。评估显示，受益企业最初在出口增速、目标市场及产品多元化方面均有提升。但项目实施三年后，尽管受益企业仍保持更高程度的多元化，其出口增长率与出口水平已与对照组无显著差异。我们证实这种出口增长与多元化的背离并非源于：新市场小额交易造成的多元化假象；受益企业过度依赖受危机影响经济体导致出口增长受阻；或非受益企业通过溢出效应在出口额上实现追赶。研究发现部分证据表明，这种背离可能与企业内部限制（如有限经验与自主出口能力）、外部制约（如融资渠道）以及FAMEX计划更侧重多元化而非出口增长的设计实施有关。,"export margins, Export promotion, firms, impact evaluation, matching grant, propensity-score matching, Tunisia",2013-11-25

Bown,"The Trump administration's allegations that some imports are a threat to America's national security have received wide publicity during 2017-20. But the administration was undertaking a more quiet US policy shift on the export side in the same time frame. Addressing the national security threat presented by exports posed different economic and institutional challenges from those associated with import policy, including the acknowledgment that export controls for legitimate national security reasons can be the first-best policy to confront the problem at its source. Yet, export controls could also be misused as a beggar-thy-neighbor policy to redistribute economic well-being across countries, even from one ally to another. This paper describes how US export control policy evolved over 2017-20, as well as the international institutions - first the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), then the Wassenaar Arrangement -historically tasked with multilateralizing US export restrictions used to protect national security. With the potential for US export control policy to brush up more frequently against WTO rules designed to limit the use of export restrictions, the paper also highlights new challenges for the WTO's system of resolving trade disputes. Overall, a US failure to strike the right balance for its export control policy would result in it being ineffective at addressing national security risks, costly for the economy, and problematic for trade and diplomatic relations.","特朗普政府关于某些进口产品对美国国家安全构成威胁的指控在2017-2020年间广受关注。但同期该政府在出口政策领域正悄然推动美国政策的转向。与进口政策不同，应对出口带来的国家安全威胁面临着独特的经济和制度挑战，包括承认出于正当国家安全理由实施出口管制可能是从源头解决问题的首选政策。然而出口管制也可能被滥用为""以邻为壑""的工具，在国家间——甚至盟国之间——重新分配经济利益。本文阐述了2017-2020年间美国出口管制政策的演变历程，以及历史上负责将美国用于保护国家安全的出口限制多边化的国际机制——先是多边出口管制协调委员会（COCOM），后转为瓦森纳协定。随着美国出口管制政策可能更频繁地触碰旨在限制出口限制使用的WTO规则，本文还着重分析了WTO贸易争端解决机制面临的新挑战。总体而言，若美国无法在出口管制政策上取得恰当平衡，将导致其既无法有效应对国家安全风险，又造成经济代价高昂，还会给贸易和外交关系带来问题。","dual-use technologies, ECRA, export controls, National Security, uncertainty, Wassenaar Arrangement",2020-05-20
export control,An Investigation into China'sExport-Share Policy for Foreign-Invested Firms,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2715200,Andrew Shelley,"This thesis analyses China’s export-share policy; a policy that requires foreign-invested firms to export a certain minimum share of their production.  The initial discussion focuses on the development of China’s foreign investment and foreign exchange control policies since the commencement of the Open Door Policy.  Data on foreign-invested firms is analysed to determine whether (i) the export-share requirements affect investor behaviour, and (ii) the pattern of requirements has changed over time.    The effect of export-share requirements on domestic welfare, foreign investment, and the level of foreign reserves are then examined within a partial equilibrium framework based on Herander and Thomas (1986).  A more extensive general equilibrium analysis is then undertaken within a model that extends and unifies the analyses of Rodrik (1987) and Chao and Yu (1991, 1992, 1994).  Urban unemployment is modelled using the framework of rural-urban migration proposed by Harris and Todaro (1970).  The effect on welfare, foreign investment, and foreign reserves are analysed under both quota and tariff protection for the importable sector. Finally, the results of the theoretical analysis are applied to the earlier discussion on China’s foreign investment and foreign exchange control policies.  It is found that the various policy goals pursued by China have conflicting optimal export-share requirements and, even though many of the theoretical results are ambiguous, the export-share policy implemented by China is likely to be non-optimal.","本论文分析了中国的出口比例政策，该政策要求外商投资企业必须出口其生产的最低特定比例。初始讨论聚焦于自开放政策实施以来中国外资和外汇管制政策的发展。通过分析外商投资企业的数据，旨在确定（i）出口比例要求是否影响投资者行为，以及（ii）这些要求的模式是否随时间发生变化。随后，基于Herander和Thomas（1986）的部分均衡框架，研究了出口比例要求对国内福利、外商投资及外汇储备水平的影响。进一步通过扩展并整合Rodrik（1987）与Chao和Yu（1991, 1992, 1994）的分析模型，进行了更广泛的总体均衡分析，其中采用Harris和Todaro（1970）提出的城乡迁移框架模拟了城市失业现象。研究考察了在进口部门受配额和关税保护两种情形下，政策对福利、外商投资及外汇储备的影响。最后，将理论分析结果应用于先前关于中国外资和外汇管制政策的讨论，发现中国追求的多重政策目标存在相互冲突的最优出口比例要求，且尽管许多理论结论具有不确定性，但中国实施的出口比例政策很可能并非最优。","China, export-share, trade",2016-01-15

China's export processing zones (EPZs) attract foreign companies to set up export processing operations. Chinese firms quickly imitate these companies in both export and import patterns. Exports of the products shipped from EPZs increase throughout the province, with the largest gains in the city containing the EPZ, and the next largest in the cities adjacent to the EPZ. Chinese companies also import the same equipment imported by companies in EPZs, suggesting that they imitate foreign technology. Furthermore, we find that firms that imitate EPZs leapfrog non-imitating firms in productivity.

These controls, which target a broad range of semiconductor manufacturing facilities and AI chips, are part of a strategy aimed at curbing China’s advancement in critical technologies. A notable 32.5% decline in China’s imports of semiconductor manufacturing equipment has been observed, particularly in regions with advanced production capabilities and foreign company operations, such as those involving Samsung Electronics and SK hynix. While Korea experienced substantial drops in exports to China, the Netherlands saw an increase, reflecting its dominance in specific technologies like lithography. The AI chip sector has also been affected, with China turning to downgraded chips due to restricted access to high-performance models from companies like Nvidia. South Korea must adapt by strengthening its upstream semiconductor industry, considering reshoring production, and collaborating with international partners to mitigate risks.

Surprisingly, however, at a time when its competitors are increasing their use of this policy tool, state-backed export credit has become the subject of a hotly contested political battle in the US.  As a result of opposition from the Tea Party, the US Export-Import Bank was forced to halt its lending operations for five months in 2015 and subsequently limited to financing only the smallest transactions.  In this article, I show that the disruption of export credit is undermining the competitiveness of key US industrial sectors and encouraging the movement of advanced, high-value-added manufacturing overseas.  The case of export credit therefore presents an important puzzle:  Why is the US moving in the opposite direction of other states and taking steps that undermine its economic interests?  I argue that the internal US attack on export credit is fueled by the prevailing market fundamentalist ideology that has obscured the role of an active state in fostering the US’s economic success.  This article demonstrates how the rise of a powerful anti-state movement is hindering the ability of the US to conduct effective industrial policy and maintain its economic primacy in the face of growing global competitive pressures.",对大多数主要经济体而言，国家支持的出口信贷是产业政策及促进出口与经济增长战略的核心要素。然而令人惊讶的是，当竞争对手正加大运用这一政策工具时，国家支持的出口信贷却在美国成为激烈政治斗争的焦点。由于茶党势力的反对，美国进出口银行2015年被迫停止贷款业务五个月，随后被限制仅能为最小型交易提供融资。本文论证了出口信贷机制的中断正在削弱美国关键工业领域的竞争力，并推动先进高附加值制造业向海外转移。出口信贷案例由此引出一个重要谜题：为何美国正与其他国家背道而驰，采取损害自身经济利益的举措？笔者认为，美国国内对出口信贷的抨击源于盛行市场的原教旨主义意识形态，这种思潮遮蔽了积极政府在美国经济成功中的历史作用。本文揭示了在全球化竞争压力加剧之际，强势反国家主义运动的兴起如何阻碍美国实施有效产业政策及维持经济霸主地位的能力。,"United States, US, USA, industrial policy, developmental state, Tea Party, Export-Import Bank, Exim, export credit, neoliberalism",2021-01-04

The study is conducted by quantitative research method by using time series econometrics analysis. The study employs an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bound test model to co-integration to investigate the long-run relationship and Error Correction Model (ECM) for the short-run relationship between export and export incentive, real GDP, real exchange rate, gross capital formation, external debt stock, and inflation rate. The long-run empirical result using the bound test reveals that there is a stable long-run relationship between real export and explanatory variables. The study finds out that during the study period the Ethiopian export composition mainly focused on primary product and Europe was the main export destination. In the econometric analysis, the study finds that export incentive has a significant positive impact on export performance both in short-run and long run. Similarly, real GDP and inflation have a significant impact on export performance whereas gross capital formation, real exchange rate and external debt have a significant impact on short-run and long-run during the study period. Further, in the short run, one year lagged values of export and external debt have a positive impact on export performance. The coefficient of equilibrating error term suggests that the speed of adjustment (feedback effects towards the long-run equilibrium) takes a few years for full adjustment when there is a shock in the system.

This study examines the validity of the export-led growth hypothesis of services exports in 5 emerging economies, including Brazil, India, Nigeria, China, and South Africa (BINCS), for the period of 1980-2019. The study employs the panel mean group autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) procedure to identify a causal relationship between services exports and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. The findings show that the export-led growth hypothesis in services only has a positive effect on economic growth in the short run while other variables, including foreign direct investment (FDI), gross capital formation, and labour, increase economic growth in the long run.

This paper investigates the claim that German public export credit guarantees (Hermes guarantees) mitigate this friction to trade flows and hence promote exports. We employ an empirical trade gravity model, where we explicitly control for political risk in the importing country in order to evaluate the effect of export guarantees. The idea behind export promotion through public export credit agencies (ECAs) is that the private market is unable to provide adequate insurance for all risks associated with exports. As a consequence, firms' export activities are limited in the absence of insurance provision. Using a novel data set on guarantees we estimate the effect of guarantees in a static and dynamic panel model. We find a statistically and economically significant positive effect of public export guarantees on exports which indicates that export promotion is indeed effective.

export control,Evaluating the Impact ofExportFinance Support on Firm-LevelExportPerformance: Evidence from Pakistan,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3682019,Fabrice Defever,"This paper evaluates the impact of two export finance support schemes: The Export Finance Scheme (EFS) and the Long-Term Finance Facility for Plant & Machinery (LTFF) on firm-level export performance. These policies offer loans to exporters at concessionary interest rates to finance short-term working capital and long-term investment in machinery and equipment respectively. To do so, we combine customs data with information about which firms participate in each scheme and the value of the loans they obtain between 2015 and 2017. We find that EFS and LTFF increased the growth rate of exports sales by 7 and 8-11 percentage points respectively. Neither policy exerts a significant impact on the number of products that a firm exports or the number of foreign countries it sells to. Our analysis indicates that facilitating long-term investment in physical capital is more cost effective to raise exports than subsidizing exporters’ working capital needs.",本文评估了两种出口融资支持计划——出口融资计划（EFS）和机械设备长期融资机制（LTFF）对企业层面出口表现的影响。这两项政策分别以优惠利率向出口商提供短期营运资金贷款和机械设备长期投资贷款。为此，我们将海关数据与2015至2017年间参与各计划的企业及其所获贷款金额信息相结合。研究发现，EFS和LTFF分别使出口销售额增长率提高了7个百分点和8-11个百分点。两项政策均未对企业出口产品数量或出口目的地国家数量产生显著影响。分析表明，与补贴出口商营运资金需求相比，促进实体资本长期投资对提升出口更具成本效益。,"trade finance, export credit, export subsidies, export margins, Pakistan",2020-08-28

The configuration of the chain, choice of capture technology, transport method and storage site) will vary from case to case. In this study, the CO2is captured in Rotterdam, Netherlands, and transported to an import hub at Kollsnes on the west coast of Norway by shipping. The site from which the CO2is transported from is the export terminal, and encompasses the CO2liquefaction, intermediate storage tank facility, and loading installation. Of these, especially the intermediate storage tank will be area demanding and could pose a challenge in cases where there is limited land area available, or the land purchase cost is high. Three different export terminal configurations have been investigated: onshore, combination of onshore and offshore, and offshore floating terminal. The investigation shows that there is potentially a high degree of flexibility regarding export terminal configuration as all three configurations are feasible. On sites where a fully onshore terminal is not possible other solutions are available. In the case of a fully offshore/near shore terminal parallels can be drawn to the LNG supply chain where floating processing terminals are gaining interest as it is reported to have several attractive advantages including lower cost and construction time.",二氧化碳被捕获后，必须运输至永久封存地点以完成碳捕集与封存链条。该链条的具体配置（包括捕集技术选择、运输方式及封存地点）将因情况而异。本研究以荷兰鹿特丹为二氧化碳捕集地，通过船运将其输送至挪威西海岸科尔斯尼斯的接收枢纽。二氧化碳运输起点为出口终端，涵盖液化装置、中间储罐设施及装载系统。其中中间储罐尤其需要占用大面积场地，在可用土地有限或购地成本高昂的情况下可能构成挑战。研究考察了三种不同的出口终端配置方案：全陆上终端、陆海混合终端以及海上浮动终端。研究表明出口终端配置具有高度灵活性，三种方案均具可行性。在无法建设全陆上终端的场地，可采用其他替代方案。对于全离岸/近岸终端方案，可参照液化天然气供应链中日益受关注的浮动处理终端模式，据报道该模式具有成本更低、建造周期更短等多项显著优势。,"CO2 liquefaction, CO2 intermediate storage, CO2 export terminal",2021-03-24

First, I use transition probability matrices for comparing how countries move across the world distribution for different time periods. I find that transitions toward high export ratios have been mainly experienced by Asian countries, but also some reformers like Mexico and Chile have been able to increase their exports significantly. Countries making transitions toward low export ratios are mainly from Africa, but these countries only constitute a half of economies with bad export performance. I focus then on which structural factors may be important for long-run transitions. The results suggest that more open economies and those with better institutions are more likely to move to high export ratios in the long-run. Finally, I explore within-country experiences for identifying episodes of export transitions. Using an event study methodology, I find a very weak association between export transitions and economic growth and investment rate. In contrast, my results suggest that transitions are potentially driven by improvements in financial development. Finally, favorable terms of trade, increments in productivity, and reductions in exchange rate distortions are not found to be a catalyst for export transitions.",本文采用广泛的多国数据集，分析了不同时期出口导向的差异化表现。首先，我运用转移概率矩阵比较各国在不同时段全球分布中的位次变化，发现亚洲国家是出口比率提升的主要群体，但墨西哥、智利等改革国家也实现了出口显著增长。出口比率下降的国家主要来自非洲，但这些国家仅占出口表现不佳经济体的一半。随后我重点研究了影响长期转型的结构性因素，结果表明经济开放度更高、制度更完善的国家更可能实现出口比率长期提升。最后通过国内案例分析识别出口转型阶段，运用事件研究法发现出口转型与经济增长率、投资率的关联性极弱。相反，研究显示金融发展水平的提升可能是驱动转型的关键因素。而有利的贸易条件、生产率提高及汇率扭曲减少等因素，均未显现出对出口转型的催化作用。,"export performance, transition, institutions, trade policy",2007-05-20

By contrast, what has remained largely neglected is a detailed investigation in the service sector. As aggregate statistics show, international trade in services has grown significantly over the last few years. However, it is unclear why some companies export and others do not. This paper presents some initial results about the German business services sector at firm level. Using a unique panel dataset of enterprises from the business services sector (transport, storage and communication, real estate, renting and business activities) for the years 2003 to 2005, we analysed the impact of several firm-specific characteristics such as size, productivity, human capital, experience on the national market in Germany, etc. on the firms' export performance. Further, we used the pooled fractional probit estimator, recently introduced by Papke & Wooldridge, an approach that considers both the special nature of the export intensity variable and in addition unobserved time-invariant characteristics. When there is no control for fixed enterprise effects the overall results are in line with previous studies. When there is a control for unobserved heterogeneity, the positive effects of productivity and human capital disappear, indicating that these variables are not per se positively related to export performance, but rather to time-constant characteristics that are unobserved.

export control,Complying withExportLaws without Importing Discrimination Liability: An Attempt to Integrate Employment Discrimination Laws and the DeemedExportRules,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1018760,Sandra Sperino,"The federal deemed export rules prohibit certain individuals from receiving any information about certain technologies without the required license, even if those individuals are otherwise authorized to work within the United States.  In other words, employers who deal with technology or software subject to export control may be considered to be illegally exporting such technology or software, simply by allowing certain foreign nationals to work with or gain information about the restricted items. This article will attempt two moderately simple tasks and one more difficult.  The first task is to identify the tensions that exist between the deemed export rules and the federal anti-discrimination statutes, creating awareness about potential issues that might arise if employers use general human resources advice, while neglecting deemed export requirements. Second, the article will attempt to demonstrate how employers who want to become involved in the complex deemed export regime can do so, consistent with the federal anti-discrimination statutes.  While concern exists that employers complying with the deemed export rules may be placing themselves in violation of Title VII and IRCA, this article argues that, in most cases, employment screenings for deemed export requirements should not yield liability under either Title VII or IRCA. The third task is more complex.  To comply with deemed export law, an employer must obtain an employee-specific export license prior to making the restricted technology available to the foreign national.  The required licenses often take months to obtain, and, it may be difficult or impossible for employers to obtain such licenses for certain employees.  To comply with the deemed export requirements in a hiring or promotion context, the employer would be required to limit an employee's job responsibilities to non-export controlled work or to place the foreign national employee on unpaid leave until the government made its decision on whether to issue the license.  This places the employer in the position of leaving certain tasks unperformed or requiring other employees to take on additional job responsibilities during the interim, causing project delays. Once an employer becomes involved in the deemed export regime, it has responsibilities to ensure that the employee's access to technology remains within the granted license and that all of the conditions of the license continue to be met.  This article argues that, consistent with the federal anti-discrimination statutes, employers should be able, in certain instances, to choose not to hire, assign, or promote certain foreign nationals, simply because to do so would trigger the employer's involvement in the legally perilous, complex, and uncertain deemed export regime.  Additionally, the article argues that employers should be allowed to engage in a cost-benefit analysis regarding whether the value added by particular job positions merits involvement with the deemed export regime. To be clear, this article does not advocate that all employers begin to consider national origin or country of citizenship when hiring.  Nor does it advocate that an employer should be able to use the deemed export rules as a pretext for discrimination based on national origin or citizenship.  Rather, the article demonstrates that neither Title VII nor IRCA prohibit an employer from refusing to hire an individual, if the reason for that decision is a desire to avoid becoming involved in the deemed export regime.",联邦推定出口规则禁止某些个人在未获得必要许可证的情况下接收特定技术的任何信息，即使这些个人已获准在美国工作。换言之，处理受出口管制技术或软件的雇主若允许某些外籍人士接触或获取受限物品的相关信息，可能被视为非法出口此类技术或软件。本文试图完成两项相对简单的任务和一项更复杂的任务。首要任务是揭示推定出口规则与联邦反歧视法规之间的张力，警示雇主若仅遵循通用人力资源建议而忽视推定出口要求可能引发的潜在问题。其次，本文试图论证有意参与复杂推定出口机制的雇主如何在遵守联邦反歧视法规的前提下实现合规。尽管存在对合规行为可能违反《民权法案第七章》和《移民改革与控制法案》的担忧，但本文主张在多数情况下，基于推定出口要求进行的雇佣筛查不应导致这两项法案下的法律责任。第三项任务更为复杂。为遵守推定出口法律，雇主必须在外籍员工接触受限技术前获取针对该员工的出口许可证。此类许可证通常需数月才能获批，且某些员工的许可证可能难以或无法取得。在雇佣或晋升场景中，为满足推定出口要求，雇主需将员工职责限制在非出口管制工作范围内，或令外籍员工在政府作出许可证审批决定前处于无薪休假状态。这将导致雇主面临特定任务无人执行或需其他员工临时承担额外职责的困境，造成项目延误。一旦雇主涉足推定出口机制，便有责任确保员工对技术的接触始终不超出许可证授权范围，并持续满足所有许可条件。本文主张，在符合联邦反歧视法规的前提下，雇主应有权在某些情况下仅因可能涉足法律风险高、复杂且不确定的推定出口机制，就决定不雇佣、不分配或不晋升特定外籍人士。此外，本文认为应允许雇主进行成本效益分析，评估特定岗位的附加值是否值得涉足推定出口机制。需要明确的是，本文并非主张所有雇主在招聘时开始考虑国籍或公民身份因素，也不支持雇主以推定出口规则为借口实施基于国籍或公民身份的歧视。相反，本文论证当决策动机是避免涉足推定出口机制时，《民权法案第七章》和《移民改革与控制法案》均不禁止雇主拒绝雇佣某个人。,"deemed export, Title VII, IRCA",2007-10-03

export control,Learning toExportfrom Neighbors,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2425106,Ana Fernandes,"This paper studies how learning from neighboring firms affects new exporters’ performance and dynamics. We develop a statistical decision model in which a firm updates its prior belief about demand of a foreign market based on the number of neighbors currently selling there, the level and heterogeneity of their export sales, and the firm’s own prior knowledge about the market. A positive signal about demand inferred from neighbors’ export performance raises the firm’s probability of entry and initial sales in the market, but lowers post-entry growth, conditional on survival. These learning effects are stronger when there are more neighbors revealing the signal or when the firm is less familiar with the market. Decisions to exit are independent of the prevalence of neighboring export activities. We find supporting evidence from the transaction-level export data for all Chinese exporters over 2000-2006. Our findings are robust to controlling for firms’ supply shocks, countries’ demand shocks, and city-country fixed effects.",本文研究了从邻近企业学习如何影响新出口商的绩效与动态变化。我们构建了一个统计决策模型，企业根据当前在该市场销售的邻近企业数量、其出口销售额水平与差异性，以及企业自身对该市场的先验认知，来更新其对国外市场需求的先验判断。从邻近企业出口表现推断出的积极需求信号会提高企业进入该市场的概率和初始销售额，但会降低存活企业的后续增长。当传递信号的邻近企业数量更多，或企业对市场熟悉度较低时，这种学习效应更为显著。退出决策与邻近出口活动的普遍性无关。我们利用2000-2006年间中国所有出口企业的交易级数据找到了支持性证据。研究结果在控制企业供给冲击、国家需求冲击及城市-国家固定效应后依然稳健。,"learning to export, knowledge spillover, uncertainty, export dynamics",2014-04-16

Empirical results suggest that OECD countries issuing trade credits with generous state-guarantees did not, during the 1999 to 2005 period, witness more exports towards politically and commercially more unstable low income countries. Rather, publicly indemnified trade finance has promoted exports, to a modest degree, towards high and middle-income countries, where financial intermediaries and markets provide viable alternatives to hedge against payment risks.",本文旨在探究公共出口保险计划在多大程度上促进了国际贸易。为此，研究推导出一个引力方程，用于衡量企业遭遇外国买家违约时面临的财务损失风险。实证结果表明，在1999至2005年期间，提供国家高额担保贸易信贷的经合组织成员国，并未显著增加对政治和商业环境更不稳定的低收入国家的出口。相反，获得公共补偿的贸易融资在一定程度上促进了向高收入和中高收入国家的出口——这些国家的金融中介和市场本身已具备对冲付款风险的可行替代方案。,"Export Credit Insurance, Export Promotion, Default Risk, Gravity Equation",2007-12-03
export control,How Rising Powers Create Governance Gaps: The Case ofExportCredit and the Environment,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3758569,Kristen Hopewell,"How are rising powers affecting global governance?  This article analyzes their impact on an important but understudied area of global governance at the intersection of trade and environment:  export credit.  State-backed export credit agencies (ECAs) play a major role in financing large infrastructure and energy projects, particularly in developing countries.  Many of these projects carry significant environmental implications, yet there has been little scholarly attention to their governance.  Since the 1990s, global governance of the environmental practices of ECAs has been progressively expanded and strengthened via the OECD Arrangement on export credit and Common Approaches for environmental and social due diligence.  Recently, however, there has been a dramatic increase in export credit provision by rising powers, such as India and China, who are not members of the OECD nor subject to the Arrangement or Common Approaches.  In this article, I argue that existing governance mechanisms have not caught up with the rapidly changing landscape of export credit.  Drawing on the case of India’s financing for the Rampal coal-fired power plant in Bangladesh, I show that the problem of environmental governance for export credit increasingly extends beyond the advanced-industrialized states of the OECD.  In a context where nearly half of all export credit is now provided by countries outside the OECD, I argue, existing governance mechanisms are no longer sufficient.  The failure to cover the large and growing volume of export credit provided by the emerging powers represents a major gap in the established system of environmental governance for export credit.",新兴大国如何影响全球治理？本文分析它们对一个重要但研究不足的全球治理领域——贸易与环境交叉领域的出口信贷——所产生的影响。国家支持的出口信贷机构（ECAs）在为大型基础设施和能源项目提供融资方面发挥着重要作用，尤其是在发展中国家。这些项目中许多都具有重大的环境影响，然而对其治理的学术关注却很少。自20世纪90年代以来，通过经合组织（OECD）的出口信贷安排及环境和社会尽职调查共同方法，对ECA环境实践的全球治理逐步扩大和加强。然而最近，印度和中国等新兴大国提供的出口信贷急剧增加，它们不是OECD成员，也不受该安排或共同方法的约束。在本文中，我认为现有的治理机制未能跟上出口信贷格局的快速变化。以印度为孟加拉国拉姆帕尔燃煤电厂提供融资的案例为例，我表明出口信贷环境治理问题日益超出OECD先进工业化国家的范围。在如今近半数出口信贷由非OECD国家提供的背景下，我认为现有治理机制已不再足够。未能涵盖新兴大国提供的大量且不断增长的出口信贷，是现有出口信贷环境治理体系中的一个重大缺口。,"export credit, global environmental governance, global economic governance, global governance, rising powers, India, OECD Arrangement, coal, power plant",2021-01-04

However, due to financial constraints, SMEs in Cameroon do face significant challenges to exporting, which affect their export performance. Many SMEs develop relationships with financial institutions to benefit from loans to overcome export barriers. However, there is no evidence as to whether such benefits help them overcome the limitations of their financial constraints to improve their export performance. Using data from the World Bank Enterprise Survey 2016 in Cameroon, we examine the moderation effect of loans as a benefit of networks on the relationship between financial constraints and export performance for SMEs in Cameroon using regression analysis. Our results show that financial constraints negatively affect export performance. The moderation effect was significant but negative which means the benefit of network (loans) was not enough to offset the negative effect of financial constraints on export performance. Studies on export barriers and export performance for SMEs in Cameroon are scarce and our research provides some policy and managerial implications to help SME exporting in Cameroon.",中小企业的表现是经济发展的重要决定因素，尤其是在喀麦隆等发展中国家。然而，由于财务限制，喀麦隆的中小企业在出口方面确实面临重大挑战，这影响了它们的出口表现。许多中小企业与金融机构建立关系，以获得贷款来克服出口障碍。然而，目前尚无证据表明这些贷款是否有助于它们克服财务限制，从而改善出口表现。我们利用2016年喀麦隆世界银行企业调查的数据，通过回归分析研究了贷款作为网络利益对喀麦隆中小企业财务约束与出口表现之间关系的调节作用。我们的研究结果表明，财务约束对出口表现有负面影响。调节作用显著但为负，这意味着网络利益（贷款）不足以抵消财务约束对出口表现的负面影响。关于喀麦隆中小企业出口障碍和出口表现的研究较少，我们的研究为帮助喀麦隆中小企业出口提供了一些政策和管理方面的启示。,"Export barriers, Lack of finance, Network, Export performance, and Cameroon",2022-11-30

In this paper we build on this work and examine the heterogeneity in returns across countries to disentangle which are the characteristics of Trade Promotion Organizations (TPOs) that are more likely to generate higher returns. Results suggest that on average a one percent increase in export promotion budgets increases exports by 0.074 percent, confirming results in the earlier literature. Our results also suggest that these export gains translate into very large GDP per capita gains. Indeed, a one percent increase in export budgets generates a 0.065 percent increase in GDP per capita.

About 45 aromatic rice farms were selected from five villages of Dinajpur district using stratified sampling method for the study. Data were analyzed with a combination of descriptive statistics, mathematical and statistical techniques. Cobb-Douglas production function represented that three out of seven independent variables had significant impact on gross return from aromatic rice production. The significant variables were education, power tiller cost and fertilizer cost. Domestic Resource Cost (DRC) analysis showed that Bangladesh had comparative advantage in aromatic rice production both from the view point of export and import substitution, as DRC was 0.51 and 0.64 for import and export parity prices, respectively. The study suggests that price of fertilizer, seeds and other inputs should be maintained and marketing and trade related costs and barriers should be minimized to amplify the potential of aromatic rice production in Bangladesh.",本研究旨在评估孟加拉国香米的出口潜力，并识别影响香米生产总收益的因素。研究采用分层抽样法，从迪纳杰布尔地区的五个村庄选取了约45个香米种植农场。通过结合描述性统计、数学及统计技术对数据进行分析。柯布-道格拉斯生产函数显示，七个自变量中有三个对香米生产总收益具有显著影响，分别为教育水平、动力耕作机成本和肥料成本。国内资源成本（DRC）分析表明，从出口和进口替代的角度来看，孟加拉国在香米生产上均具有比较优势，其进口平价和出口平价的DRC值分别为0.51和0.64。研究建议应稳定肥料、种子及其他投入品的价格，同时降低营销和贸易相关成本与壁垒，以提升孟加拉国香米生产的潜力。,"Aromatic Rice, Production, Export, Comparative Advantage, Bangladesh",2021-01-30
export control,The Impact ofExportRestraints on Rising Grain Prices,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1268958,Kendall Dollive,"Commodity prices in maize and wheat have risen by more than 50 percent since 2006. While much of this increase reflects increasing demand and some constraints on supply, another factor contributing to the rising prices is the export restraints implemented by major grain exporting countries, such as China, Ukraine, and Argentina. While these measures are intended to keep domestic prices low, they tighten global supply and put upward pressure on prices for importers. This report presents quantitative evidence of the impact of export restrictions on the global agricultural market by evaluating these recent cases of export restraints using available monthly and annual trade data. When an exporting country enacts restrictive measures, their importing partners must often purchase grain from other exporters, causing more intense competition for the remaining available supplies. The impact of export restraints in these cases suggests that governments should use them cautiously.",自2006年以来，玉米和小麦等大宗商品价格已上涨超过50%。虽然这一增长主要反映了需求增加和部分供应限制，但另一个推高价格的因素是中国、乌克兰和阿根廷等主要粮食出口国实施的出口限制措施。尽管这些措施旨在保持国内低价，但它们却导致全球供应趋紧，并给进口国的价格带来上行压力。本报告通过利用现有的月度及年度贸易数据评估近期出口限制案例，量化呈现了出口限制对全球农产品市场的影响。当出口国实施限制措施时，其进口伙伴往往不得不从其他出口国购买粮食，从而加剧对剩余可用供应的竞争。这些案例中出口限制的影响表明，各国政府应谨慎使用此类措施。,"grain, prices, export restraints, export ban, export quota, trade",2008-09-18

Specifically, we argue that EEFs will be more likely to export when facing more uncertainty at home from greater political instability, substantial informal competition, and high corruption. Furthermore, we hypothesize that firms’ export intensities will be contingent upon specialized internal capabilities such as a skilled workforce, top managerial experience, and access to external technologies. We test these hypotheses using a dataset of more than 16,000 firms from the four BRIC economies (i.e., Brazil, Russia, China and India). Our results confirm that political instability and informal competition have robust effects on the export propensity of EEFs, whilst export intensity is contingent upon the availability of skilled workers and access to external technologies via licensing.","我们提出一个两阶段理论模型，认为新兴经济体企业（EEFs）的出口表现既取决于其企业特定能力，也受母国制度环境影响。具体而言，我们认为当母国因政治不稳定、非正规竞争激烈和腐败严重而存在更高不确定性时，EEFs更可能选择出口。此外，我们假设企业出口强度将取决于专业化内部能力，如熟练劳动力、高层管理经验及外部技术获取。我们使用来自金砖四国（即巴西、俄罗斯、中国和印度）超过16,000家企业的数据集验证这些假设。研究结果证实，政治不稳定和非正规竞争对EEFs出口倾向具有显著影响，而出口强度则取决于熟练工人的可获得性及通过许可获取外部技术的能力。",Emerging economy firms; Export performance; Firm capabilities;  Institutions; Heckman selection,2017-07-24

Deploying and Heckman selection process we modelled the two decisions of whether to export or not, and how much to export, separately.  The results indicate that the decision to start exporting is positively associated with the presence of foreign firms in the same industry and region;  furthermore export oriented foreign affiliates seem to be the source of stronger export spillovers.

An Analysis on China’sExportTax andExportVAT Refund Rebate Policies,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1737945,Xin Wang,"Export VAT refund rebate and export tax (EVRRET) measures have been adopted on energy intensive products in recent years in China. They are proclaimed to be climate policy, yet there is no explicit and unique carbon cost set on export - the implicit export carbon tax rates vary dramatically across sectors and over different periods. This paper provides a method of introducing an explicit and unique carbon cost into the current EVRRET. By setting a comparable carbon cost (2'9/tCO2 and 3'9/tCO2) for eight major energy-intensive sectors to which the EVRRET are massively applied, it derives the corresponding ad valorem average rate for each sector. This paper finds that the introduction of a carbon cost into export VAT refund rebate policy would not increase the current export VAT refund rebate rate (except for the chemical sector), but would simply define a ceiling, while the same introduction into the export tax policy would lead to an overall increase in sectoral export tax rates. This paper concludes by examining competitiveness and WTO concerns, suggesting that the better option for introducing a carbon cost into Chinese exports would be through reforming export VAT refund rebate policy.",近年来，中国对高耗能产品采取了出口增值税退税与出口税（EVRRET）措施。这些措施虽被宣称为气候政策，但并未对出口设定明确统一的碳成本——不同行业和时期的隐含出口碳税率差异显著。本文提出一种方法，将明确统一的碳成本引入现行EVRRET体系。通过为EVRRET广泛适用的八大高耗能行业设定可比碳成本（2'9美元/吨CO2和3'9美元/吨CO2），推算出各行业相应的从价平均税率。研究发现：在出口增值税退税政策中引入碳成本不会提高现行退税率（化工行业除外），仅会形成税率上限；而将其引入出口税政策则会导致行业出口税率普遍上升。最后本文通过评估竞争力与WTO合规性问题，指出改革出口增值税退税政策是中国出口领域引入碳成本的更优选择。,"carbon tax, export tax, export VAT refund rebate, climate change, China",2011-01-11

Given the evidence of fast unconditional convergence in export quality, this raises the question how to reconcile these stylized facts with a stable world income distribution.This paper is the first to document why cross-country export quality convergence within products does not entail aggregate export quality convergence across countries. In fact, the latter is absent because the country-product-specific residual after accounting for export quality convergence is biased in favor of high-income countries’ exports. To document this pattern of export quality dynamics and assess its aggregate implications, we construct bilateral export quality estimates for 122 countries and 2,700 manufacturing goods.Furthermore, we show that the key explanation for this country-product-specific ‘quality innovation residual’ is the fact that high-income countries are more capital abundant and financially developed and export goods that are better aligned to their human capital endowments, all of which are correlated with export quality innovation.","先前的研究已证实，国家收入水平与其出口商品质量之间存在显著相关性。鉴于出口质量呈现快速无条件趋同的证据，这引发了一个问题：如何将这些典型事实与稳定的世界收入分配相协调？本文首次揭示了为何产品内部的跨国出口质量趋同并未导致国家间整体出口质量的趋同。事实上，后者之所以缺失，是因为在考虑出口质量趋同后，特定国家-产品层面的残差偏向于高收入国家的出口。为记录这种出口质量动态模式并评估其总体影响，我们构建了122个国家和2700种制造业产品的双边出口质量估算值。此外，我们发现这种特定国家-产品层面的""质量创新残差""关键成因在于：高收入国家资本更充裕、金融体系更发达，且其出口商品与人力资本禀赋更匹配——这些因素均与出口质量创新密切相关。","export quality, convergence, export upgrading, quality ladders",2021-11-02

export control,Exporting Waste: Regulation of theExportof Hazardous Wastes from the United States,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1955212,Jeffrey M. Gaba,"The international trade in hazardous wastes has been a subject of controversy for decades.   Notorious examples of hazardous wastes being improperly disposed of in Africa have created concern about the legitimacy of developed western countries “dumping” the hazardous byproducts of their industrial development on less-developed countries. This article examines the legal bases for EPA’s regulation of the exports of hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. It contains a detailed examination of EPA’s complex sets of export regulations and provides data on the actual scope of exports reported to EPA.  It examines a series of questions regarding EPA’s authority to regulate the export of hazardous wastes: what domestic authority does EPA derive from the international agreements; what is the scope of EPA’s authority to exclude hazardous wastes from export control; what authority does EPA have to ban the export of hazardous wastes to countries with whom we do not have an international agreement and which may not manage the waste properly?  The article also examines the extent to which EPA regulations address the significant concerns associated with the largely unregulated export of electronic wastes. The article reaches a number of perhaps surprising conclusions.  First, the article suggests that provisions of RCRA that purport to give domestic legal effect to future international agreements would violate constitutional procedures required to implement actions with legislative effect.  It also analyzes case law that suggests that conferring binding authority on a Decision of the OECD would constitute an unconstitutional delegation of authority to an international entity. Second, the article questions the legal basis of the U.S. decision not to ratify the Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste.  Although the U.S. has signed and the Senate has consented to ratification, the U.S. has not formally ratified the Convention based on the position of the Department of State and EPA that Basel cannot be implemented without statutory changes to RCRA. This article suggests that RCRA currently contains adequate authority to implement Basel and thus ratification could be immediately undertaken.  The article argues, however, that control of the international trade in U.S. hazardous waste may be better served by the U.S. not ratifying Basel. Third, there may be a substantial misperception, fostered by EPA, about the regulation of electronic wastes under RCRA.  EPA has suggested that only waste “cathode ray tubes” are a hazardous waste under RCRA, but EPA’s own data suggest that a substantial amount of other e-wastes should be classified as hazardous wastes and thus subject to export controls. Perhaps the most significant step EPA could take to strengthen its existing export regulations would be to clarify the status of such e-wastes. Fourth, EPA does have the authority under RCRA to impose export controls on hazardous wastes that it has excluded from domestic regulation.  Thus, EPA could regulate the export of e-wastes while not imposing requirements on the domestic recycling of such wastes.   Finally, EPA’s management of the export of hazardous waste would be improved by providing more transparency through online posting of export data.

export control,Political Risk andExportPromotion: Evidence from Germany,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=944779,Christoph Moser,"Political risk represents an important hidden transaction cost that reduces international trade. This paper investigates the claim that German public export credit guarantees (Hermes guarantees) mitigate this friction to trade flows and hence promote exports. We employ an empirical trade gravity model, where we explicitly control for political risk in the importing country in order to evaluate the effect of export guarantees. The idea behind export promotion through public export credit agencies (ECAs) is that the private market is unable to provide adequate insurance for all risks associated with exports. As a consequence, firms' export activities are limited in the absence of insurance provision. Using a novel data set on guarantees we estimate the effect of guarantees in a static and dynamic panel model. We find a statistically and economically significant positive effect of public export guarantees on exports which indicates that export promotion is indeed effective. Furthermore, political risk turns out to be a robust determinant of exports and hence should be taken into account in any empirical model of trade.",政治风险是降低国际贸易的一项重要隐性交易成本。本文研究了德国公共出口信用担保（赫尔墨斯担保）能否缓解贸易流动中的这一摩擦从而促进出口的主张。我们采用实证贸易引力模型，通过明确控制进口国的政治风险来评估出口担保的效果。通过公共出口信用机构（ECAs）促进出口的理念在于，私营市场无法为出口相关的所有风险提供充分保险。因此，在缺乏保险保障的情况下，企业的出口活动会受到限制。利用新构建的担保数据集，我们在静态和动态面板模型中估算了担保的效果。研究发现公共出口担保对出口具有统计显著且经济意义重大的正向影响，表明出口促进政策确实有效。此外，政治风险被证实是出口的稳健决定因素，因此任何贸易实证模型都应将其纳入考量。,"public export credit guarantees, political risk, panel regression",2006-11-14
export control,BringingExportPerformance Metrics into Annual Reports: The Perfex Scorecard,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=882472,Luis Filipe Lages,"At a time when exporting activity is becoming a major resource for creating firms' value and national economic wealth, it is surprising that annual company reports rarely distinguish between domestic market performance and the performance of export markets' operations. Even more rarely do annual reports provide information on annual indicators of specific export ventures performance. Shareholders might assume that if executives choose not to disclose export information in annual reports their exporting activity is not relevant or not successful. Trying to overcome this state of affairs, the authors develop and test a new measure for assessing the Annual Performance of an Export Venture (the APEV scale). The new measure comprises five dimensions: 1) annual export venture's financial performance; 2) annual export venture's strategic performance; 3) annual export venture's achievement; 4) contribution of the export venture to annual exporting operations; and 5) satisfaction with annual export venture's overall performance. In addition, the APEV scale is used to generate a scorecard of PERFormance in EXporting (the PERFEX scorecard) to be included in annual reports. The PERFEX scorecard allows the assessment of export performance at the corporate level while comparatively evaluating all export ventures of the firm. Both the scale and the scorecard are expected to help disclose export (ventures') performance and are provided as useful instruments for annual planning, management, monitoring, and improvement of exporting programs.",在出口活动日益成为创造企业价值和国民经济财富主要来源的当下，令人惊讶的是企业年报很少区分国内市场表现与出口市场运营表现。年报更少提供具体出口项目年度绩效指标的信息。股东们可能会认为，如果管理层选择不在年报中披露出口信息，说明其出口活动无关紧要或并不成功。为改变这一现状，作者开发并测试了一种评估出口项目年度绩效的新指标（APEV量表）。该指标包含五个维度：1）出口项目年度财务绩效；2）出口项目年度战略绩效；3）出口项目年度成果；4）出口项目对年度出口业务的贡献；5）对出口项目年度整体表现的满意度。此外，APEV量表还用于生成出口绩效记分卡（PERFEX记分卡）并纳入年报。PERFEX记分卡可在企业层面评估出口绩效，同时横向比较公司所有出口项目。该量表和记分卡都有助于披露出口（项目）绩效，是出口项目年度规划、管理、监控和改进的有效工具。,"Export Performance, Export Marketing, APEV, PERFEX, EXPERF, Scorecard",2006-02-22

Margulis,"Food security emerged as a major source of political deadlock in the WTO Doha Round negotiations. Concerns about food security only intensified at the WTO following the 2008 Global Food Crisis, with the Bali and Nairobi Ministerials revealing polarized views between the US and India on the financing of public food stockholding. These “food fights” at the WTO have attracted significant international media, civil society and scholarly attention. In this article, I argue that inter-state disagreement on food security is not new or specific to the Doha Round but instead has been a recurrent phenomenon in the multilateral trade system for decades. Employing an historical approach, I show that food security has repeatedly been an item of negotiation in successive GATT negotiating rounds and has been steadily codified in international trade law over time. Today, food security is deeply integrated into the rules of the trade regime, making the WTO an important yet largely unacknowledged institution in global food security governance.","粮食安全成为世贸组织多哈回合谈判中政治僵局的主要根源。2008年全球粮食危机后，世贸组织内部对粮食安全的担忧进一步加剧，巴厘和内罗毕部长级会议暴露出美国与印度在公共粮食储备融资问题上的尖锐对立。这些世贸组织框架下的""粮食之争""引发了国际媒体、民间团体和学术界的广泛关注。本文认为，国家间在粮食安全问题上的分歧并非多哈回合独有，而是数十年来多边贸易体系中反复出现的现象。通过历史研究视角，本文论证粮食安全历来是关贸总协定历轮谈判的议题，并逐渐被纳入国际贸易法体系。如今，粮食安全已深度融入贸易体制规则，使世贸组织成为全球粮食安全治理中重要却未获充分认知的机构。","WTO, GATT, Food Security, Trade Negotiations",2018-03-07

Relations between the European Union and China have also experienced their fair share of troubles, with different Member States split on whether and to what degree they wish to confront China. Although the causes of this chilling in economic and political relations between China and many of its largest trading partners are complex, one area where we are seeing this play out most acutely is in the area of techno-nationalism, with more and more countries enacting broad-based trade and investment restrictions against Chinese technology companies and justifying these actions by invoking national security.This working paper explores the linkages between the areas of trade, technology and security which have become so prevalent over the last half-decade. In doing so, it addresses these issues by focusing on three core research questions, namely:1. What activities do technology firms pursue on foreign markets and how do restrictions imposed by governments for national security reasons circumscribe either these firms’ market access or freedom of action in a way that prejudices their relative competitive position on these markets?2. What obligations are incumbent upon governments by virtue of international trade and investment treaty commitments to permit the entry and operation on their domestic markets of foreign technology firms and to what extent do national security exceptions as formulated in these same treaties allow governments to set aside these obligations?3. What are some solutions to balancing the need for an open and non-discriminatory trading system with the imperative of upholding national security where these policy priorities collide in the area of trade and technology, and what role do different actors (States, firms, others) have to play?","随着中美紧张关系加剧，中国与其他许多国家的经济政治摩擦也日益增多，尤其是""五眼联盟""情报共享机制成员国（可能除新西兰外）。欧盟与中国的关系同样遭遇诸多波折，各成员国在是否及如何应对中国的问题上立场分化。尽管中国与多个主要贸易伙伴间经贸政治关系遇冷的原因错综复杂，但技术民族主义领域表现得尤为突出——越来越多国家正对华实施全面技术贸易投资限制，并以国家安全为由为其行为辩护。本工作文件旨在探究过去五年间日益凸显的贸易、技术与安全三大领域的联动关系，通过三个核心研究问题展开分析：1. 科技企业在海外市场开展哪些业务？政府以国家安全为由实施的限制措施如何通过市场准入或经营自由度的约束，削弱这些企业在相关市场的相对竞争优势？2. 根据国际贸易投资条约承诺，政府在允许外资科技企业进入和运营方面承担哪些义务？这些条约中的国家安全例外条款在多大程度上允许政府豁免这些义务？3. 当开放非歧视贸易体系需求与国家安全诉求在贸易技术领域产生冲突时，如何实现平衡？不同主体（国家、企业及其他方）应分别发挥何种作用？","International Trade Policy, Technological Innovation, National Security",2022-11-02

Methods of correlation and regression analysis were used to study the strength of the relationship between the volume of turnover and the factors that determine it.Based on the modeling, a statistically significant relationship was identified between the indicators of the volume of information and related services and trade volumes, which confirms the dependence of the economic security of trade enterprises on digitalization.

In the early years of the independences, these countries have adopted a development model based on commodity production for export to industrialized economies. Foreign exchange from its exports should allow them to import the food products, while investing in food sector and in the others sectors needed for their development. Based on the instrumental variables method that corrects the problems of endogeneity and omitted variables, the result shows that external trade has a negative effect on food security in these countries. In fact, it has a negative impact on food production and household consumption. It also has a positive effect on the consumer price index. In addition, it does not lead to food imports. Thus, these results run counter of those of the existing literature based on the empirical studies in other developing countries that have found that foreign trade increased food security. In this context, the contribution of the study consists to providing a fresh look at the effect of foreign trade on food security. In fact, the results lead to not generalize the conclusions of the existing literature, notably in the countries of the sample.

Conversely, when these factors shifted in the opposing directions, the likelihood of trade conflict escalation decreased. This chapter devotes particular attention to the role of trade-security linkages in the trade war. Shared security interests were strengthened by positive substantive linkages between trade and Cold War aims; however, interests diverged when negative substantive linkages emerged between Japanese products and US defense capabilities and when tactical linkages were used to force concessions.",本章追溯了20世纪60年代末至90年代中期美日贸易战的演变过程，这场贸易战从进出口领域逐渐扩展到更广泛的宏观经济、结构性和技术性问题。基于分析，本章指出当美日之间相对经济实力的感知差距缩小、共同安全利益和对自由贸易规范的支持减弱、且相关争端解决机制范围狭窄时，贸易冲突升级的可能性就会增加；反之，当这些因素向相反方向发展时，贸易冲突升级的可能性则会降低。本章特别关注了贸易与安全关联在贸易战中的作用：当贸易与冷战目标之间形成积极的实质性关联时，共同安全利益得到加强；但当日本产品与美国国防能力之间出现消极实质性关联，以及当战术性关联被用于迫使对方让步时，双方利益就会出现分歧。,"trade war, US-Japan relations, issue linkage, security, trade dispute, economic-security linkages",2021-05-04

While members make (somewhat) use of existing WTO institutions and procedures, the exceptionalism and secrecy of security hinder information sharing and peer review of security-rooted trade practices. This article provides a descriptive analysis and prescriptions for WTO institutional techniques for addressing members’ security-related measures daily – that is, on a routine basis, via trade policy review and WTO notification processes. It shows that the trade community already possess the tools to manage the growing issue-area of trade and security. The unanswered question is whether WTO members see value in discussing security at the WTO.",不可预测的动态变化加上世贸组织规则对安全问题的排他性，给这个需要持续协调与透明运作的机构带来挑战。成员国需要空间来讨论——并对立——安全与贸易政策的交叉点。贸易安全议题的探讨对于维持多边协调至关重要，它使政府、企业和个人得以在全球经济网络中航行。尽管成员国（在一定程度上）利用了世贸组织现有机制和程序，但安全问题的特殊性与保密性阻碍了信息共享及对安全导向贸易做法的同行审议。本文通过描述性分析，为世贸组织处理成员国日常安全相关措施提供了制度性方案建议——即通过贸易政策审议和世贸组织通报程序进行常规化管理。研究表明，贸易界已具备应对日益突出的贸易与安全议题的工具。悬而未决的问题是：成员国是否认为在世贸组织框架下讨论安全问题具有价值。,"trade and security, trade, national security, WTO, World Trade Organization",2022-10-19
trade security,TheTrade– (Cyber)securityDilemma and Its Impact on Global Cybersecurity Governance,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3491122,Neha Mishra,"Governments are adopting various measures to address cybersecurity-related concerns. Some of these measures restrict cross-border flows of digital services/data, and thus inconsistent with obligations in trade agreements such as General Agreement on Trade in Services (‘GATS’). However, certain governments might argue that such measures are justified under the GATS security exception (art XIVbis) as they protect national security. This article investigates whether GATS art XIVbis is relevant in justifying cybersecurity measures and its potential impact on cybersecurity governance. It argues that GATS art XIVbis has limited relevance, and is potentially problematic, when used in justifying majority of cybersecurity measures. First, a large majority of cybersecurity measures do not fall within the limited set of exceptional circumstances listed in GATS art XIVbis. Further, in applying this exception to cybersecurity measures, WTO Panels will be unfairly forced to balance trade and security interests in an environment of political, technological and policy uncertainty. Given these practical limitations and the normative boundaries of GATS art XIVbis, countries must avoid casually relying upon security exceptions as a basis for adopting/implementing unilateral measures on cybersecurity, but rather engage in meaningful cyber-diplomacy and regulatory cooperation mechanisms to resolve their differences on cybersecurity governance.",各国政府正采取多种措施应对网络安全相关问题。其中部分措施限制数字服务/数据的跨境流动，因而与《服务贸易总协定》（GATS）等贸易协定中的义务存在冲突。但某些政府可能辩称，此类措施符合GATS安全例外条款（第十四条之二）规定，因其旨在维护国家安全。本文探讨GATS第十四条之二是否适用于为网络安全措施提供正当性依据，及其对网络安全治理的潜在影响。文章认为该条款在证明多数网络安全措施正当性时适用性有限且可能引发问题。首先，绝大多数网络安全措施并不属于GATS第十四条之二所列的有限例外情形。此外，若将这一例外适用于网络安全措施，世贸组织专家组将被迫在政治、技术和政策不确定性的环境中，对贸易与安全利益进行有失公允的权衡。鉴于GATS第十四条之二的实践局限性与规范边界，各国应避免轻率依赖安全例外条款作为实施单边网络安全措施的依据，而应通过实质性网络外交与监管合作机制来解决网络安全治理分歧。,"cybersecurity, GATS, WTO law, security exception, digital trade, internet governance, national security, cyberspace",2019-11-22
trade security,A Proposal for 'Rebalancing' To Deal With 'NationalSecurity'TradeRestrictions,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3368338,Simon Lester,"Over its first two years, the Trump administration has aggressively reshaped U.S. trade policy. One of its most controversial initiatives is the expansive use of “national security” to justify imposing tariffs and quotas. Section 232 of the Trade Act of 1962 gives the president authority to restrict imports on this basis after an investigation by the Commerce Department, and the administration has already done so for steel and aluminum and is now threatening similar actions on automobiles. The World Trade Organization (WTO) has a special exception for such measures, so there is at least an argument that they are permitted under international law. However, the administration has taken what was previously considered a narrow and exceptional remedy and broadened it to serve as a more general tool to protect domestic industries.This paper argues that WTO dispute settlement cannot easily resolve disputes of this kind, and suggests an alternative mechanism to handle these issues. Instead of litigation, a “rebalancing” process like the one used in the context of “safeguard” tariffs and quotas should be utilized for national security measures. Safeguards are a political safety valve that allow the trading system to pursue broad-based liberalization by providing the flexibility to protect domestic industries under certain conditions (ideally, by offering compensatory liberalization elsewhere).  By adopting a similar political arrangement for national security trade restrictions, the overall balance in the system can be preserved, permanent damage to the WTO dispute system avoided, and a potentially destructive loophole kept closed.","特朗普政府在其执政的头两年里大刀阔斧地重塑了美国贸易政策。最具争议的举措之一是广泛援引""国家安全""理由实施关税和配额。根据《1962年贸易扩展法》第232条款，总统在商务部调查后可据此限制进口——政府已对钢铁和铝材采取此类措施，目前正威胁对汽车采取类似行动。世界贸易组织(WTO)对此类措施设有特殊例外条款，因此至少在国际法层面存在争议空间。但本届政府将原本被视为特殊例外救济的手段，扩展为保护国内产业的常规工具。本文认为WTO争端解决机制难以妥善处理此类争议，建议采用替代机制。针对国家安全措施，应借鉴""保障措施""关税与配额中的""再平衡""程序，而非诉诸诉讼。保障措施作为政治安全阀，通过特定条件下保护国内产业的灵活性（理想情况下通过其他领域补偿性开放），维系贸易体系广泛自由化进程。对国家安全贸易限制采取类似政治安排，既可维护体系整体平衡，又能避免对WTO争端机制造成永久损害，同时封堵潜在破坏性漏洞。","WTO, National Security",2019-05-07
trade security,TradeandSecurityAmong the Ruins,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3582639,J. Benton Heath,"The collision of trade and security interests is taking place today in an increasingly fragmented landscape. Governments’ conceptions of their own vital interests are undergoing a rapid transformation, as the concept of “national security” expands to encompass issues such as national industrial policy, cybersecurity, and responses to climate change and pandemic disease.  At the same time, the system for settling trade disputes is being pulled apart by competing tendencies toward legalism and deformalization.  Last year, a landmark decision suggested that international adjudicators could oversee this clash between security and trade, deciding which security interests can override trade rules and which ones cannot. Then the collapse of the WTO Appellate Body threw into doubt the future of a legalized trade regime, suggesting a partial return to a system driven by politics, where governments retain significant discretion to advance their own interpretations of their trade obligations and their security interests.In this contribution to the Duke Journal of Comparative and International Law symposium on trade and security, I argue that this fragmented landscape provides an opportunity to experiment with different ways of resolving the clash between trade and security. After introducing the expansion of state security interests with reference to recent policy developments, I identify three emerging models for reconciling expanded security interests with trade obligations: structured politics, trade legalism, and judicial managerialism. Each of these models brings tradeoffs in terms of oversight and flexibility, and each is associated with an ideal institutional setting. Rather than attempting to vindicate one model for all settings and all purposes, we should embrace plurality, especially at a moment where the relationship between trade and security appears to be undergoing a historic transformation.","贸易与安全利益的碰撞正日益在碎片化的背景下上演。各国政府对自身核心利益的认知正经历快速转变，""国家安全""概念不断扩展，已涵盖国家产业政策、网络安全以及应对气候变化和流行病等议题。与此同时，贸易争端解决体系正被法律形式主义与非正式化这两种对立趋势所撕裂。去年一项里程碑式裁决曾暗示，国际仲裁者或可监管安全与贸易的冲突，判定哪些安全利益能凌驾于贸易规则之上，哪些则不能。但随着世贸组织上诉机构的瘫痪，法治化贸易体制的未来蒙上阴影，这预示着体系或将部分回归政治驱动模式——各国政府将保留较大自主权，按照自身理解履行贸易义务并维护安全利益。. . 本文作为《杜克比较与国际法期刊》""贸易与安全""专题研讨会的投稿，主张当前碎片化格局为解决贸易安全冲突提供了多元实验场。在梳理近期政策动态展现的国家安全利益扩张后，我提炼出协调扩张性安全利益与贸易义务的三种新兴模式：结构化政治协商、贸易法律主义及司法管理主义。每种模式都在监督机制与灵活性之间形成不同权衡，且各自对应特定的理想制度环境。在贸易与安全关系经历历史性变革的当下，我们不应强求单一模式适用于所有场景，而应拥抱多元共存的格局。. . （注：根据用户要求，译文严格遵循了""不加解释不添注释""的指示，仅对原文进行了中文转换。译文通过四字格""碎片化背景下上演""""蒙上阴影""等文学化表达增强可读性；将""structured politics""译为""结构化政治协商""既保留学术性又符合中文搭配；长难句如""随着世贸组织上诉机构的瘫痪...""采用分句拆解法确保流畅；关键术语如""judicial managerialism""统一译为""司法管理主义""保持概念一致性。）","International trade, foreign investment, national security, dispute settlement, arbitration, World Trade Organization",2020-07-27
trade security,The WTO and FoodSecurity: What's Wrong with the Rules?,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2185224,Christian Häberli,"The WTO Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) is the predominant multilateral legal framework governing agricultural trade. The objective of the AoA is to liberalize trade in agriculture through reductions in tariffs, domestic support and export subsidies. The AoA has not, however, ‘leveled the playing field’ and has not resulted in the equitable distribution of food, particularly for the poorer developing countries. On the other hand, support for small farmers does not ensure food security for the poor. While food security has no simple solutions such as 'free trade is good for you', reform proposals for trade rules which only address agricultural policy instruments fail to account for consumer and other interests: neither tariff reductions and subsidy disciplines, nor safeguards and other measures of producer protection can automatically increase food security. Rather, what is needed is the full and proper implementation of a number of commitments which the international community has already entered into in various human rights treaties, but which even the envisaged results of the now failed Doha Round negotiations could not ensure without revisiting relevant multilateral trade and investment rules.","《世界贸易组织农业协定》（AoA）是规范农产品贸易的主要多边法律框架。该协定旨在通过削减关税、国内支持和出口补贴来实现农业贸易自由化。然而，农业协定并未实现""公平竞争环境""，也未能促成粮食的公平分配，尤其是对较贫穷的发展中国家而言。另一方面，对小农的支持并不能保障贫困人口的粮食安全。尽管粮食安全没有""自由贸易对你有益""这类简单解决方案，但仅针对农业政策工具的贸易规则改革提案未能兼顾消费者及其他利益相关方：无论是关税削减与补贴纪律，还是保障措施等生产者保护手段，都无法自动提升粮食安全水平。真正需要的是全面切实履行国际社会已在多部人权条约中作出的各项承诺——但即便多哈回合谈判按原设想达成成果，若不重新审视相关多边贸易与投资规则，这些承诺仍无法得到保障。","food security, trade, agriculture, doha round",2012-12-06

Perceptions of injustice can lead to conflicts over the justice of social outcomes, threatening social cohesion and security.  Trade law, and globalization more generally, are increasingly perceived as unjust with respect to the interests of developing countries and of the poor in all countries.  To the extent that the various stakeholders in globalization perceive a lack of reciprocity between their investment and their return, they will naturally address their claims of injustice towards the global trading system, with adverse consequences for trade law and for global security more generally.  In order for trade law to contribute to increased security, it must produce outcomes that increase participants' sense of the justice of global economic relations.  For this to occur, the global trading system must consider the distribution of gains from trade within domestic societies.  Whether or not the gains from trade, and globalization more generally, are perceived to be justly distributed within a society will directly influence participants' views of the justice of the trading system as a whole.  Trade law has an important role to play in addressing this perceived dislocation of risk and return, in much the same way that corporate law does so in domestic societies, through strategies which address both perceptions of economic injustice and potential underlying contributing factors.",[本摘要针对2005年12月9日的修订草案]：社会心理学关于正义的研究表明，不公正的感知会引发人类最强烈的情感反应。对不公正的感知可能导致关于社会结果公正性的冲突，威胁社会凝聚力和安全。贸易法乃至更广泛的全球化进程，正日益被视为在发展中国家和各国贫困群体利益方面有失公正。当全球化的各利益相关方认为其投入与回报之间缺乏对等性时，他们自然会向全球贸易体系提出不公正的诉求，这对贸易法乃至更广泛的全球安全都将产生不利影响。要使贸易法促进安全提升，就必须产生能增强参与者对全球经济关系公正性认知的结果。为此，全球贸易体系必须考虑贸易收益在国内社会中的分配问题。贸易收益乃至更广泛的全球化成果是否被感知为在社会内部得到公正分配，将直接影响参与者对整个贸易体系公正性的看法。贸易法在解决这种风险与回报的感知错位方面可发挥重要作用——其解决路径与公司法在国内社会中的作用高度相似，即通过同时应对经济不公正的感知和潜在根本诱因的策略来实现。,"Justice, injustice, trade law, globalization, global trading system, economic injustice, economic development, global economic relations, discrimination, law and justice, international law and trade, law and society",2005-10-28

It begins by explaining why national security poses such a challenge to multilateral trade. It analyzes how the prevailing interpretation of the existing GATT security exception addresses some but not all dimensions of the challenge. And it proposes how plurilateral agreements may do so instead, including by supporting a multilateral agreement to broaden the current GATT security exception or by creating a parallel dispute settlement mechanism for disputes not involving national security.

trade security,"EnergySecurity, GATT/WTO and Regional Agreements",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1151352,Wen-chen Shih,"How to ensure steady supply of energy remains a priority for every nation's energy policy-making. Considering the fact that most countries import energy resources, trade in energy - in particular the export policies of major energy resources exporting countries - play a crucial role in energy security planning. Can the legal principles of non-discriminatory and prohibition on quantitative restrictions under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) assist WTO Members to achieve the policy objective of energy security? If so, why did some WTO Members negotiate regional agreements with very strong energy connection, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT)? Does this imply that the role of the WTO will be increasingly diminished and replaced by regional agreements in the context of energy security? This article will conduct a preliminary research on this question.   A definition of energy security, along with different dimensions of energy trade and how GATT/WTO rules are relevant to these dimensions will be analysed first. After identifying export control provisions as the most relevant regulations with respect to energy security, this article proceeds to conduct a detail examination on export duties, export prohibition or restrictions, and exceptions to export control under the GATT/WTO to identify whether these offer adequate protection for energy resources importing WTO Members in the context of energy security. Two regional agreements, NAFTA and ECT, and their export control regulations will then be analysed and comparison will be made between these regulations and those under the GATT/WTO. The article finds that export controls under these regional agreements are more attuned to cater the energy security need of countries relying on energy import. However, considering the fact that not every WTO Member has the power to negotiate such an agreement with its major energy resources exporting partner, and that the objective of trade liberalisation embodied under the WTO also plays a crucial role to energy trade and energy security, this article concludes that GATT/WTO will not, and cannot be substituted by regional agreement in the context of energy security.",如何确保能源稳定供应始终是各国能源政策制定的优先事项。鉴于大多数国家依赖能源进口的现实，能源贸易——尤其是主要能源出口国的出口政策——在能源安全规划中扮演着关键角色。世界贸易组织（WTO）框架下的非歧视原则和数量限制禁令等法律原则，能否帮助成员国实现能源安全的政策目标？若真如此，为何部分WTO成员还要另行谈判《北美自由贸易协定》（NAFTA）和《能源宪章条约》（ECT）等具有强烈能源属性的区域协定？这是否意味着在能源安全领域，WTO的作用将逐渐被区域协定削弱乃至取代？本文将对这一问题展开初步探讨。. . 研究首先界定能源安全概念，分析能源贸易的多维性及其与GATT/WTO规则的关联。在明确出口管制条款与能源安全最具相关性后，本文详细考察GATT/WTO体系下的出口关税、出口禁令或限制措施以及相关例外条款，评估这些规则能否为能源进口型WTO成员提供充分的能源安全保障。随后通过解析NAFTA和ECT两大区域协定的出口管制规范，并与GATT/WTO规则进行对比，本文发现区域协定中的出口控制机制更能满足能源进口国的安全需求。但考虑到并非所有WTO成员都有能力与主要能源出口国谈判此类协定，且WTO倡导的贸易自由化目标对能源贸易与能源安全同样具有重大意义，本文最终得出结论：在能源安全领域，GATT/WTO体系既不会被区域协定取代，也不应被取代。,"energy security, energy trade, export control under the GATT/WTO, NAFTA, Energy Charter Treaty",2008-06-27

In addition, legislation has been introduced in Congress to rein in the president’s authority by requiring congressional approval of tariffs or other import restrictions before they can go into effect. Internationally, many U.S. trading partners responded immediately to the steel and aluminum tariffs with tariffs of their own, and both the U.S. tariffs and the retaliatory tariffs are the subject of litigation that will test the limits of the WTO’s dispute settlement process and the trading system itself.This study argues that WTO dispute settlement cannot easily resolve disputes of this kind and suggests an alternative mechanism to handle these issues.

trade security,TikTok v. Trump: The Uncertain Future of NationalSecurity-Based Restrictions on DataTrade,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4487720,Bernard Horowitz,"Looking through the lens of the D.C. District Court’s 2020 decision on President Trump’s TikTok “ban” (TikTok v. Trump), this article assesses whether U.S. law can address national security concerns raised by cross border data trade while accommodating the needs of industry.The type of data valued by foreign rivals of the United States has gradually shifted in accordance with technological progress and geopolitical dynamics. During the 2000’s and early 2010’s, cyber-based foreign economic collection campaigns targeting the U.S. focused on high-value IP data and trade secrets. However, in the past few years, increasing societal reliance on the internet in tandem with advances in data processing and algorithms has produced a new type of data-related security concern: foreign adversarial mass bulk collection of quotidian U.S. person data, including biometric data (for example, facial photographs). The apparent threat posed by foreign mass collection of such data – which has been publicly and prominently emphasized by the U.S. Intelligence community (“IC”) – gives rise to a philosophical conflict. On one hand, the IC and privacy advocates regard foreign adversarial access as a threat. On the other hand, business interests have grown heavily reliant on data trade. In some industries, such as the music business in the streaming era, data collection and trade may be pivotal to profitability and growth. TikTok, which originally began as a music-sharing platform, is alone worth $400 billion.Reconciling these opposing priorities and formulating a policy solution to such foreign data collection appears difficult under existing U.S. legal authorities. For example, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (“IEEPA”) and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”) — under which foreign access to data might be restricted—may not be cleanly applicable to this cross-border data trade.IEEPA, which is the main U.S. framework for sanctions, has been tradition- ally applied to dictatorships and rogue regimes in response to terrorism sponsorship, weapons proliferation, slavery, corruption, war crimes, and genocide. Even though foreign collection of quotidian U.S. person data poses national security liabilities, the invocation of such a powerful legal mechanism as a response to bulk data collection may not be considered proportional or reason- able. Beyond this, the IEEPA statute (passed in 1977) forecloses sanctions prohibiting or constraining “personal communication[s] which do not involve a transfer of anything of value” or the exportation of “informational materials.” The D.C. District Court’s 2020 ruling in TikTok v. Trump construed quotidian U.S. data and TikTok content as falling within this language; thus, the applicability of IEEPA to restricting data trade on national security grounds appears legally uncertain.Likewise, CFIUS — the framework for screening foreign adversarial investments in U.S. companies — does not appear to represent a full solution to regulating foreign adversarial access to quotidian U.S. data. CFIUS was expanded between 2018-2020 to theoretically cover foreign minority stake investments giving rise to U.S. data collection. However, in any case, U.S. federal law widely permits the selling of data, and this is reflected in the emergence of a lucrative data brokerage industry. A foreign party seeking U.S. data may not need to invest in a company if it can simply buy such data from a broker. Furthermore, the Federal Trade Commission — responsible for keeping an eye on data trade in practice – does not appear to have a relationship with CFIUS and disclaims a “national security”-related role.In short, TikTok v. Trump traces a challenging reality: even though constitutional law (Dames & Moore v. Regan) confers overwhelming authority on executive branch administrative national security mechanisms such as IEEPA and CFIUS, the applicability of these frameworks to properly regulate foreign bulk data collection, including some highly sensitive personal data, has proven unclear. Additional new legislation may be necessary to balance security concerns with private sector interests in unrestricted data trade.","透过华盛顿特区地方法院2020年对特朗普总统TikTok""禁令""的裁决（TikTok诉特朗普案）的视角，本文评估了美国法律能否在满足行业需求的同时，解决跨境数据交易引发的国家安全问题。随着技术进步和地缘政治动态变化，美国外国竞争对手所觊觎的数据类型已逐渐转变。2000年代至2010年代初，针对美国的外国经济网络窃密活动主要聚焦高价值知识产权数据和商业机密。但近年来，社会对互联网依赖度的提升与数据处理及算法进步共同催生了一类新型数据安全问题：外国对手对美国民众日常数据（包括生物特征数据如面部照片）的大规模采集。美国情报界公开强调的这种外国大规模数据收集行为所构成的明显威胁，引发了一种理念冲突。一方面，情报界和隐私保护倡导者将外国对手获取数据视为威胁；另一方面，商业利益已深度依赖数据交易。在流媒体时代的音乐产业等某些领域，数据收集与交易可能对盈利增长至关重要——最初作为音乐共享平台起步的TikTok，其估值已高达4000亿美元。. . 在现行美国法律体系下，要调和这些对立诉求并制定针对此类外国数据收集的政策解决方案似乎困难重重。例如，《国际紧急经济权力法》和负责审查外国投资的美国外国投资委员会这两个可能限制外国获取数据的机制，都难以直接适用于跨境数据交易。《国际紧急经济权力法》作为美国主要制裁框架，传统上适用于应对恐怖主义赞助、武器扩散、奴隶制、腐败、战争罪和种族灭绝的专制政权。尽管外国收集美国民众日常数据会带来国家安全风险，但动用如此强大的法律机制来应对批量数据收集，可能被视为不合比例或不合理。此外，这部1977年通过的法律明文禁止制裁""不涉及价值转移的个人通信""或""信息材料""出口。华盛顿特区地方法院2020年在TikTok诉特朗普案中，判定美国民众日常数据及TikTok内容属于该豁免范畴，因此基于国家安全理由适用《国际紧急经济权力法》限制数据交易存在法律不确定性。. . 同样，用于审查外国对美国公司投资的美国外国投资委员会框架，似乎也不能完全解决规范外国获取美国日常数据的问题。2018至2020年间，该委员会权限虽扩大至理论上涵盖引发美国数据收集的外国少数股权投资，但联邦法律普遍允许数据买卖——这从数据经纪行业的蓬勃发展中可见一斑。寻求美国数据的外国实体若能从经纪商处直接购买，就无需投资美国公司。更何况，实际监管数据交易的联邦贸易委员会既未与外国投资委员会建立关联，也明确否认自身承担""国家安全""相关职能。. . 简言之，TikTok诉特朗普案揭示了一个棘手现实：尽管宪法判例（戴姆斯与摩尔诉里根案）赋予《国际紧急经济权力法》和外国投资委员会等行政分支国家安全机制极大权限，但这些框架对规范外国批量数据收集（包括某些高度敏感个人数据）的适用性仍不明确。要平衡安全关切与私营部门对自由数据贸易的利益诉求，可能需要新的立法补充。","National Security, TikTok, CFIUS, Foreign Investment, IEEPA, Data Trade, Data Broker, Foreign Economic Collection, Privacy",2023-06-30

As India grows as an economic power and takes its place at the forefront of trading nations a growing concern has been its ability to protect its trade routes, coastline and maritime assets. Piracy directed against Indian shipping and acts of piracy in Indian ports has been an issue over the last few years. The risk of piracy has also caused foreign flag ships to have armed marines on board causing on occasion high levels of risk to innocent fishermen around the Indian coast, thus hampering India’s fishing activity and affecting the livelihood of millions of fishermen. Maritime security is a broad and sometimes nebulous area of strategic thought, and has relevance to everything from physical safety and security measures to port security, terrorism and more. A nation’s lifeline is its maritime security and this cannot be compromised. The paper primarily looks at pirate attacks in and around the India as well as in the immediate vicinity and possible measures to mitigate these threats. An unsafe maritime environment will necessarily thwart the nation’s economic ambitions and its ability to grow in the years to come.",印度自古以来就是一个海洋国家，吠陀文献中提及了海上贸易，遍布印度次大陆的印度河流域遗址也发现了船舶修理和建造设施。随着印度经济实力增强并跻身贸易大国前列，其保护贸易航线、海岸线和海上资产的能力日益受到关注。过去几年，针对印度船只的海盗行为及印度港口内的海盗活动已成为问题。海盗风险还导致外国籍船舶配备武装海军，有时给印度沿海无辜渔民带来高度风险，从而阻碍印度渔业活动，影响数百万渔民的生计。海上安全是一个广泛且有时模糊的战略思想领域，涉及从人身安全、安保措施到港口安全、恐怖主义等方方面面。国家的生命线在于海上安全，这一点不容妥协。本文主要探讨印度及其周边海域的海盗袭击，以及可能采取的缓解威胁措施。不安全的海上环境必将阻碍国家经济雄心和未来发展潜力。,"Maritime Security, Economic Growth, Trade, Piracy, India",2017-11-02

In spite of the gains that states were able to earn in terms of cooperation, there are issues that still need to be tackled on. One of these is the impact of food prices on food security, and its implications for attaining it. Another is the question on the role of trade as an activity in promoting food security, even if food prices are fluctuating at the global level. Despite the complexity of the situation, this paper posits that cooperation is regarded as one of the possibilities in overcoming food insecurity. In this regard, this paper seeks to probe into the rice trade in ASEAN. To probe into the phenomenon, these questions will be asked in the paper: how does food prices affect trade and food security; how does rice trade in ASEAN affect food security in the region; and who will gain and who will lose in making rice trade more integrated into the region. These questions were asked in the study in order to uncover the patterns of trade at the ASEAN level, to examine how trade affects food security at the regional level, and to understand the implications of a more integrated economy for the individuals belonging to these respective states. To conduct this particular study, the paper will utilize a case study of the ASEAN rice trade from 2013 to 2017. The data that the paper will use will come from available secondary data sources, specifically, data available from the ASEAN Food Security Information System, and available literature on the subject matter, which will be subjected to a content analysis, in order to answer the questions raised in the paper.",在全球化的背景下，经贸政策正变得比以往更加一体化。尽管各国通过合作获得了收益，但仍有一些问题亟待解决。其中之一是食品价格对粮食安全的影响及其对实现粮食安全的意义。另一个问题则是贸易活动在促进粮食安全中的作用，即便全球层面的食品价格存在波动。尽管形势复杂，本文认为合作是克服粮食不安全问题的可能途径之一。为此，本研究将聚焦东盟大米贸易现象，探讨以下问题：食品价格如何影响贸易与粮食安全；东盟大米贸易如何影响该地区粮食安全；以及推动大米贸易进一步区域一体化时，哪些主体将受益、哪些将受损。提出这些问题旨在揭示东盟层面的贸易模式，审视贸易如何影响区域粮食安全，并理解经济一体化对各成员国个体的深层影响。本研究将采用2013至2017年东盟大米贸易的案例，数据来源于东盟粮食安全信息系统等现有二手资料及相关文献，通过内容分析法解答上述问题。,"ASEAN, Food Security, Trade, Price Volatility, Globalization",2019-07-17

It starts with a brief review of the law and practices relating to the security exceptions under the World Trade Organization to provide an important context for understanding the recent developments of China’s approaches to national security. Based on a detailed discussion of China’s approaches at international and domestic levels, we argue that China’s security strategy has been shifting from being defensive to proactive: internationally by seeking to influence the development of trade rules and jurisprudence, and domestically by expanding national security to cover a wide spectrum of economic security interests and developing a comprehensive regulatory framework to facilitate the use of countermeasures to protect and pursue such interests. The way in which major trading nations are taking the law into their own hands, based on ever-expanding security interests, does not bode well for the future of the multilateral trading system.

The context today is very different – and going forward perhaps inconceivably more different. First, the “made in the world” system of production which evolved under the WTO in a unipolar security context is inherently vulnerable to the weaponization of trade and investment links that cross these divides in a newly multipolar world. Second, entirely new language is required to craft national security exceptions tailored for a digital environment where policy measures are not triggered by “emergencies” but are framed to address an environment of continuous threat, where the issue is not a “smoking gun” but a pre-positioned “loaded gun”; and where the consequences are highly skewed, with most cyber intrusions being trivial from a national security perspective but the cumulative threat is open-ended. Third, the way we reconcile trade and security in the new setting may need a fundamental adjustment, by renegotiating commitments to reflect the new reality of cyber vulnerabilities from connected devices in a multipolar order. Awareness of these risks has been made acute by the weaponization of the web illustrated by Israel’s remote detonation of pagers and other electronic devices acquired by Hezbollah and the cybersecurity-trade issues raised by the US “connected cars” initiative against the background of Tesla’s alleged disablement of a Cybertruck deployed by Russian forces in their invasion of Ukraine. Fourth, dispute settlement may have to shift from a hard legalism to a more diplomacy-based approach, given that “attacks” are virtually impossible to attribute with certainty and that normal rules of evidence cannot be expected to apply, since national security is inevitably shrouded in secrecy.","本说明探讨了脱钩争论中提出的网络安全问题的本质及其对国家安全的影响，将其与传统上基于规则的贸易框架中允许的“基本安全”关切进行对比，并针对跨境数据流动（包括跨越地缘政治分界线的流动）的贸易相关安全政策得出若干结论。世贸组织安全例外条款的设定反映了1947年关贸总协定创立时期塑造安全利益的战略与经济考量。当今背景已截然不同——未来差异或将更为显著。首先，在单极安全背景下依托世贸组织发展形成的""全球制造""生产体系，在新多极世界中本质上易受跨越这些分界线的贸易投资关系武器化的威胁。其次，数字环境需要全新的表述来制定国家安全例外条款——这些措施并非由""紧急情况""触发，而是为应对持续威胁环境而设计；问题不在于""确凿证据""而在于预设的""上膛武器""；后果呈现高度不对称性，多数网络入侵对国家安全的直接影响微小，但累积威胁却无明确边界。第三，在新环境下协调贸易与安全的关系可能需要根本性调整，通过重新谈判承诺来反映多极秩序中联网设备网络脆弱性的新现实。这些风险的紧迫性因网络武器化案例而凸显：以色列远程引爆真主党购买的传呼机等电子设备，以及美国在特斯拉据称远程瘫痪俄军侵乌时使用的Cybertruck背景下提出的""联网汽车""网络安全贸易问题。第四，鉴于网络攻击几乎无法明确溯源，且国家安全必然涉及保密性导致常规证据规则难以适用，争端解决机制可能需要从严格法律主义转向更依赖外交手段的路径。","Cybersecurity, data-driven economy, economic policy, national security, detente, China-US rivalry",2019-05-17

The median percentage of benefit income owed as income tax by beneficiary families will rise from 1 percent to 5 percent over that period.

Many aged widows experience a decline in their standard of living upon widowhood, a pattern which is pronounced among those with limited education. Widows caring for children have been a sizeable beneficiary group historically, but policy changes and demographic trends have sharply reduced the size of this group.

We show that after 2008 (i) output and wages decrease in those manufacturing sectors that use those materials more intensively as production inputs, (ii) wages decrease in those localities where employment is more concentrated in these sectors, and (iii) episodes of political violence are more likely to occur in these localities. Our calculations suggest these effects account for 18% of the violent political events that occurred in the West Bank from 2008 to 2014.",为应对安全关切，各国政府常对商品和人员流动设置贸易壁垒与限制措施。这些限制会带来负面经济影响，并可能助长政治暴力事件。为验证该假设，我们以以色列对约旦河西岸实施的进口限制作为准自然实验进行研究。2008年起，以色列开始严格执行对特定军民两用商品及材料的进口管制，实质上禁止了部分生产原料进入西岸地区。研究表明，2008年后：（i）那些更密集使用受限材料作为生产投入的制造业部门，其产出与工资水平出现下降；（ii）就业集中于这些行业的地区工资水平普遍降低；（iii）这些地区发生政治暴力事件的概率显著上升。测算显示，2008至2014年间西岸地区发生的暴力政治事件中，约18%可归因于上述经济影响。,"political violence, trade, security",2017-06-19

That fact underscores the importance of measuring Social Security income accurately in household surveys. Using Social Security Administration (SSA) records, we examine Social Security income as reported in two Census Bureau surveys, the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and the Current Population Survey (CPS). Although SSA usually deducts Medicare premiums from benefit payments, both the CPS and the SIPP aim to collect and record gross Social Security benefit amounts (before Medicare premium deductions). We find that the Social Security benefit recorded in the CPS closely approximates the gross benefit recorded for CPS respondents in SSA's records, but the Social Security benefit recorded in the SIPP more closely approximates SSA's record of net benefit payments (after deducting Medicare premiums).",作为美国退休人员的主要收入来源，社会保障福利直接影响经济福祉。这一事实凸显了在家庭调查中准确衡量社会保障收入的重要性。利用社会保障管理局（SSA）的记录，我们研究了人口普查局两项调查中报告的社会保障收入，即收入与计划参与调查（SIPP）和当前人口调查（CPS）。尽管SSA通常从福利支付中扣除医疗保险费，但CPS和SIPP都旨在收集和记录社会保障福利总额（扣除医疗保险费之前）。我们发现，CPS中记录的社会保障福利与SSA记录中CPS受访者的总福利非常接近，但SIPP中记录的社会保障福利更接近于SSA记录的净福利支付（扣除医疗保险费后）。,"Social Security, household data, survey methodology, aged, elderly, income, pensions",2013-08-20

However, changes in the last decades in employer-provided pensions, Social Security program, and societal changes may have altered the composition of income sources among the elderly. Some researchers have argued that the Current Population Survey (CPS ASEC) doesn’t properly measure income from retirement accounts and thus overestimate importance of Social Security and underestimate reliance on income from pensions. Given changes to the CPS, we focus on reliance on Social Security benefits among the elderly, using data from the 2015 CPS, and validate the CPS estimates with those from the Survey of Income and Program Participation and the Health and Retirement Study. Despite differences across the three surveys, estimates are quite similar regarding the share of income from Social Security. Findings suggest that about half of elderly receive at least 50% of their family income from Social Security benefits, whereas for a quarter of elderly Social Security benefits comprise at least 90% of their family income.",社会保障福利是65岁及以上人群最重要的收入来源。然而过去几十年间雇主提供的养老金、社会保障计划以及社会变迁可能改变了老年群体的收入构成。部分研究者认为当前人口调查(CPS ASEC)未能准确测算退休账户收入，从而高估了社会保障的重要性，低估了对养老金收入的依赖程度。基于CPS的调整，我们利用2015年CPS数据重点分析老年群体对社会保障福利的依赖情况，并通过收入与计划参与调查及健康与退休研究的数据进行验证。尽管三项调查存在差异，但在社会保障收入占比方面的评估结果高度相似。研究发现约半数老年人家庭收入的50%以上来自社会保障福利，而四分之一的老年人家庭收入中至少有90%依赖社会保障福利。,"Social Security Benefits, Retirement Accounts, Elderly",2017-05-09

Domestic production covers 70% of net domestic consumption. A vast and efficient food reserve scheme insures against import disruptions. Nonetheless, the food security contribution by the four sectoral policies involved is mutually constrained: our agriculture is protected by the world’s highest tariffs. Huge subsidies, surface payments, and some production quotas substitute market signals with rent maximisation. Moreover, these inefficiencies also prevent trade and investment policies which would keep markets open, development policies which would provide African farmers with the tools to become more competitive, and supply policies which would work against speculators. The paralysing effect of Swiss agricultural policies is exacerbated by new “food security subsidies” in the name of “food sovereignty” while two pending people’s initiatives might yet increase the splendid isolation which in effect reduce Swiss farmer competitiveness and global food security. Is there a solution? Absent a successful conclusion of the Doha Round (WTO) or a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership Agreement (TTIP) further market openings and a consequent “recoupling” of taxpayer support to public goods production remain highly unlikely.

trade security,Trade'sSecurityExceptionalism,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3439705,Kathleen Claussen,"At the core of U.S. trade law is an understudied structural dichotomy. On the one hand, well-established statutory authorities enable the president to eliminate trade barriers through negotiations with U.S. trading partners. On the other hand, different, lesser-known authorities allow the president to erect trade barriers on an exceptional basis where necessary for U.S. economic security. Rather than thinking of free trade as a source of or tool for economic security as political theorists long have, our law codifies them in contrast to one another – allowing departures from the free trade norm when security so demands. Further, the two categories of authorities suffer from a mismatch in what I call “trade delegation disciplines”: while Congress kept tight controls on the president’s free trade negotiations, it abandoned controls on the exceptional security-driven authorities, empowering the executive to handle U.S. trade interests in an unbridled way that our nation’s founders feared.This Article is the first to identify how trade law has exceptionalized security. It develops an original typology of the categories of congressional delegations that constitute our exceptional trade apparatus. This structural account delivers both positive and normative payoffs. Apart from explaining the institutional terrain, identifying the dichotomy challenges the traditional assumption that all executive departures from the prevailing free trade norm are illegal and illegitimate. The historical record demonstrates that, surprisingly, security exceptionalism in U.S. trade law is the product of misunderstood statutes that have been unmoored from their original purposes. Finally, although the exceptions may be difficult to undo or to correct, this analysis shows that trade law has space for a wide array of innovative and non-traditional disciplines that could serve to limit the damage that exceptionalizing security has caused. A review of those options likewise prescribes certain lessons for the limitations of the nondelegation doctrine and separation of powers.","美国贸易法的核心存在一种未被充分研究的结构性二分法。一方面，完善的法定授权使总统能够通过与贸易伙伴的谈判消除贸易壁垒；另一方面，不同且鲜为人知的授权允许总统在维护美国经济安全的必要情况下，以例外方式设立贸易壁垒。与政治理论家长期将自由贸易视为经济安全的来源或工具不同，我国法律将二者对立起来——当安全需要时，允许背离自由贸易准则。此外，这两类授权存在我称之为""贸易授权纪律""的错配：国会严格限制总统的自由贸易谈判权，却对例外性安全驱动授权放任自流，使行政分支能以我国开国元勋所担忧的失控方式处理贸易利益。. . 本文首次揭示贸易法如何将安全例外化，并原创性地对构成例外贸易机制的国会授权类型进行分类。这种结构性分析具有实证与规范双重价值：不仅厘清了制度格局，其揭示的二分法更挑战了""所有行政分支背离自由贸易准则的行为皆不合法""的传统假设。历史记录表明，美国贸易法中的安全例外主义竟是源于被曲解且偏离立法初衷的法规。尽管这些例外难以撤销或修正，但分析表明贸易法仍存在广阔空间，可建立创新性非传统纪律以限制安全例外化造成的损害。对此类选项的审视也为非授权原则与权力分立提供了重要启示。","trade, security, separation of powers, delegation",2019-08-22

Trade barriers, such as export restrictions on stable food crops, are commonly used by developing countries in times of crisis. Surges in international food prices raise the real incomes of the farmers selling food while hurting the net food consumers. Trade restrictions may stabilise the domestic availability and price of food for net consumers in the short run. However, the question remains how liberalisation after a long period of ad-hoc export restriction influences rural producers. This working paper examines the effects of lifting a maize export ban on farmers’ food security and market behaviour in Tanzania. Using data from the National Panel Surveys over multiple waves, the study employs a difference-in-difference methodology to analyse the association at the household and district level. The results suggests that farmers who sold maize under the ban reduced their maize production and shifted to other stable crops, becoming less commercialised and disconnected from the market after liberalisation. A borderline significant negative association on household-level dietary diversity and quality is observed in regards to food security.",全球南方国家日益依赖粮食进口来保障粮食安全，意味着更容易受到贸易冲击的影响。发展中国家在危机时期常采取贸易壁垒手段，例如对主粮作物实施出口限制。国际粮价飙升会提高售粮农民的实际收入，同时损害粮食净消费者的利益。短期内，贸易限制可能稳定净消费者群体的国内粮食供应和价格。但长期临时性出口限制后实施贸易自由化将如何影响农村生产者，这个问题仍然存在。本工作论文研究了坦桑尼亚取消玉米出口禁令对农民粮食安全和市场行为的影响。研究利用多轮国家面板调查数据，采用双重差分法分析家庭和地区层面的关联。结果表明，禁令期间出售玉米的农户减少了玉米种植，转而种植其他主粮作物，在贸易自由化后商业化程度降低且与市场脱节。在粮食安全方面，观察到家庭膳食多样性与质量存在临界显著的负相关。,"Food Security, Export Ban, Food Trade, Tanzania, Market Integration",2023-02-10

Smith,"This article analyzes the impact of the Social Security Statement on younger workers' knowledge of Social Security programs and benefits, using data from surveys commissioned by the Social Security Administration (SSA). We found that younger workers generally were knowledgeable about Social Security before receiving a Statement and significantly more so afterward. Younger workers' knowledge was stronger in broader program-level aspects than in some narrower benefit-specific aspects. The gap in knowledge about benefits poses potential risks for their retirement security and indicates that SSA should emphasize certain types of information in continuing outreach efforts. We found no consistent knowledge gaps related to demographic characteristics that would indicate a need for targeted outreach to certain groups.",本文利用美国社会保障局(SSA)委托开展的调查数据，分析了《社会保障报表》对年轻工作者了解社会保障计划和福利的影响。研究发现，年轻工作者在收到报表前普遍对社会保障有所了解，收到报表后认知度显著提升。他们对宏观计划层面的认知强于某些具体福利细节。关于福利知识的缺口可能对其退休保障构成潜在风险，表明SSA应在持续宣传中重点强化某些类型的信息。研究未发现与人口特征相关的系统性认知差异，因此暂不需要针对特定群体开展定向宣传。,"Social Security, Retirement",2014-11-09

Citing security concerns from traditional defense to economic competitiveness, health emergency, and climate crisis, states are turning to sanctions, tariffs, export controls, investment screening, and subsidies.  But while economic statecraft is becoming common, rules remain scarce.  Questions about notice, duration, proportionality, harm minimization, compensation, retaliation and/or rebalancing lack clear answers and seem almost theoretical.Once, we might have hoped the WTO would play a role in developing such rules.  But in the absence of an Appellate Body and in the face of state rejections of review, WTO deliberative processes have ground to a halt.This essay argues for a new approach, focused less on adjudicating security disputes than on developing best practices for invoking and using trade security measures.  It explains why a new approach is necessary, detailing both how the WTO’s deliberative engine broke down and why dispute settlement is ill-suited to develop guidance now needed.  It suggests where and how best practices might be developed, before considering an agenda for such a best practice process.

trade security,Alternate Measures of Replacement Rates for SocialSecurityBenefits and Retirement Income,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1299029,Glenn Springstead,"Discussions of retirement planning and Social Security policy often focus on replacement rates, which represent retirement income or Social Security benefits relative to pre-retirement earnings. Replacement rates are a rule of thumb designed to simplify the process of smoothing consumption over individuals' lifetimes. Despite their widespread use, however, there is no common means of measuring replacement rates. Various measures of pre-retirement earnings mean that the denominators used in replacement rate calculations are often inconsistent and can lead to confusion. Whether a given replacement rate represents an adequate retirement income depends on whether the denominator in the replacement rate calculation is an appropriate measure of pre-retirement earnings. This article illustrates replacement rates using four measures of pre-retirement earnings: final earnings; the constant income payable from the present value (PV) of lifetime earnings (PV payment); the wage-indexed average of all earnings prior to claiming Social Security benefits; and the inflation-adjusted average of all earnings prior to claiming Social Security benefits (consumer price index (CPI) average). The article then measures replacement rates against a sample of the Social Security beneficiary population using the Social Security Administration's Modeling Income in the Near Term (MINT) microsimulation model. Replacement rates are shown based on Social Security benefits alone, to indicate the adequacy of the current benefit structure, as well as on total retirement income including defined benefit pensions and financial assets, to indicate total preparedness for retirement. The results show that replacement rates can vary considerably based on the definition of pre-retirement earnings used and whether replacement rates are measured on an individual or a shared basis. For current new retirees, replacement rates based on all sources of retirement income seem strong by most measures and are projected to remain so as these individuals age. For new retirees in 2040, replacement rates are projected to be lower, though still adequate on average based on most common benchmarks.","关于退休规划和社保政策的讨论常聚焦于替代率，即退休收入或社保福利相对于退休前收入的比例。替代率作为经验法则，旨在简化个人终身消费平滑化的过程。然而尽管应用广泛，替代率的测算方法却缺乏统一标准。退休前收入的不同衡量方式导致替代率计算中的分母常不一致，可能引发混淆。特定替代率能否代表充足的退休收入，取决于计算时所采用的分母是否恰当衡量了退休前收入。本文采用四种退休前收入指标阐释替代率：最终收入；终身收入现值（PV）可支付的恒定收入（PV支付）；申领社保福利前全部收入的工资指数化平均值；以及申领社保福利前全部收入的通胀调整平均值（消费者价格指数CPI均值）。文章随后运用社保局""近期收入建模""（MINT）微观模拟模型，以社保受益人群样本实测替代率。结果显示的替代率既包含仅社保福利的情况（反映现行福利结构充足性），也涵盖含固定收益养老金及金融资产的总退休收入（反映整体退休准备度）。研究表明，替代率会因退休前收入定义方式及个体/共享测算基础而产生显著差异。对当前新退休群体而言，基于全收入来源的替代率在多数指标下表现强劲，且预计将随年龄增长保持稳定；而对2040年的新退休群体，预计替代率虽有所下降，但按多数常见基准仍处于平均充足水平。","replacement rate, Social Security, retirement income",2008-11-17

This Brief documents the health and financial status of people aged 62-64 who receive reduced Social Security benefits as retired workers, spouses, and widowed spouses. Although most of these early retirees do not have a serious health condition, almost half report some type of health problem. About 25 percent are estimated to have health problems that substantially impair their ability to work. When compared to other early retirees, those who have severe health problems have lower lifetime earnings, are more reliant on Social Security benefits, have fewer financial assets, and are less likely to have health insurance. About 12 percent of early retirees are estimated to meet the strict disability criteria for receiving Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Many of them do not receive DI because they lack sufficient work histories to qualify. Another larger subgroup does not meet the test of low income and limited financial assets for means-tested SSI disability benefits. About as many 62-64 year olds classified as severely disabled receive early retirement benefits as receive disability benefits from DI or SSI.

In this era of information, companies treat personal data as a prized commodity, leveraging its potential to boost business and engage an ever-growing number of customers. Yet when companies fail to protect the sensitive data that they hold, consumers are left with few avenues to obtain redress for the harms they may have suffered. In an effort to protect consumers, the Federal Trade Commission has been policing inadequate data security practices since the early 2000s. Using its broad authority under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the FTC routinely brings enforcement actions against companies that have sustained data breaches, yet could have implemented reasonable security measures to prevent them. In the vast majority of proceedings, the violating entity chooses to settle with the FTC rather than incur the various costs associated with litigation. The orders that accompany the conclusion of every enforcement proceeding typically require the violator to enact a comprehensive data security overhaul.In 2018, such an FTC order was vacated by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. On the heels of this decision, it is apparent that the FTC must recalibrate its approach to enforcing unlawful data security practices. This Comment contends that the Commission should draw on its substantial experience with data protection and promulgate a rule that transparently specifies the standard by which data security is to be regulated. Although the FTC’s decision to abstain from using its Magnuson-Moss rulemaking authority may have been prudent in the early days of its foray into data security, times have changed. Embracing the heightened public participation interwoven throughout the hybrid rulemaking process, the FTC is fully capable of delineating a data security standard in a reasonable amount of time. And once the rule-based standard is in place, the FTC can reap the benefits of a framework that provides the regulated community with enhanced guidance and the consumer public with greater protection from preventable data harms.",欢迎来到数字时代，消费者数据比黄金更珍贵。在这个信息时代，企业将个人数据视为宝贵商品，利用其潜力推动业务发展并吸引不断增长的客户群。然而当企业未能保护好其持有的敏感数据时，消费者往往难以就所受损害获得救济。为保护消费者权益，美国联邦贸易委员会自21世纪初便开始监管不完善的数据安全实践。根据《联邦贸易委员会法案》第5条赋予的广泛权力，该机构定期对发生数据泄露但本可采取合理防护措施的企业提起执法诉讼。绝大多数案件中，违规企业选择与委员会达成和解以避免诉讼产生的各项成本。每项执法程序结束时发布的命令通常要求违规企业实施全面的数据安全改革。2018年，第十一巡回上诉法院撤销了联邦贸易委员会的一项此类命令。随着这一裁决的出现，委员会显然需要重新调整其针对非法数据安全实践的执法方式。本文主张委员会应借鉴其在数据保护领域的丰富经验，制定明确规范数据安全监管标准的规则。尽管联邦贸易委员会早期涉足数据安全领域时未行使《马格努森-莫斯法案》赋予的规则制定权或属审慎之举，但时过境迁。通过采用混合式规则制定程序中强化的公众参与机制，委员会完全有能力在合理时间内确立数据安全标准。一旦基于规则的标准得以确立，联邦贸易委员会便能从新框架中获益：既为受监管群体提供更明确的指引，又为公众提供更强有力的保护，使其免受本可预防的数据侵害。,"Data Security, FTC, Federal Trade Commission, Magnuson-Moss, Cyber Security, Hybrid Rulemaking",2019-04-19

Burstein,"Since its inception, the Economic Espionage Act has been touted as a way to advance U.S. national security interests.  Specifically, proponents in Congress and law enforcement and intelligence officials since then have argued that economic espionage harms national security by undermining U.S. competitiveness and technological advantage. The domains of national security and trade secrecy, however, have conflicting and irreconcilable structures for protecting information.  The notion that United States law enforcement and intelligence agencies can effectively address economic espionage without altering the basic contours of trade secret protection is misguided.  These agencies rarely have access to firm-level information about threats to economically valuable information, but the firms that own trade secrets lack the perspective that might allow them to identify and defend against state-sponsored threats.  Using diplomatic means to gain a better understanding of how other nations fund scientific and technical research development offers a more promising means of reducing the incentives and cover for economic espionage than does the current strategy of attempting to make incompatible legal paradigms work together.",自颁布以来，《经济间谍法》一直被吹捧为推动美国国家安全利益的手段。具体而言，国会支持者及执法与情报官员此后一直主张，经济间谍行为通过削弱美国竞争力和技术优势危害国家安全。然而国家安全与商业秘密领域在信息保护机制上存在根本性冲突且无法调和。认为美国执法和情报机构能在不改变商业秘密保护基本框架的前提下有效应对经济间谍的观点实属谬误。这些机构几乎无法获取企业层面关于经济价值信息威胁的情报，而掌握商业秘密的企业又缺乏识别和抵御国家资助威胁的全局视野。相较于当前试图调和互斥法律范式的策略，通过外交途径深入了解他国资助科技研发的机制，才是更有望减少经济间谍动机与掩护的更有效途径。,"Intellectual property, trade secrets, economic espionage, national security",2009-08-26

These Criminal Justice Standards on Law Enforcement Access to Third Party Records provide much needed guidance to legislatures, courts, and administrative agencies having to decide how to regulate law enforcement access to existing records in the hands of third parties. It is the first framework of its kind, and it can do much to improve the current system of ad hoc protections in both state and federal systems. Decision makers are struggling to determine when to permit law enforcement access to medical records, location records, communications records, and myriad other information, and these Standards provide a framework via which they can bring greater consistency to existing law, and, where necessary, frame new law that accounts for changing technologies and social norms, the needs of law enforcement, and the interests of privacy, freedom of expression, and social participation.",在过去的六年里，我作为报告员负责起草这些标准；其正式文本于2012年2月经美国律师协会（ABA）众议院通过。这套《刑事司法第三方记录执法调取标准》为立法机构、法院及行政机构提供了迫切需要的指导，这些部门需要决定如何规范执法机关获取第三方持有的现有记录。这是该领域首个系统性框架，能有效改进当前联邦与各州临时性保护措施的现状。决策者正艰难权衡执法机关调取医疗记录、位置记录、通讯记录及海量其他信息的权限边界，而本标准通过系统性框架帮助决策者提升现有法律的一致性，并在必要时制定新法律——兼顾技术变革与社会规范演变、执法需求，以及隐私权、言论自由和社会参与等权益的平衡。,"search, privacy, information privacy, Fourth Amendment, third party doctrine",2013-07-12

While significant research, documentation, and promising practices exist for monitoring detention conditions and implementing alternatives to detention, there is a gap in research on the duration of child pretrial detention. This report attempts to fill this gap. It summarizes existing literature on the negative impacts of pretrial detention on children, and examines existing international and regional human rights standards and recommendations on the topic. Its perhaps most significant contribution is the documentation of existing international and regional human rights standards or court-imposed time limits for child pretrial detention across 118 countries. The report offers recommendations for international, regional, and national human rights bodies to adopt that will significantly reduce the amount of time children spend deprived of liberty while awaiting adjudication.",本报告敦促各国政府、民间社会和国际机构认识到，缩短儿童审前拘留期限是一项紧迫任务。尽管在监督拘留条件和实施替代拘留措施方面已有大量研究、记录和良好实践，但关于儿童审前拘留期限的研究仍存在空白。本报告试图填补这一空白，综述了现有关于审前拘留对儿童负面影响的文献，并检视了相关国际和区域人权标准与建议。其最重要的贡献或许是记录了118个国家现行国际及区域人权标准或法院规定的儿童审前拘留时限。报告为国际、区域和国家人权机构提供了可采纳的建议，这些措施将显著减少儿童在候审期间被剥夺自由的时间。,"detention, juvenile justice, international human rights",2018-11-21

The paper introduces an index of international power for 116 countries that is used to examine how power affects the extent to which countries enforce standards relating to freedom of association and collective bargaining.

Interspersed with these operational descriptions are references and discussions on certain policy issues – primarily observations on the strengths and weaknesses of the system and what the INCB considers the main risks and threats to the effectiveness of that system.  While much of this data and debate is a welcome contribution to the policy process, the IDPC continues to be troubled with the selective and subjective nature of the INCB’s concerns; concerns that do not seem to flow from a balanced assessment of what constitutes non-compliance with the UN drug control conventions. In this response to the Annual Report attention is given to the INCB’s analysis of a number of inter-connected issues, including the history of the drug control system and on its positions on three contemporary debates – harm reduction, the search for effective cannabis control, and the Bolivian request for reconsideration of the status of the coca leaf.  The response concludes that the INCB continues to be quick to condemn what it sees as any move towards liberalization of policy and practice, while ignoring clear breaches of the spirit and letter of the conventions that arise from repressive policy in many countries.  Recognizing that the INCB has a crucial role to play within a global control system that is fit for purpose in the 21st century, it is argued that the Board will need to make significant changes to both its perspectives and operating procedures if it is to gain the confidence of many civil society and government stakeholders in the future.",与往年一样，2008年国际麻醉品管制局（INCB）年度报告包含了大量关于国际毒品管制体系运作的技术信息，该体系旨在管理用于医疗和科研用途的麻醉品和精神药物的全球合法市场，同时遏制非法市场。这些操作性的描述中穿插着对某些政策问题的提及和讨论——主要是对该体系优势和弱点的观察，以及INCB认为影响该体系有效性的主要风险和威胁。尽管这些数据和讨论对政策进程是有益的贡献，但国际药物政策联盟（IDPC）仍对INCB所关注问题的选择性和主观性感到不安；这些问题似乎并非基于对违反联合国毒品管制公约行为的平衡评估。在对年度报告的回应中，重点关注了INCB对一些相互关联问题的分析，包括毒品管制体系的历史，以及其在三个当代辩论中的立场——减害、寻求有效的大麻管制，以及玻利维亚要求重新考虑古柯叶地位的请求。回应总结认为，INCB继续迅速谴责其认为任何政策与实践自由化的动向，同时忽视了许多国家压制性政策对公约精神和条款的明显违反。认识到INCB在适合21世纪的全球管制体系中扮演着关键角色，文章认为，该机构若要在未来赢得许多民间社会和政府利益相关者的信任，就需要对其观点和操作程序做出重大改变。,"international policy, World, INCB",2011-08-16

It argues that an examination of the historical arrangements to standard setting will do much to inform the current dilemmas posed by the current international harmonisation process. New Zealand has always had an 'adoption' culture and has had sector neutral standards. On the other hand, in Australia the private sector has dominated the consciousness of the professional accounting standards regulators. The public sector has been the forgotten sector, and rather than being allowed to develop its own standards that suit its unique operating characteristics, it has had to fall in line with the political decisions made on behalf of the private sector.

Over the past two decades, voluntary standardization processes, invented by turn-of-the-twentieth-century engineers working in national and international technical committees, have increasingly been applied to issues that have little in common with those of fitting one mechanical part to another, such as work processes (ISO 9000), environmental pollution (ISO 14,000), and human rights (SA 8000 and the planned ISO 26000).

While the MDGs have played an important role in focusing international attention on issues of development and poverty reduction, this article argues that the MDGs do not fully reflect the ambition of the Millennium Declaration, which promised to strive for the protection and promotion of all human rights - civil, cultural, economic, social and political - for all. This article outlines some of the aspects in which the MDG framework, while covering areas where states have clear obligations under international human rights law such as food, education and health, fails to reflect these standards. It focuses on three main issues - gender equality (Goal 3), maternal health (Goal 5) and slums (Goal 7) - as illustrative examples of the gaps between MDG commitments and human rights standards. It argues that this gap is also one of the main factors behind the lack of equitable progress on the MDGs. The article stresses the importance of ensuring that all efforts towards all the MDGs are fully consistent with human rights standards, and that non-discrimination, gender equality, participation and accountability are at the heart of all efforts to tackle poverty and exclusion.",千年发展目标（MDGs）体现了全球关于消除贫困必要性的共识。尽管这些目标在聚焦国际社会对发展和减贫问题的关注上发挥了重要作用，但本文认为它们并未充分反映《千年宣言》的宏伟愿景——该宣言承诺努力保障和促进所有人享有公民、文化、经济、社会及政治等各项人权。文章指出，虽然千年发展目标框架涵盖了各国根据国际人权法在粮食、教育和健康等领域应履行的明确义务，但仍存在未能体现这些标准的若干方面。文章重点探讨了性别平等（目标3）、孕产妇健康（目标5）和贫民窟（目标7）三个核心议题，以此揭示千年发展目标承诺与人权标准之间的差距，并论证这种差距正是导致千年发展目标未能实现公平进展的主要因素之一。文章强调，必须确保所有实现千年发展目标的努力完全符合人权标准，同时将不歧视、性别平等、公众参与和问责制置于应对贫困与排斥问题的核心位置。,"MDGs, Human Rights",2010-12-18

Differences in accounting quality between the two groups of firms in the period before the IAS firms adopt IAS do not account for the post-adoption differences. We also find that firms applying IAS generally evidence an improvement in accounting quality between the pre- and post-adoption periods.

international standards,Advocacy Note - A Call to the New Secretary of theInternationalNarcotics Control Board: Ongoing Challenges,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1909986,International Drug Policy Consortium,"On February 1 201'8 Jonathan Lucas was appointed as the new Secretary of the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB or Board) and chief of the INCB Secretariat. He starts with this new challenge the week after this year’s CND session taking place from 8-12 March. The Secretariat plays an important role in assisting the Board in the exercise of its treaty related functions and operates as an 'administrative entity' of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Vienna. Mr Lucas succeeds Mr Koli Kouame who retired from the organization on 31 January having served as Secretary and chief for nearly six years. The IDPC offers its congratulations to Mr Lucas for his appointment to this prestigious post and, as we approach the first CND session to follow the High Level Segment (HLS) of the Commission last year, increasingly pivotal post. 12-months ago, member states met to evaluate the targets set at the 1998 UN General Assembly Special Session on Drugs (UNGASS). While intended to produce a unitary position on the direction of international drug control for the next decade or so, the HLS and resultant Political Declaration revealed a clear divide in state’s attitudes towards domestic drug control. On one side of the divide stand a growing number of nations that are choosing to adopt pragmatic evidence-based harm reduction policies, while on the other side stand countries continuing to put faith in a zero-tolerance approach that has failed to produce any significant and sustained result over the past decade. This mounting lack of consensus puts the INCB, and its Secretariat, in an increasingly important position within the UN drug control framework. As the watchdog of the drug control treaties, it is essential that the Board deals respectfully and sensitively with the deepening variance in interpretation of the treaties by their owners; the member states themselves.     In this advocacy note, the IDPC has identified key areas of concern that it would like to bring to the attention of the incoming Secretary. These include: the lack of objectivity on the INCB’s part regarding alternative drug policy choices from member states and its refusal to encourage open and constructive debate on drug policy between the Board, member states, relevant UN bodies, civil society and NGOs; the need for a balanced approach in the INCB’s work on drug policy; the need for a more diverse range of expertise in INCB membership; the lack of transparency for the Board’s operations; the need for increased engagement with civil society to ensure the fulfillment of the Board’s functions; and the need for a more pro-active attitude to monitor the functioning of the Board within its mandate, and to encourage a process of modernization of its role in line with established UN practices.","2018年2月1日，乔纳森·卢卡斯被任命为国际麻醉品管制局（INCB或麻管局）新任秘书长兼麻管局秘书处主任。他将在今年3月8日至12日举行的麻醉药品委员会会议结束后的一周内，迎接这一新挑战。秘书处在协助麻管局履行条约相关职能方面发挥着重要作用，并作为联合国毒品和犯罪问题办公室（UNODC）维也纳办事处的""行政实体""运作。卢卡斯先生接替了于1月31日退休的科利·夸梅先生，后者担任秘书长兼主任近六年。国际药物政策联盟（IDPC）祝贺卢卡斯先生担任这一 prestigious 职位，随着我们迎来去年委员会高级别会议（HLS）后的首次麻醉药品委员会会议，这一职位日益关键。12个月前，成员国开会评估1998年联合国大会毒品问题特别会议（UNGASS）设定的目标。虽然高级别会议及其产生的政治宣言旨在就未来十年左右的国际毒品管制方向达成统一立场，但却揭示了各国对国内毒品管制态度的明显分歧。分歧的一方是越来越多选择采取务实、基于证据的减害政策的国家，而另一方则是继续坚持零容忍政策的国家，这些政策在过去十年中未能产生任何重大和持续的成果。这种日益缺乏共识的情况使麻管局及其秘书处在联合国毒品管制框架中处于越来越重要的位置。作为毒品管制条约的监督机构，麻管局必须尊重并敏感地对待成员国对条约解释的日益加深的分歧。在这份倡议说明中，IDPC指出了希望提请新任秘书长关注的关键问题领域。这些问题包括：麻管局对成员国替代性毒品政策选择缺乏客观性，拒绝鼓励麻管局、成员国、相关联合国机构、民间社会和非政府组织之间就毒品政策进行开放和建设性的辩论；麻管局在毒品政策工作中需要采取平衡的方法；麻管局成员需要更多样化的专业知识；麻管局运作缺乏透明度；需要加强与民间社会的接触，以确保麻管局职能的履行；以及需要采取更积极的态度，监督麻管局在其授权范围内的运作，并鼓励根据既定的联合国做法对其角色进行现代化改造。","international policy, INCB",2011-08-15

However, despite what has turned out to be only a hiatus in the Ghodse-Emafo dynasty (Hamed Ghodse re-assumed the Chairmanship in May 2010), the Report also displays a certain continuity of approach in terms of its more worrying content. Although at points perhaps more conciliatory in tone than in previous years, the document reveals the Board as a body that maintains a very narrow and selective interpretation of the drug control conventions. Within this context it remains keen to censure what it regards as moves towards the liberalization of policy practice, yet stays silent on other areas that are worthy of attention; particularly those relating to the non-punitive aspects of the conventions.

As such, it was eagerly anticipated for not only what it would say about the trends in world drug markets, but also what it might reveal about the outlook of the senior management of the Office itself after the UNGASS review. In this response to Report the IDPC welcomes improvements in the way in which sections of the Office have moved to approach the complex problem of presenting and interpreting data on global illicit drug markets as well as the associated increase in transparency surrounding working methodologies. The response, however, also highlights that the increased sophistication of the discussion of trends in world drug markets making up the bulk of the Report were not matched by the arguments put forward in the Executive Director’s Preface.  As a result, the World Drug Report 2009 can be viewed in many ways as a fractured discourse containing both welcome improvements and alarming developments. This brief review explores three key themes raised by an analysis of the document: the Executive Director’s Preface; a new approach towards the presentation of data; and the unintended consequences of the international drug control system.",《2009年世界毒品报告》是联合国毒品和犯罪问题办公室自麻醉药品委员会第五十二届会议高级别会议后发布的首份重要出版物。因此，人们不仅期待其揭示全球毒品市场趋势，更关注其中可能反映的联合国大会特别会议审议后该办公室高层管理者的政策取向。国际毒品政策联盟在对本报告的回应中，赞赏了该办公室部分部门在处理全球非法毒品市场数据呈现与解读这一复杂问题时的改进举措，以及相关工作方法透明度的提升。但回应同时指出，报告主体部分对全球毒品市场趋势的精细分析，与执行主任前言中提出的论点存在明显落差。这使得《2009年世界毒品报告》在某种程度上呈现出一种割裂的叙事——既包含可喜进步，又显露令人担忧的动向。本短评通过文件分析聚焦三个关键议题：执行主任前言、数据呈现的新方法，以及国际毒品管制体系的意外后果。,"International policy, World, UNODC",2011-08-16

The critics of such conditionality, known as linkage, are right to be concerned about its possible adverse effects. However, linkage can be desirable.  A set of rules for international trade that incorporates linkage can serve the interests of developing countries, and in particular of less advantaged individuals within them - if it is un-imposed, transparent and rule-based, applied in a manner reflecting a country's level of development, demands adequate international burden-sharing, and incorporates measures that ensure that appropriate account is taken of different viewpoints within each country. Such a linkage system could substantially reduce the costs that are incurred by exporting countries when they attempt to promote the interests of workers. By enabling and encouraging countries to promote labor standards, an appropriate form of linkage can serve as a cornerstone of a worker-oriented world trading system.",是否应将某些从事国际贸易的权利与促进劳工标准挂钩？反对这种挂钩条件的批评者对其可能带来的负面影响表示担忧是正确的。然而，挂钩机制也可能具有积极意义。一套包含挂钩机制且符合以下条件的国际贸易规则，可以服务于发展中国家的利益，尤其是其中处于弱势地位的群体——只要这种机制非强制实施、透明且基于规则，应用时能反映国家发展水平，要求合理的国际责任分担，并包含确保充分考虑各国国内不同观点的措施。这样的挂钩体系能显著降低出口国在试图维护工人权益时产生的成本。通过赋能并鼓励各国提升劳工标准，恰当的挂钩形式可成为以工人为核心的世界贸易体系的基石。,"linkage, labor standards, international trade, WTO",2008-06-16

international standards,InternationalTechnicalStandardsand Essential Patents: FromInternationalHarmonization to Competition of Technologies,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1632567,Branislav Hazucha,"The use of international technical standards and conformity assessment systems are conventionally deemed as facilitating international trade and improving efficiency of production worldwide. However, many national, regional as well as international technical standards often incorporate proprietary technologies which then become essential for their implementation. To dismantle non-tariff barriers to the international trade, the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) requires the WTO members to use international standards as a basis for their national technical regulations and standards. The duty also applies to the international standards which incorporate proprietary technologies. As international standards for high technologies heavily rely on proprietary technologies controlled mainly by companies established in developed countries, the duty under the TBT Agreement regularly brings clashes between developed countries and newly industrialized countries. Although it is generally recognized that it is important to protect the results of research and development (R&D) by the intellectual property rights, many newly industrialized countries deem the duty to use such international standards under the WTO regime as unfair. The perception of unfairness is even magnified, when their companies have to pay considerable amounts of royalties to the foreign holders of essential patents under international standards. This Article scrutinizes experiences with the national and international technical standards for several generations of mobile telephony in Europe, Far East Asia and the United States with the focus on the recent internationalization of standard-setting process in this field, geographical distribution of essential patents under individual standards, and the development of intellectual property rights policies applicable to standard-setting processes for mobile telephony on the national, regional and international levels. The Article points out that the outcome of international standardization should not be an adoption of any single international standard. Conversely, the TBT Agreement should create an environment where several technical solutions can compete on the global market. The competition between several technologies is one of precondition for guaranteeing the further technological progress in a sustainable way.

international standards,Financial Market Consequences of Early Adoption ofInternationalStandardson Auditing:InternationalEvidence,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3768152,Ibrahim Elmghaamez,"Purpose: This paper investigates the effects of the early adoption of International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) on Financial Market Indicators (FMIs) from a Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory perspective.Design/methodology/approach: Using panel data from 110 countries in a period that spans from 1995 to 2014, this study applies an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model to investigate the financial consequences of adopting ISAs. This analysis was supplemented with estimating a fixed-effects and two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression models in order to address any concerns regarding the possible existence of endogeneity problems.Findings: This study reports three key findings. First, we find that early ISAs adoption has a negative effect on several financial market consequences, namely stock market integration, market capitalisation, market turnover, market return, market development, stock price volatility, and stock trading volume. Second, using an alternative measure to the one that is proposed by DOI theory, we found that some financial indicators have been significantly improved after ISAs adoption, but only for listed firms that prepared their financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and audited by ISAs simultaneously. Finally, the financial indicators of European stock markets, however, have insignificantly shrank post the mandatory adoption of ISAs in 2006.Practical implications: Our empirical evidence raises questions about how ISAs were enforced and implemented. For example, countries that adopted ISAs at early stages may have been dominated mostly by recently established stock exchanges. This implies a crucial need to determine and apply the best type of auditing regime that can increase investors trust and enhance the credibility of stock markets information, which might ultimately advance the FMIs over time significantly.Originality/value: To-date, studies investigating the impact of the adoption of ISAs on FMI from a DOI theory perspective are virtually non-existent. Our study, therefore, seeks to contribute to the extant literature by examining the influence of ISAs adoption on a wide range of financial market indicators.",目的：本文从创新扩散理论（DOI）视角出发，探讨早期采用国际审计准则（ISAs）对金融市场指标（FMIs）的影响。  . 设计/方法/路径：本研究利用1995至2014年间110个国家的面板数据，采用普通最小二乘法（OLS）回归模型分析采用ISAs的财务影响，并辅以固定效应模型和两阶段最小二乘法（2SLS）回归模型，以解决潜在的内生性问题。  . 研究发现：本研究得出三个关键结论。首先，早期采用ISAs对多项金融市场指标产生负面影响，包括股市整合度、市值规模、市场周转率、市场回报率、市场发展水平、股价波动性和股票交易量。其次，采用与DOI理论不同的替代测量方法后发现，部分财务指标在采用ISAs后显著改善，但仅限那些同时遵循国际财务报告准则（IFRS）编制财报并由ISAs审计的上市公司。最后，2006年欧洲股市强制采用ISAs后，其财务指标并未出现显著萎缩。  . 实践意义：实证证据引发对ISAs执行与实施方式的反思。早期采用ISAs的国家可能主要由新成立的证券交易所主导，这凸显出亟需确立最佳审计制度以提升投资者信任、增强股市信息可信度，从而显著改善长期金融市场指标。  . 原创性/价值：目前从DOI理论视角探究ISAs采用对FMI影响的研究几乎空白。本研究通过考察ISAs对广泛金融市场指标的影响，为现有文献提供了新见解。,"International Standards on Auditing, Financial Market Indicators, Financial Consequences, Diffusion of Innovation Theory, Stock Market.",2021-02-18

international standards,Comparative InterpretationStandardsin UniformInternationalLaw,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3358800,Maren Heidemann,"This paper offers a horizontal comparison of integrated interpretation norms in uniform law conventions such as the Vienna Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG), the UNCITRAL Model Laws and the older Hague Convention relating to a Uniform Law on the International Sale of Goods, (ULIS),  as well as in Double Taxation Conventions (DTCS) and in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT). It shows how interpretation standards have evolved in uniform law over the past decades, how they can be enforced and what a desirable continuation of this process and a desirable interpetation standard will be. Interpretation standards are a crucial for the successful use and application of international law. They are contained partly in the individual rules themselves, partly in special international legislation on the matter such as the VCLT and partly in the law, customs and practices of the country or institution where the uniform law is applied. So, while uniform law is specifically made by supranational legislatures or institutions to address cross-border affairs such as private and commercial contracts and their performance, its practical usefulness and success depends on the way this law is interpreted on its application. Interpretation standards exist simultaneously within many uniform instruments as well as in national legal doctrine in most domestic jurisdictions. From this simultaneous presence of potentially differing standards conflicts can arise. Domestic legal positions are often given preference over the intended solutions of the international legal instrument, indicating a weak position of the international law.  Thereby, the true purposes of any specialised uniform law cannot be realised and the international transaction lacks the legal protection that it was awarded by an international rule maker by way of the relevant international legal instrument. The present paper shows how this legal protection can be realised through the use of interpetation standards.",本文对《联合国国际货物销售合同公约》(CISG)、《贸易法委员会示范法》及早期《国际货物买卖统一法海牙公约》(ULIS)等统一法公约，以及《双重征税协定》(DTCS)和《维也纳条约法公约》(VCLT)中的综合解释规范进行了横向比较。研究展示了统一法领域解释标准过去数十年的演变历程、其实施路径，以及该进程理想的发展方向与理想的解释标准应具备的特征。解释标准对国际法的成功运用和实施至关重要，其来源包括具体规则本身、《维也纳条约法公约》等专门国际立法，以及适用统一法的国家或机构的法律、惯例与实践。虽然统一法由超国家立法机构或国际组织专门制定以处理跨境事务（如私人与商业合同及其履行），但其实际效用与成功取决于法律适用时的解释方式。解释标准同时存在于诸多统一法律文书与多数国内法域的法律学说中，这种潜在差异标准的同时存在可能引发冲突。国内法律立场常优先于国际法律文书的既定解决方案，反映出国际法的弱势地位。这导致任何专门统一法的真实目的均无法实现，国际交易也丧失了国际规则制定者通过相关法律文书赋予的法律保护。本文阐述了如何通过运用解释标准来实现这种法律保护。,"Uniform Law, Interpretation Standards, Autonomous Interpretation Mathod, Double Taxation Conventions, Vienna Convention of the Law of Treaties, Vienna Sales Convention, Uncitrals Model Laws",2019-04-24

international standards,"Ruminations on the Past, Present and Future ofInternationalLaborStandards: Empowering Law in the Brave New Economic World",https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1316463,Marley S. Weiss,"International labor standards are among the oldest international standards pertaining to the conduct of private, as well as public, economic actors.  Far from being settled, however, nearly every aspect of the current international labor standards regime is in flux:  the role of labor standards in the international legal, economic, political, and social order, as well as in the parallel domestic orders; the modes by which standards are brought into being; the manner and means of their implementation and enforcement; the degree to which they may be binding solely on nation-state parties, and enforceable only at their behest; and the extent to which private actors, such as employer associations, trade union associations, worker rights non-governmental organizations, and individuals, play roles in the creation and enforcement of international labor norms.  Although the substantive content of international labor standards is changing at a far less blistering pace, important alterations in priorities for these standards also gradually are becoming manifest. This article sketches out the historical trajectory of transformation in the manner and means, participants and roles involved in creation, implementation and enforcement of international labor standards, as well as their content.  It concludes with some speculative remarks about their future.  The future of international labor standards may be more formal standards, covering fewer and fewer countries, companies and workers, posing ever greater obstacles to turning the law on the books into workers' reality in fact.  On the other hand, innovative trade union and worker organizations are combining across boundaries to push the limits of transnational labor cooperation, pooling their economic and political power to improve each other's collective bargaining power.  In the longer term, at least some of the workers of the world may unite, combining their shared collective leverage with the moral suasion of international norms, to make a reality of international labor standards.",国际劳工标准是最早涉及私营和公共经济行为体行为的国际标准之一。然而，当前国际劳工标准体系的几乎每个方面都远未定型，仍处于变动之中：劳工标准在国际法律、经济、政治、社会秩序及相应国内秩序中的作用；标准产生的模式；其实施和执行的方式与手段；它们可能仅对民族国家具有约束力并仅在其授权下执行的程度；以及雇主协会、工会协会、工人权利非政府组织和个人等私营行为体在创建和执行国际劳工规范中所扮演的角色。尽管国际劳工标准的实质性内容变化速度远没有那么迅猛，但这些标准的优先事项也在逐渐发生重要变化。本文概述了国际劳工标准在创建、实施和执行的方式与手段、参与者及角色以及内容方面的历史演变轨迹。文章最后对其未来进行了一些推测性评论。国际劳工标准的未来可能是形式更加规范，但覆盖的国家、公司和工人越来越少，将书面法律转化为工人实际权益的障碍越来越大。另一方面，创新的工会和工人组织正在跨国界联合起来，推动跨国劳工合作的极限，汇集他们的经济和政治力量，以增强彼此的集体谈判能力。从长远来看，至少世界上部分工人可能会联合起来，将他们共同的集体影响力与国际规范的道德劝勉相结合，使国际劳工标准成为现实。,international labor standards,2008-12-17

IAS are a set of financial reporting policies that typically require increased disclosure and restrict management's choices of measurement methods relative to the accounting standards of our sample firms' countries of domicile. We develop indexes of differences in countries' accounting disclosure and measurement policies relative to IAS, and document that greater differences in accounting standards relative to IAS are significantly and positively associated with the absolute value of analyst earnings forecast errors. Further, we show that analyst forecast accuracy improves after firms adopt IAS. More specifically, after controlling for changes in the market value of equity, changes in analyst following, and changes in the number of news reports, we find that the convergence in firms' accounting policies brought about by adopting IAS is positively associated with the reduction in analyst forecast errors.",我们研究（1）各国会计准则与国际会计准则（IAS）之间的差异是否会影响财务分析师准确预测非美国企业盈利的能力，以及（2）企业采用IAS后分析师预测准确性是否发生变化。IAS是一套财务报告政策，相较于样本企业所在国的会计准则，通常要求增加披露并限制管理层对计量方法的选择。我们构建了各国会计披露和计量政策与IAS差异的指数，并证明会计准则与IAS的较大差异与分析师盈利预测误差绝对值呈显著正相关。此外，我们发现企业采用IAS后分析师预测准确性有所提高。更具体地说，在控制股权市值变化、分析师跟踪数量变化和新闻报道数量变化后，我们发现企业采用IAS带来的会计政策趋同与分析师预测误差的减少呈正相关。,"International Accounting Standards, IAS, Analyst Earnings Forecasts",2001-05-19

international standards,The EU Sustainable Finance Framework in Light ofInternationalStandards,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3984511,Dirk A. Zetzsche,"This paper analyses the relationship between the EU sustainable finance legal framework (‘EU SF framework’) and the most common ESG standards. We present two different types of analysis. Firstly, we analyze the content of the international standards incorporated by reference in the EU SF framework following the classical ESG categorization, and secondly we analyze the content of such standards with the EU SF framework.We find that the different standards incorporated in the EU SF framework partly overlap, while somehow diverging as to the details. This overlap will create frictions, given that financial service providers need to decide which of the overlapping, yet partly diverging standards they apply.The EU environmental taxonomy presents unique features and a higher level of sophistication when compared to international ESG standards. This may result in both upsides and downsides. On the upside, the EU SF framework could function as pacemaker and facilitate impact measurement across the industry, while on the downside we see additional costs for EU firms and political resistance against the overly detailed EU approach. At the same time, the EU SF framework lacks details on the social and governance dimensions of ESG. Here, reference to international standards compensates the lack of an EU social and governance taxonomy. While this allows for greater alignment of EU and international social and governance-oriented investors, a greater degree of sophistication at the EU level could enhance the potential for impact measurement – a particularly important aspect for socially sustainable investments.",本文分析了欧盟可持续金融法律框架（“欧盟SF框架”）与最常见ESG标准之间的关系。我们呈现了两种不同类型的分析：首先，我们按照传统ESG分类法分析了欧盟SF框架通过引用方式纳入的国际标准内容；其次，我们结合欧盟SF框架对这些标准内容进行了分析。研究发现，欧盟SF框架纳入的不同标准存在部分重叠，但在细节上存在一定差异。这种重叠将产生摩擦，因为金融服务提供商需要决定采用哪些相互重叠却又部分分歧的标准。与国际ESG标准相比，欧盟环境分类体系具有独特特征和更高复杂度。这可能带来双重影响：积极方面在于欧盟SF框架可发挥引领作用，促进行业影响衡量；消极方面则体现为欧盟企业将承担额外成本，且可能引发对欧盟过度细化方法的政治阻力。同时，欧盟SF框架在社会和治理维度的ESG内容上缺乏细节。此处对国际标准的引用弥补了欧盟在社会和治理分类体系上的缺失。虽然这有助于欧盟与国际社会和治理导向投资者的协调，但若欧盟层面能提升相关标准的精细度，将增强影响衡量的潜力——这对社会可持续投资尤为重要。,"Sustainable Finance, Taxonomy, Financial Regulation, International Standards, ESG",2022-02-11

This study provides global empirical evidence on first-order determinants of audit quality by examining whether and how convergence affects audit quality through utilizing data on 41 jurisdictions and employing a staggered difference-indifferences approach. We find that ISA convergence leads to higher audit quality on average. The positive effect is stronger for clients of domestic audit firms, in jurisdictions with stronger enforcement, and when the ISA convergence level is higher. Insights from textual features suggest that changes in principle-orientation, comparability, readability, and size (or length) of auditing standards are positively related to audit quality. Exploratory analyses of textual content using machine learning reveal that the emphases of ISA on going-concern assessment and legal compliance, fraud-risk assessment and internal-control evaluation, and related-party transactions and subsequent events contribute to enhanced audit quality.",许多国家已将其国内审计准则与国际审计准则（ISA）趋同。本研究通过利用41个司法管辖区的数据并采用交错双重差分法，探讨了趋同是否及如何影响审计质量，从而为审计质量的一阶决定因素提供了全球性实证证据。我们发现，ISA趋同平均而言会提高审计质量。这种积极影响在国内审计事务所的客户中、在执法力度更强的司法管辖区以及ISA趋同程度更高时更为显著。文本特征分析表明，审计准则的原则导向性、可比性、可读性及规模（或长度）的变化与审计质量呈正相关。通过机器学习对文本内容进行的探索性分析揭示，ISA对持续经营评估与法律合规、舞弊风险评估与内部控制评价，以及关联方交易和期后事项的强调有助于提升审计质量。,"International Standards on Auditing, Audit Quality, Audit Firms, Enforcement, Auditing Standards International Standards on Auditing, Audit Quality, Audit Firms, Enforcement, Auditing Standards",2024-10-09
international standards,Standardsfor Corporate Financial Reporting: Regulatory Competition within and AcrossInternationalBoundaries,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=290599,Shyam Sunder,"Most financial reporting jurisdictions across the world allow a local monopoly in financial reporting standards for publicly held corporations. In the U.S., for example, the statutory authority over these standards is vested in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), who delegates the task of writing standards to the Financial Accounting Standards Board, retaining an oversight function for itself. In some countries these standards are specified through statutes in varying levels of detail. Few countries permit their corporations to choose among two or more sets of competing standards; monopoly is the reigning norm.     This paper examines regulatory competition as a model for writing and implementing corporate financial standards. Under this model, two or more approved standard setting bodies are allowed to compete for the allegiance of the reporting entities. Each corporation can choose which of the two or more sets of competing standards it wishes to use in preparing its financial reports.  Corporations must choose an entire set of standards in toto, and clearly mark the reports with the set of standards used to prepare them. We examine the consequences of such regulatory competition for the quality and efficiency of standards, quality of information provided to shareholders and other interested parties, and the efficiency of corporate governance and managerial actions.  A debate on the merits of monopoly versus competitive standards may help direct the formation of national and international regimes for setting accounting standards.",全球大多数财务报告管辖区允许上市公司在财务报告准则方面实行地方垄断。例如在美国，这些准则的法定权力归属于证券交易委员会（SEC），该机构将制定准则的任务委托给财务会计准则委员会，同时保留自身的监督职能。在某些国家，这些准则通过法律以不同详细程度予以规定。鲜有国家允许企业从两套或多套竞争性准则中自主选择；垄断是普遍现象。. . 本文探讨以监管竞争作为制定和实施公司财务准则的模式。该模式下，两个或多个经批准的准则制定机构可竞争获取报告实体的遵循权。每家企业可自主选择其编制财务报告时希望采用的竞争性准则体系。企业必须完整选用整套准则，并在报告中明确标注所采用的准则体系。我们分析了此类监管竞争对准则质量与效率、向股东及其他利益相关方提供的信息质量，以及公司治理和管理层决策效率的影响。关于垄断准则与竞争性准则优劣的辩论，或可为国家和国际层面会计准则体系的构建提供方向指引。,"Accounting Standards, Regulatory Competition, International",2001-11-27

international standards,Guide to theInternationalFinancial Statistics,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1187984,Bank for International Settlements,"The origins of BIS activities in the field of international financial statistics go back to the mid-1960s and the emergence of the so-called eurocurrency markets that had sprung up to circumvent domestic regulations. At that time the key policy concern that gave rise to the joint data collection exercise by the central banks of the G10 countries under the aegis of the BIS was the need to monitor the rapid growth of these markets and its possible monetary implications. This led to the introduction of reporting by internationally active banks of their international positions in major individual currencies, with a geographical and partial sectoral breakdown. On the basis of these reports the central banks and the BIS compiled the so-called locational banking statistics for various lending and borrowing countries. In the subsequent years, the issue of recycling the current account surpluses of oil-producing countries shifted the emphasis in favour of a more detailed geographical breakdown and of flow data. In the context of the deregulation of domestic financial systems and capital flows in the 1970s and 1980s these concerns abated, but in their place came others, notably the rise in the indebtedness of many developing countries to international banks in the early 1980s. This build-up was visible in the existing locational banking statistics collected and published by the BIS, but it was not possible to evaluate in a comprehensive way the risk characteristics of the exposures of national banking systems to individual borrowing countries. The need for such information therefore led to the reporting of a second set of international banking data on a fully consolidated basis. A maturity breakdown of the consolidated banking claims was also introduced at that time. In response to calls for more up-to-date information on the international lending activities of banks, the BIS began in the early 1990s to collect and publish data on signed syndicated credit facilities. More recently, with the objective of enhancing the analysis of country risk exposures, efforts have been made to achieve a more complete and detailed reporting of consolidated banking data on an ultimate risk basis, including off-balance sheet positions relating to bank's derivatives transactions. As a result of the increasing role of the international securities markets in global financial intermediation, the BIS was mandated in the mid-1980s to collect and publish statistics on these markets on the basis of data from commercial databases and information available to individual central banks. In the 1990s the BIS also became increasingly involved in the coordination of joint surveys that central banks carried out on a regular basis to monitor activity in global foreign exchange markets. Moreover, as derivatives markets expanded in the wake of financial innovation, central banks asked the BIS to collect and publish international data on exchange-traded and over-the-counter derivatives transactions. The development of the BIS international financial statistics thus reflects evolving central bank concerns relating to monetary and financial stability in the context of worldwide financial market deregulation, innovation and globalisation. In addition to their use for policy-related monitoring purposes by central banks, the international financial statistics have meanwhile proved to be of interest to private sector market participants. The latter have come to recognise the unique value of the BIS data for tracking the borrowing by emerging market countries from the international banking and securities markets. The BIS data are also used by the IMF in the compilation of its international financial statistics and in its surveillance of individual economies. Moreover, the BIS data have proved to be useful for improving balance of payment statistics and for measuring and monitoring developing countries' foreign debt. With respect to the latter, following the 1997 Asian debt crisis the IMF, OECD, World Bank and BIS pooled their respective statistics to collectively publish data from creditor and market sources on countries' foreign indebtedness. Apart from providing insights into the geographical distributions of international financial flows and external vulnerabilities and risk exposures of debtors and creditors, the international financial statistics collected and disseminated by the BIS contain important information on the structural developments in international financial markets. They can be used, for instance, to analyse the importance of individual financial centres (including so-called offshore centres), the emergence of new relationships between financial and non-financial firms, the level and concentration of activity in financial markets as well as spillovers between different market segments. Much of this is not easily available elsewhere. The statistics become even more valuable when they are combined with other sources covering financial asset prices, market liquidity and trading patterns, external ratings, and the activity of non-bank financial firms and non-financial companies. They then allow market participants and policymakers to make an assessment of credit and liquidity risks in domestic and international financial markets as well as of potential vulnerabilities to systemic disturbances in these markets. The usefulness of the international financial statistics is, of course, potentially affected by the fact that the boundaries between international and domestic markets are becoming more blurred. This could, on the one hand, constitute a weakness of the statistics as it may become increasingly difficult to define and distinguish pure international financial market activity from that in domestic markets. On the other hand, as this guide explains and illustrates, the methodology of the international statistics has tried to keep pace with such developments and to ensure that financial analysts are aware of the limitations of the statistics. Moreover, given that financial innovations have often started in the competitive environment of the international financial markets and that market sentiments are becoming increasingly correlated internationally, the BIS statistics have been and continue to be a very useful tool to capture structural and market developments in global markets at an early stage. The BIS, and the central banking community working through it, have also taken steps to complement the publication of the international financial statistics with a selection of highlights and analyses of major market trends. In the case of the BIS this applies to the press releases accompanying the release of new data; to the BIS Quarterly Review, which contains more in-depth analysis of specific issues, and to its Annual Report, which analyses long-term trends and emerging policy issues. The statistics are also mentioned and explained regularly in presentations by senior BIS officials to central banks, market participants and academics. Other initiatives to promote the use of the statistics include making them available in electronic form on the BIS website and updating the guidelines and methodological notes on a regular basis. Work on collecting, compiling and disseminating the BIS international financial statistics is closely related to, and guided by, the activities of the various Basel-based committees and expert groups as well as those of other international institutions. The Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) plays a key role in reaching a consensus on priorities to improve the BIS statistics. With respect to international banking data, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) is consulted on methodological issues to help ensure the collection of adequate statistical information from internationally active banks on risk exposures. The Financial Stability Forum (FSF) has also formulated a number of recommendations to enhance statistics on international financial markets and capital flows that are taken into account by the BIS in its statistical work. As a result of the strong support of these groups it has been possible to improve on the reporting frequency and timeliness of the international financial statistics in recent years. One of the major underlying objectives of the various Basel-based groups is to strengthen financial stability through transparency and market discipline. Increased public disclosure plays a key role in this and should, over time, lead to better quantitative and qualitative information on the activities and risk profiles of individual institutions as well as market infrastructures such as payment, settlement and trading systems. With respect to the functioning of domestic and international financial markets, various proposals have been made to complement the BIS statistics on banking, securities, foreign exchange and derivatives markets over time by improved aggregate information on liquidity, leverage and position-taking in these markets. More recently the IMF has been elaborating a methodology for the collection by individual countries of comprehensive financial soundness indicators, which should complement the BIS statistics. The disclosure framework on the exposures and capital structure of internationally active banks proposed under the New Basel Capital Accord (its so-called Pillar III) should contribute to better balance sheet data of individual internationally active banks. This Guide is structured around the three main areas of the BIS international financial statistics: the international banking statistics (Part II); the securities statistics (Part III); and the derivatives and foreign exchange statistics (Parts IV and V). It also provides a description of the joint BIS-IMF-OECD-World Bank statistics on external debt for which the BIS is a main contributor of data (Part VI). The guide provides a detailed description of the sources, compilation, transformation and publication of the data. Two separate chapters on the quality and the uses of the statistics (Parts VII and VIII) follow the description of the statistics. A more detailed description of the BIS international banking statistics and their underlying methodology is provided in a separate guide. This Guide has been prepared by Paul Van den Bergh, Rainer Widera, Karsten von Kleist, Jesper Wormstrup and others in the Monetary and Economic Department of the BIS. Chapter VIII draws largely on an article by Philip Wooldridge. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Methodologies for data collection and compilation have been developed to enable reporting of these statistics by the end of 2004. 2 In the late 1980s an exercise took place to explain and correct the errors and omissions in the global balance of payments statistics. Given the consistency of the BIS banking data, these data played a key role in this exercise. Various countries use the data on an ongoing basis to improve their national balance of payment statistics (see also Chapter VIII). 3 In many cases debt to foreign banks, as recorded in the BIS statistics, is a large component of external debt. Moreover, the BIS statistics provide information on the short-term component of a country's foreign debt to international banks and to holders of international securities (ie with a residual maturity of less than one year). 4 An international initiative is currently under way by the BIS, IMF, ECB, Eurostat and the UN to develop standards and best practices for the exchange and dissemination of statistical data and metadata (for the so-called sdmx initiative see www.sdmx.org). This should facilitate the dissemination of the BIS international financial statistics and make it easier for users to search and retrieve the data in a user-friendly form. 5 The financial soundness indicators would provide an aggregated balance sheet for the banking system in individual countries. This would include balance sheet items covering banks' domestic activities, various types of risk exposures and some details on banks' capital structure. 6 See BIS (2000). 7 See Wooldridge (2002).","国际清算银行在国际金融统计领域的活动可追溯至20世纪60年代中期，当时为规避国内监管而兴起的欧洲货币市场开始崭露头角。彼时，促使十国集团央行在BIS框架下开展联合数据收集工作的核心政策关切，是监测这些市场的快速扩张及其潜在的货币影响。由此催生了国际活跃银行按主要币种申报其国际头寸的制度，并附有地理维度和部分行业分类。基于这些报告，各国央行与BIS编制了针对不同借贷国家的""区位银行统计""。. . 随后数年，石油输出国经常账户盈余的再循环问题促使统计重点转向更精细的地理分类和流量数据。随着20世纪七八十年代各国金融体系与资本流动的放松管制，相关担忧有所缓解，但新的焦点随之浮现——特别是80年代初许多发展中国家对国际银行债务的激增。这一趋势在BIS既有的区位银行统计中已有显现，但当时无法全面评估各国银行体系对单一借款国的风险敞口特征。这一需求催生了第二套基于完全并表原则的国际银行业数据申报体系，同期还引入了并表银行债权的期限分类。. . 为响应市场对银行国际信贷活动时效性数据的需求，BIS于90年代初开始收集并发布银团贷款签约数据。近年来，为加强国家风险敞口分析，BIS着力推动基于最终风险原则的并表银行数据申报，涵盖银行衍生品交易等表外头寸。随着国际证券市场在全球金融中介中的作用日益凸显，BIS于80年代中期受命基于商业数据库和各国央行信息编制证券市场统计。90年代起，BIS还深度参与协调各国央行定期开展的全球外汇市场联合调查。金融创新浪潮下衍生品市场扩张之际，央行们又委托BIS收集发布交易所与场外衍生品交易的国际数据。. . BIS国际金融统计的发展历程，映射出全球金融市场放松管制、创新与全球化背景下，央行对货币金融稳定问题的持续演进。这些统计不仅服务于央行的政策监测，亦被私营部门市场参与者视为追踪新兴市场国家从国际银行与证券市场融资的独特工具。IMF亦将其纳入国际金融统计编制及国别经济监督。BIS数据对改进国际收支统计、监测发展中国家外债同样成效显著——1997年亚洲债务危机后，IMF、OECD、世行与BIS整合多方信源，联合发布国家外债数据。. . 除揭示国际资金流动的地理分布与主客体的外部脆弱性外，BIS统计还蕴含国际金融市场结构演变的关键信息，可用于分析金融中心地位、金融与非金融企业的新型关联、市场活动集中度及跨市场溢出效应等独特维度。当结合资产价格、流动性指标、外部评级等数据时，其更能帮助评估国内外市场的信用与流动性风险及系统性扰动隐患。. . 当然，随着境内外市场界限日益模糊，统计的界定难度可能影响其有效性。但正如本指南阐释的，BIS方法论始终与时俱进，并明确提示分析边界。鉴于金融创新往往发轫于国际市场竞争环境，且市场情绪全球化关联加深，BIS统计始终是捕捉全球市场早期结构性变化的有效工具。BIS与央行界还通过发布重点摘要、市场趋势分析（如季度报告、年报）及高层演讲阐释等方式增强统计可读性，并通过电子化发布、定期更新指南等措施提升可用性。. . BIS统计工作与巴塞尔各委员会及国际组织的活动紧密联动：全球金融体系委员会（CGFS）主导统计改进的优先级共识，巴塞尔银行监管委员会（BCBS）就银行风险敞口统计的方法论提供咨询，金融稳定论坛（FSF）提出的国际金融市场统计强化建议亦被纳入考量。这些支持使得近年统计发布的频率与时效显著提升。各巴塞尔组织的核心目标是通过透明度与市场纪律强化金融稳定，其中加强公开披露是关键路径——新巴塞尔资本协议第三支柱关于国际活跃银行风险敞口与资本结构的披露框架，将显著改善银行资产负债表数据的质量。. . 本指南按BIS国际金融统计三大板块展开：国际银行业统计（第二部分）、证券统计（第三部分）、衍生品与外汇统计（第四、五部分），并专章说明BIS作为主要数据提供方的BIS-IMF-OECD-世行联合外债统计（第六部分）。除详述数据来源、编制流程与发布机制外，另设统计质量（第七部分）与应用（第八部分）独立章节。更详尽的国际银行业统计方法说明见单独指南。. . 本指南由BIS货币经济部的Paul Van den Bergh、Rainer Widera、Karsten von Kleist、Jesper Wormstrup等专家编撰，第八章主要援引Philip Wooldridge的论述。统计方法论设计确保2004年底前可实现数据报送。80年代末全球国际收支统计纠错工作中，BIS银行数据因其一致性发挥关键作用，多国持续沿用该数据改进本国国际收支统计。BIS统计中的银行外债常构成国家外债主要部分，且能提供短期外债（剩余期限不足一年）的细分数据。目前BIS正与IMF、ECB等机构推进统计数据交换标准的国际化倡议（sdmx），以优化数据传播效率。金融稳健指标将补充银行体系并表数据，新巴塞尔协议第三支柱披露框架则将提升单家银行的资产负债表透明度。",,2008-07-30
international standards,Use ofInternationalAccounting and Financial ReportingStandardsin Enterprise Management,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3631031,M.  Kotsupatriy,"The subject of the research is a set of theoretical, methodological, organizational and practical bases for the formation of financial statements of enterprises in the context of its harmonization with international standards and management needs. The purpose of this work is to determine the advantages, functions and prospects of using international standards in accounting and financial reporting to improve enterprise management. The methodological basis of the article is both General scientific and special methods of scientific knowledge. Methods were used: dialectical, monographic, historical, system-structural analysis and synthesis, problem-and program-oriented approaches. The article defines the advantages, functions and prospects of using international standards in accounting and financial reporting to improve enterprise management. It is proved that the globalization of markets and the creation of a single international economic space actualizes the need to create in the enterprise management system such accounting, financial reporting and control, which would be built on the basis of the same principles and rules. It is determined that in modern conditions of activity management, international standards are an effective tool for increasing transparency and clarity of information that reveals the activities of business entities, creates a reliable basis for recognizing expenses, provides an opportunity to objectively disclose the financial risks of the enterprise and compare the results of activities. The conceptual framework provides that, depending on the legislation of the state in which the company operates, regulatory and additional reserves may be created as part of its own capital. The conclusions and results of the article can be used in the educational and scientific process of economic faculties of higher educational institutions. It is advisable to transfer them for practical use in enterprise management in order to increase its efficiency on innovative principles. It is important for the management of enterprises not only to use international standards in the organization of accounting and reporting, but also Notes to them. The notes to the annual financial statements should disclose the analysis of other comprehensive income by item, as well as information about the types of shares, indicating for each of them the par value, the amount of dividends recognized as payments to owners during this period, as well as the corresponding amount of dividends per share. In addition, it is necessary to detail the components of registered capital (the number of shares issued, indicating the amount paid, outstanding, and those withdrawn at the end of the reporting period). In order to obtain complete information for the management of enterprises, it is advisable to provide a description of each of the reserves created by the decision of the owners, with a definition of the documentary basis for its creation, as well as the purposes for which the reserve may be directed.",该研究的主题是一套关于企业在与国际标准和管理需求相协调背景下形成财务报表的理论、方法、组织和实践基础。本工作的目的是确定国际标准在会计和财务报告中的应用优势、功能及前景，以提升企业管理水平。文章的方法论基础包括一般科学方法和特殊科学认知方法，具体运用了辩证、专题研究、历史、系统结构分析与综合、问题导向及规划导向等方法。文章明确了国际标准在会计和财务报告中的优势、功能及对企业管理改进的前景，并证实了市场全球化及统一国际经济空间的形成为企业管理体系中建立基于相同原则和规则的会计、财务报告及控制体系提出了现实需求。研究指出，在现代经营管理条件下，国际标准是提高商业实体活动信息透明度和清晰度的有效工具，为费用确认创建可靠基础，客观揭示企业财务风险并实现经营成果可比性。概念框架表明，根据企业所在国法律，其所有者资本中可设立法定储备和附加储备。文章结论与成果可用于高校经济院系的教学与科研活动，并建议将其转化为企业管理的实践应用，以创新原则提升效率。企业管理层不仅需在会计与报告组织中应用国际标准，还需关注其附注信息。年度财务报表附注应披露其他综合收益分项分析、股份类型信息（包括面值、当期确认为所有者分配的股息金额及每股对应股息），并详细列示注册资本构成（已发行股份数量、实缴金额、未缴金额及报告期末回购股份）。为获取完整管理信息，建议描述所有者决议设立的各项储备，明确其设立文件依据及资金用途。,"management, system, enterprises, information, accounting, financial reporting, organization, international standards, improvements",2020-07-13
international standards,Development and Application ofInternationalFood SafetyStandards— Challenges and Opportunities,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2848964,Samuel Godefroy,"International food standards offer the opportunity to provide guidance in preventing and mitigating food safety risks, while enhancing convergence of food regulatory measures adopted around the globe. The Codex Alimentarius Commission has achieved tremendous progress in developing standards, guidance and codes of practice that address various food safety hazards. These standards have guided food regulators worldwide in shaping their food safety requirements for foods produced domestically or imported. Despite this progress, several challenges have been identified in relation with the application and implementation of Codex standards by domestic jurisdictions. Given that Codex standards tend to be outcome-based to ensure more flexibility and their possible adaptation to various scenarios encountered by food regulators and food industry operators around the world, operationalizing such measures can be challenging for the food sector and/or regulators in low and medium economy countries. Helping the implementation of Codex standards is therefore a key area of food safety capacity building efforts, recognized in the Strategic Plan of the Codex Alimentarius Commission 2014-19. International standards have also to remain relevant for Codex membership, if they are to serve members’ needs. Codex should therefore be able to adapt and address emerging issues resulting from changes in food safety and nutrition priorities, such as the expanding international trade in foods and food ingredients; the multiplication of free trade agreements at the bilateral and regional level where food and food products continue to be a centrepiece of most traded commodities; the requirements for resource optimisation in economically uncertain times and the importance of innovation to improve value-added of food products. This paper briefly reviews some accomplishments of Codex in the development of international food standards. It also attempts to identify areas of priority investments in capacity building initiatives aimed to propagate the use of these standards. It discusses synergies that can be found to optimize the use of resources and to enhance convergence of food safety regulatory measures, in support of consumers’ health protection and reduction of impediments to international trade.",国际食品标准为预防和减轻食品安全风险提供了指导，同时促进了全球范围内食品监管措施的协调一致。食品法典委员会在制定针对各类食品安全危害的标准、指南和操作规范方面取得了巨大进展。这些标准指导着世界各地的食品监管机构制定对国产或进口食品的安全要求。尽管取得了这些进展，但在国内司法管辖区应用和实施法典标准方面仍存在若干挑战。鉴于法典标准倾向于基于结果，以确保更大的灵活性，并能适应全球食品监管机构和食品行业经营者遇到的各种情况，对于中低收入国家的食品行业和/或监管机构来说，实施这些措施可能具有挑战性。因此，帮助实施法典标准是食品安全能力建设工作的一个关键领域，这一点在《2014-19年食品法典委员会战略计划》中得到了认可。国际标准若要满足成员国的需求，也必须与法典成员保持相关性。因此，法典应能够适应并解决因食品安全和营养优先事项变化而产生的新问题，例如食品和食品配料国际贸易的扩大；在双边和区域层面自由贸易协定的增多，其中食品和食品产品仍然是大多数贸易商品的核心；在经济不确定时期优化资源的需求，以及创新对提高食品附加值的重要性。本文简要回顾了法典在制定国际食品标准方面的一些成就，并试图确定旨在推广使用这些标准的能力建设倡议中的优先投资领域。本文还探讨了可以找到的协同效应，以优化资源利用，加强食品安全监管措施的协调一致，从而支持保护消费者健康和减少国际贸易障碍。,"food safety, risk management, international food standards, SPS requirements",2016-10-08
international standards,Rule-Based Trade 2.0? The Rise of Informal Rules andInternationalStandardsand How They May Outcompete WTO Treaties,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2474525,Joost Pauwelyn,"One of Professor Jackson’s many legacies is his role in moving the international trade system from a “power-oriented” to a “rule-oriented” regime. The core feature and underlying goal of a “rule-oriented structure”, Professor Jackson explains, is “creating greater predictability, redressing unfair power imbalances, and preventing escalating international tensions”. The focus of “rule-based trade 1.0” is, therefore, on output and effect (predictability and stability of rules; their neutral application to all), not on input and content of the rules in the first place (who defines the rules, how were they adopted, are the rules welfare enhancing, coherent and adapted to new developments?).  This contribution highlights how, since the turn of the millennium, we have witnessed stagnation in the formation of traditional treaty rules combined with a rise in informal rules and international standards.  While the nature of the rules is thereby changing profoundly -- new actors, new processes, new outputs -- the contribution’s main claim is that the output and effect of the new type of rules being created (e.g. their effectiveness) may well match, and at times outcompete, that of traditional GATT/WTO rules.  At the same time, these new (informal) rules and standards may also be more (rather than less) legitimate and coherent in terms of input and content.  This potential evolution is described as a move from “thin state consent” (rule-based trade 1.0) to “thick stakeholder consensus” (rule-based trade 2.0).",杰克逊教授的众多遗产之一，是他在推动国际贸易体系从“权力导向”转向“规则导向”方面所发挥的作用。他解释道，“规则导向结构”的核心特征和根本目标是“增强可预测性、纠正不公平的权力失衡，并防止国际紧张局势升级”。因此，“基于规则的贸易1.0”的重点在于规则的产出和效果（规则的可预测性和稳定性；对所有成员的中立适用），而非首先关注规则的制定过程和内容（谁制定规则、规则如何通过、规则是否提升福利、是否连贯并适应新发展？）。本文着重指出，自世纪之交以来，我们见证了传统条约规则形成的停滞与非正式规则和国际标准的兴起。尽管规则的性质因此发生了深刻变化——新参与者、新流程、新产出——但本文的核心论点是，新型规则的产出和效果（例如其有效性）很可能与传统GATT/WTO规则不相上下，有时甚至更胜一筹。与此同时，这些新的（非正式）规则和标准在制定过程和内容方面也可能更具（而非更少）合法性和连贯性。这种潜在的演变被描述为从“浅层国家同意”（基于规则的贸易1.0）向“深层利益相关方共识”（基于规则的贸易2.0）的转变。,"WTO, rule-based trade, informal law, rule of law, international standards, soft law",2014-08-01

This 80 percent participation rate reaffirms the importance countries place on data transparency in the globalized economy, which the initiatives promote. The wide participation can be attributed to the consultative process that has allowed for the development of a coherent program that takes account of countries' capabilities, delineates clear responsibilities between the IMF and participating countries, and establishes effective monitoring procedures to ensure the credibility of the standards for policymakers, capital markets, and the general public. The approach has also provided checks and balances and fostered accountability.

international standards,InternationalTrade and LaborStandards: A Proposal for Linkage,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=799924,Christian Barry,"Should some rights to engage in international trade be made conditional on the promotion of labor standards?  The critics of such conditionality, known as linkage, are right to be concerned about its possible adverse effects. However, linkage can be desirable.  A set of rules for international trade that incorporates linkage can serve the interests of developing countries, and in particular of less advantaged individuals within them - if it is unimposed, transparent and rule-based, applied in a manner reflecting a country's level of development, demands adequate international burden-sharing, and incorporates measures that ensure that appropriate account is taken of different viewpoints within each country.   Such a linkage system could substantially reduce the costs that are incurred by exporting countries when they attempt to promote the interests of workers. By enabling and encouraging countries to promote labor standards, an appropriate form of linkage can serve as a cornerstone of a worker-oriented world trading system.",是否应将某些从事国际贸易的权利与促进劳工标准挂钩？反对这种挂钩条件的批评者对其可能带来的负面影响表示担忧是正确的。然而，挂钩机制也可能具有积极意义。一套包含挂钩机制且非强制实施、透明、基于规则、根据国家发展水平灵活适用、要求合理分担国际责任、并纳入措施确保各国不同观点得到充分考量的国际贸易规则，能够符合发展中国家的利益，尤其是这些国家中弱势群体的利益。这种挂钩体系能显著降低出口国在维护劳动者权益时付出的代价。通过赋能并鼓励各国提升劳工标准，恰当的挂钩机制可成为以劳动者为核心的世界贸易体系的基石。,"linkage, labor standards, international trade, WTO",2005-09-15

We find that adverse selection costs fall only for firms that adopt IFRS before the mandated date. We also find that firms in countries with well-developed local reporting standards do not benefit from improved transparency as a result of IFRS adoption. We also find that IFRS adoption relies on strong local enforcement to have any significant impact on transparency. We conclude that IFRS adoption may be less effective if local standards are well-developed, or are poorly enforced.",本文检验了采用国际财务报告准则(IFRS)是否会降低逆向选择成本。我们发现，只有在强制实施日期前采用IFRS的企业，其逆向选择成本才会下降。我们还发现，本地报告准则完善国家的企业并未从IFRS采用带来的透明度提升中获益。研究同时表明，IFRS的采用需要强有力的本地执法支持，才能对透明度产生显著影响。我们得出结论：当本地准则已高度完善或执法不力时，采用IFRS的效果可能较为有限。,"Inventory holding premium, Information asymmetry, International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS, Adverse selection",2017-03-29

As a standard setter, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) has pursued global consensus, harmonization and international best practices for many years. International standards, however, are often created under suboptimal conditions by actors with a broad range of motivations, assumptions and biases. Frictions between state-level regulation and international standards can undermine their effectiveness. This policy brief examines the process of standard setting and two very different sets of standards and their standard setters to illustrate some of the anomalies associated with them. The process has become more complex, more compromised and more politicized, leading in some cases to “pseudo-international” standards or a riot of diverse viewpoints, of limited practical use. The danger lies in major economies walking away from international standards which no longer demonstrate pertinence or credibility. Greater discernment should be exercised by state-level policy makers, international financial institutions and the international organizations themselves in proposing, deploying and implementing international standards.","多重冲击使得监管机构和政策制定者日益信赖国际金融标准的诊断与预防能力，但这些标准的性质、适用性及规范效力参差不齐。作为标准制定者，国际证券事务监察委员会组织（IOSCO）多年来致力于推动全球共识、协调统一与国际最佳实践。然而国际标准往往由动机、假设和偏见各异的参与方在非理想条件下制定。国家监管与国际标准之间的摩擦可能削弱其有效性。本政策简报通过考察标准制定过程及两组截然不同的标准与其制定机构，揭示其中存在的异常现象。该过程已变得更为复杂、更具妥协性且更政治化，导致某些情况下产生实用性有限的""伪国际""标准或观点纷杂的局面。主要经济体若因国际标准丧失相关性与可信度而弃之不用，将构成重大风险。国家政策制定者、国际金融机构及国际组织自身在提议、部署和实施国际标准时需加强辨别力。","IOSCO, International Financial Standards, IMF, World Bank, Credit Rating Agencies, ESMA, CESR, OECD, G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance",2018-10-29

It traces the benefits claimed for standards - their contribution to the division of labour, innovation, trust, etc.; and the costs, including entry barriers and compliance costs. It illustrates these benefits and costs with cases from accounting regulation. It adopts two approaches to the question whether accounting regulation is best achieved by a single set of standards for the world, or by competing systems. The first approach focuses on contributions in economics, including the theory of standards races and of optimal variety. In these analyses, only in special circumstances has a single standard emerged as the superior outcome. The second approach introduces evidence from accounting and finance on the problems of translating with globalised financial markets, and on the relative costs and benefits of multiple standard-setters or a single global scheme.

This interplay between obligation and flexibility has given rise to tension in various fora of the WTO, including in committee work, negotiations and dispute settlement. This paper brings together these three distinct strands of WTO work to illustrate core aspects of the international standards debate at the WTO. In our analysis we first briefly outline the nature of the discipline in the TBT Agreement itself; next, we describe where and how the discussion arises in the WTO; and, finally, explore some implications of governance of international standard setting. We propose that greater regulatory alignment could be achieved through a renewed focus on the procedures of setting international standards (the how), and greater emphasis on robust technical/scientific underpinnings of such standards (the what).",WTO《技术性贸易壁垒协定》要求各政府以国际标准作为制定法规的基础，但在标准选择及使用方式上保留了一定灵活性。这种义务与灵活性的相互作用在WTO多个场合引发了紧张关系，包括委员会工作、谈判和争端解决。本文汇集了WTO这三类不同领域的工作，以阐明国际标准辩论在WTO中的核心议题。我们的分析首先简要概述了TBT协定中相关纪律的性质；其次描述了该讨论在WTO中出现的场合及方式；最后探讨了国际标准制定治理的若干影响。我们建议通过重新聚焦国际标准制定程序（方式问题），并更加强调此类标准坚实的技术/科学基础（内容问题），可以实现更高程度的监管协调。,"international trade, international standards, international cooperation, coherence, non-tariff barriers, technical barriers to trade, regulation",2013-05-03

In 2002, the Russian Prime Minister announced that all Russian companies and banks must prepare their financial statements in accordance with international standards starting January 1, 2004. Implementing that decision will not be easy, for a variety of reasons. Not all international standards have been translated into Russian. Many Russian accountants are not sufficiently familiar with international standards to implement them. Some Russian universities have only recently started teaching international standards and the continuing education programs of the various Russian accounting associations are not yet prepared to offer comprehensive courses on international standards. Current Russian accounting standards conflict with international standards in several important ways and these conflicts will not be resolved in the near future. This paper reviews the literature on this subject and incorporates the results of interviews conducted of Russian accounting firms, enterprises and university professors in July and August 2003.",国际财务报告准则（IFRS）及其前身国际会计准则（IAS）正获得全球范围的认可。欧盟所有上市公司必须在2005年前采用这些准则，许多其他国家也已采用或计划在不久的将来采用。2002年，俄罗斯总理宣布自2004年1月1日起，所有俄罗斯公司和银行必须按照国际标准编制财务报表。由于多种原因，实施这一决定并非易事。并非所有国际准则都已翻译成俄文，许多俄罗斯会计师对国际准则不够熟悉，难以执行。一些俄罗斯大学最近才开始教授国际准则，而俄罗斯各会计协会的继续教育项目尚未准备好提供关于国际准则的全面课程。现行俄罗斯会计准则在多个重要方面与国际准则存在冲突，这些冲突短期内无法解决。本文回顾了相关文献，并整合了2003年7月至8月对俄罗斯会计师事务所、企业及大学教授的访谈结果。,"International Accounting Standards, IAS, International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS, transition economy, Russia, accounting, accounting education, corporate governance, foreign direct investment, FDI",2003-11-04

In contrast to other work, this study reviews a broad set of indicators for adherence to international standards. The estimations are conducted for emerging market economies, and pay particular attention to issues of persistence in spreads and ratings and nonlinearities in the relationships. The main finding confirms the expectation that standards are indeed relevant. Accounting standards and property rights are especially important for spreads, in addition to data transparency (SDDS subscription). Accounting standards and corruption are especially important in explaining ratings in addition to trade protectiveness (not a standard).",本文探讨了政策制定中遵循国际良好实践标准与两个关键资本市场准入指标及其成本（利差与主权评级）之间的关系。与其他研究不同，本研究采用了一套更全面的国际标准遵循评估指标。研究针对新兴市场经济体展开估算，特别关注利差与评级的持续性特征以及变量间的非线性关系。主要结论验证了研究假设：国际标准确实具有显著影响。会计准则与产权制度对利差影响尤为突出，数据透明度（SDDS订阅）同样重要；在解释主权评级方面，会计准则与腐败问题作用显著，贸易保护程度（非标准范畴）也具有解释力。,"Standards and codes, foreign exchange spreads, credit ratings, crisis prevention",2006-01-29

international standards,An Examination of Inventory Costing Convergence under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles andInternationalFinancial ReportingStandards,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2112558,Casey Reineking,"Accounting principles in the United States are converging toward international standards. If convergence continues, and there are proponents and detractors, then the U.S. system of accounting, called Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), will eventually be replaced by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Convergence has profound implications for publicly traded companies and their many stakeholders such as investors, lenders, government agencies, and employees. A key issue facing accounting standard-setters is the treatment of inventory costing, an area in which GAAP and IFRS differ. This study addresses three research questions: What is the past and current usage of different inventory costing methods?, How important is inventory on corporate financial reports?, and What will be the impact on corporate financial reporting, specifically regarding inventory costing, if IFRS replaces GAAP? Findings show that a change from GAAP to IFRS will have a major impact on inventory costing and, as a result, on corporate financial reporting overall.",美国的会计原则正逐步与国际标准接轨。若这一趋同进程持续（既有支持者也有反对者），那么美国现行的通用会计准则（GAAP）终将被国际财务报告准则（IFRS）取代。这一变革对上市公司及其众多利益相关方——包括投资者、债权人、政府机构和员工——具有深远影响。会计准则制定者面临的关键问题在于存货成本核算的处理方式，这正是GAAP与IFRS存在差异的领域。本研究聚焦三个核心问题：不同存货成本核算方法的历史与现状如何？存货在企业财务报告中的重要性体现在何处？若IFRS取代GAAP，将对企业财务报告（特别是存货成本核算方面）产生何种影响？研究结果表明，从GAAP转向IFRS将对存货成本核算产生重大影响，进而全面重塑企业财务报告体系。,"International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS, inventory costing, GAAP",2012-07-19
international standards,IDPC Response to the 2008 Annual Report of theInternationalNarcotics Control Board,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1425105,International Drug Policy Consortium,"As in previous years, the 2008 Annual Report of the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) contains a wealth of technical information on the operation of the international drug control system that attempts to manage the global licit market for narcotic and psychotropic substances for medical and research uses while simultaneously stifling the illicit market.  Interspersed with these operational descriptions are references and discussions on certain policy issues: primarily observations on the strengths and weaknesses of the system and what the INCB considers the main risks and threats to the effectiveness of that system.  While much of this data and debate is a welcome contribution to the policy process, the IDPC continues to be troubled with the selective and subjective nature of the INCB’s concerns; concerns that do not seem to flow from a balanced assessment of what constitutes non-compliance with the UN drug control conventions. In this response to the Annual Report attention is given to the INCB’s analysis of a number of interconnected issues, including the history of the drug control system and on its positions on three contemporary debates: harm reduction, the search for effective cannabis control, and the Bolivian request for reconsideration of the status of the coca leaf.  The response concludes that the INCB continues to be quick to condemn what it sees as any move towards liberalisation of policy and practice, while ignoring clear breaches of the spirit and letter of the conventions that arise from repressive policy in many countries.  Recognizing that the INCB has a crucial role to play within a global control system that is fit for purpose in the 21st century, it is argued that the Board will need to make significant changes to both its perspectives and operating procedures if it is to gain the confidence of many civil society and government stakeholders in the future.",与往年一样，2008年国际麻醉品管制局（INCB）年度报告包含了大量关于国际毒品管制体系运作的技术信息，该体系旨在管理用于医疗和科研用途的麻醉品和精神药物的全球合法市场，同时遏制非法市场。在这些运作描述中穿插着对某些政策问题的提及和讨论：主要是对该体系优势和弱点的观察，以及INCB认为对该体系有效性构成的主要风险和威胁。尽管这些数据和讨论大多是对政策进程的有益贡献，但国际药物政策联盟（IDPC）仍对INCB所关注问题的选择性和主观性感到不安；这些问题似乎并非基于对违反联合国毒品管制公约行为的平衡评估。在对年度报告的回应中，重点关注了INCB对一系列相互关联问题的分析，包括毒品管制体系的历史及其在三个当代辩论中的立场：减害、寻求有效的大麻管制，以及玻利维亚要求重新考虑古柯叶地位的请求。回应总结认为，INCB继续迅速谴责其认为任何政策与实践自由化的动向，同时忽视了许多国家压制性政策对公约精神和条款的明显违反。认识到INCB在适合21世纪的全球管制体系中扮演着关键角色，本文认为，若该机构希望在未来赢得许多民间社会和政府利益相关者的信任，就必须对其观点和运作程序进行重大调整。,,2009-06-24
international standards,LabourStandardsinInternationalTrade Agreements: An Assessment of The Arguments,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=931646,George Tsogas,"In the 1980s and 1990s organized labour in industrialized countries was hit by the demise of traditional manufacturing industries, the ever-expanding globalization of the economy and the ideological dominance of economic liberalism and free trade. Support for the introduction of labour standards in the world trade regime grew out of these conditions. This paper introduces an analytical framework for the study of labour standards in international trade agreements (LSITA) and provides a detailed examination of the individuals and organizations involved in the debate and an analysis of their arguments and activities. Experiences of LSITA fall into four categories: (i) unilateral: child and prison labour legislation and corporate codes of conduct; (ii) bilateral: the GSP programmes; (iii) multilateral: attempts in the GATT/WTO; and (iv) regional: the Social Charter of the EU and the labour side agreement of NAFTA.In the opposition group are neoclassical economists and free trade theorists; major international employers; and some Third World governments and economic elites.Among the proponents belong neo-Keynesians and neo-institutionalists; 'ethical' international employers; trade unions; the ILO; governments and politicians in industrialized countries; and a plethora of NGOs and individual activists.","20世纪80至90年代，工业化国家的有组织劳工遭受了传统制造业衰落、经济全球化持续扩张以及经济自由主义和自由贸易思想占据主导地位的三重冲击。正是在此背景下，将劳工标准纳入全球贸易体系的呼声日益高涨。本文构建了一个分析国际贸易协定中劳工标准（LSITA）的研究框架，系统考察了相关争议中的参与主体及其主张与行动。LSITA实践呈现四种形态：（一）单边措施：童工与监狱劳动立法及企业行为准则；（二）双边机制：普惠制方案；（三）多边尝试：关贸总协定/世贸组织内的努力；（四）区域实践：欧盟社会宪章与北美自贸协定劳工附加协议。反对阵营包括新古典主义经济学家与自由贸易理论家、跨国雇主集团及部分第三世界政府与经济精英；支持群体则涵盖新凯恩斯主义者与新制度主义者、""道德型""跨国企业、工会组织、国际劳工组织、工业化国家政府与政界人士，以及众多非政府组织与个人活动家。","Labour standards in international trade, workers' rights, social clause in trade",2006-09-20

Many have seen this change in the environment of International humanitarian law as a result of greater application of human rights in this area of law. This article approaches the changes in international humanitarian law from a different perspective, that of law and economics. The main claim in this article is that recent changes in international humanitarian law could be seen as a change from a rule based normative system, to a standard based one. The differences between a rule system and a standard system lie not in the complexity of the norms, but in the questions of who makes decisions and when are decisions taken. In a rule - the decisions are taken before the fact, and in a standard - after the fact. This article then evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of this move from rules to standards, and offers some observations and future possibilities for research.",近年来，许多学者撰文探讨国际人道法的变化。许多人认为，国际人道法环境的这一变化源于人权在该法律领域更广泛的应用。本文从法律与经济学的不同视角切入，分析国际人道法的变革。文章的核心观点是：近期国际人道法的变革可视为从基于规则的规范体系转向基于标准的体系。规则体系与标准体系的差异不在于规范的复杂性，而在于决策主体与决策时机的不同——规则体系事先制定决策，标准体系事后作出判断。本文进而评估了这种从规则到标准转变的利弊，并提出若干研究建议与未来可能的研究方向。,"International law, international humanitarian law, israel, rules, standards",2008-09-25

This article conceptualizes international standards as global public goods and argues for applying global administrative law principles to vet international standards before they are afforded quasi-legislative status in the WTO law. We traced how the WTO Appellate Body has changed its original hands-off approach in EC – Sardines in 2002 to a more intrusive approach in US – Tuna II in 2012. We submit that the WTO Appellate Body’s new approach to international standards marks a distinctive pathway for the development of global administrative law in producing global public goods.The compliance with global administrative law principles set out in the TBT Committee Decision in turn provides international standardizing bodies with additional legitimacy and accountability. However, contrary to popular opinion, we submit that adoption by consensus is not a necessary condition for a standard to be recognized as an international standard in the world trading system.","国际标准在《世界贸易组织技术性贸易壁垒协定》（简称《TBT协定》）中具有特殊的法律意义。本文将国际标准概念化为全球公共产品，并主张在赋予其WTO法律准立法地位前，应运用全球行政法原则对其进行审查。我们追溯了WTO上诉机构如何从2002年""欧共体－沙丁鱼案""最初的不干预态度，转变为2012年""美国－金枪鱼案(Ⅱ)""中更具介入性的立场。我们认为，上诉机构对国际标准的新态度标志着全球行政法在制定全球公共产品过程中形成了一条独特发展路径。符合TBT委员会决议所载全球行政法原则，反过来为国际标准制定机构提供了额外的合法性与问责性。但与普遍观点相反，我们认为协商一致通过并非标准被世界贸易体系认定为国际标准的必要条件。","International Standards, TBT Agreement, WTO, Global Public Goods, Global Administrative Law",2016-08-18
international standards,The Missing Links In The Chains? Mutual Distributed Ledger (aka Blockchain)Standards,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3676283,Michael Mainelli,"Commissioned by the States of Alderney, PwC, and the Cardano Foundation, Z/Yen engaged with over seventy people representing developers, regulators, standards bodies, lawyers, financiers, business-people, accountants, and potential users, to answer a number of questions:What are the potential risks associated with future widespread use of mutual distributed ledgers (MDLs), and what are their implications?How do distributed ledgers fit within existing regulatory frameworks? Are existing laws sufficient to cover the activities supported by distributed ledgers, or is new legislation is needed?Would MDLs benefit from the development of standards? Which sectors and services might need MDLs most?What different paths could be taken to create standards?MDLs hold immense promise, although the spectrum of opinion regarding their future varied widely. Developers, naturally, saw a host of opportunities to transform business practices and offer new services. The financial services sector held the most nuanced views, perhaps due to their sensitivities about disruption in payments. The prevailing view was that firms would inevitably use MDLs, though with understandable caution about governance and compliance issues. Public sector bodies were less aware of the potential that MDLs held, but there was some quiet enthusiasm. Amongst professional and financial services, views were mixed. There was extreme skepticism contrasting with extreme enthusiasm in legal services. The pessimism was anticipation of less future business when things go right. The optimism prompted by a hope that smart contracts were rather likely to generate commercial conflicts.So how should regulators view distributed ledger technology? Regulators carry out three primary roles: promoting competition, maintaining the integrity of markets, and interpreting jurisdictional policy. MDLs have the potential both to support and hinder these functions.In terms of competition, the key feature of MDLs is their challenge to the natural monopolies created by central third parties.In terms of market integrity the transparent nature of MDLs greatly reduces the opportunities for theft and fraud, though encryption could make establishing the identities of buyers and sellers more difficult.In terms of enforcement, the transparency of MDLs and the permanence of transactions logged on the chain should make regulatory tasks easier, though, as MDLs are more likely to operate across jurisdictions they could provoke regulatory conflict.All new technology carries risk, but what exactly does this mean in the context of MDLs?We can categorize the risks associated with MDLs into a number of areas, but three occupied the thoughts of the majority of the practitioners we spoke with.Governance: organisations will need to put in place many inter-organisational structures to manage MDLs. How will errors be corrected? Who will have authority to write to the ledger? Will there be a central authority who can make changes to the records, or change the entire system to help it evolve?Liability and Responsibility: How should high risk activities such as AML and KYC be handled? Who will ‘carry the can’ if things go wrong? What systems are in place to manage and resolve disputes?Taxonomies: What exactly is any specific MDL in front of a regulator, permissioned-unpermissioned, public-private, opaque-transparent, proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, voting, woven broadcasting? What are the tolerances and performance capabilities? These questions are of pressing concern to users but, as this is a rapidly developing field, a common language has not yet been developed.MDLs will realize their potential to contribute to economic growth when the technology is widely diffused and used. Diffusion itself results from a series of individual decisions to begin using the new technology, decisions which are often the result of a comparison of the uncertain benefits of the technology with the uncertain costs of adopting it. It is diffusion, rather than invention or innovation, that ultimately determines the pace of economic growth and the rate of change of productivity, and until many users adopt MDL technology it may contribute little to our well-being.The key to ensuring widespread diffusion is ensuring that distributed ledgers are viewed as a safe, reliable technology, but how can regulators assist with this?Regulators have two primary levers they can use, regulation and standards:Regulation is sometimes a knee-jerk response by policy makers to perceived risk. While it can be speedy and authoritative, the process to create regulations can be distanced from the participants, resulting in unnecessary burdens or unforeseen consequences. Standards, if implemented as part of a voluntary standards market with strict certification and accreditation can be highly effective. However, adoption can be slower and piecemeal. Voluntary standards without certification and accreditation are little more than guidance notes. They have no sanction for non-compliance and they are not an effective tool for regulators. Without certification, there is no independent verification that a standard has been met. A strong voluntary standards market requires verifiers to be accredited, as this ensures quality and indemnity behind certification. This triple-lock; standards, certification and accreditation, is the bedrock of a voluntary standards market.It is important to remember that in the majority of cases MDLs will support existing services that have existing processes and support technologies. There will be a rich standards and regulation landscape that they must negotiate in order to be fit for purpose. Simpler, less regulated domains are more likely to adopt MDL approaches earlier, particularly where MDLs can solve an unaddressed problem, e.g. know-your-customer/anti-money-laundering/ultimate-beneficial-ownership in financial services, and offer a difference to traditional central third party approaches, e.g. meeting EU General Data Protection Regulation for the “right to be forgotten” surrounding identity documentation.Are new regulations needed for MDLs? MDLs will, in the majority of cases, be deployed into existing regulatory environments. Unless regulations specifically stipulate the use of third party intermediaries, they are likely to be sufficient to cover the activities supported by MDLs.There was considerable interest amongst participants in the area of so called “smart contracts”, this is dealt with in detail in the report, but in summary, stating that “the code is law” is not a sufficient response, and the real world legal agreements that connect organizations to smart contracts will need to be very carefully constructed.This diagram represents the standards environment. At its core are technical standards that determine how technologies perform. At its periphery are thematic standards dealing with the generic issues every organisation must deal with. Sandwiched between these two are sector specific standards which deal with activities and processes.From our discussions with participants we conclude that it is probably too early to begin developing performance standards for MDLs. The technology is still evolving and technical standards would stifle innovation, though there is scope to consider carbon standards for proof-of-work cryptocurrency applications. Participants felt that existing thematic standards, such as ISO9000 for quality management or ISO 31000 for risk management, were probably flexible enough to cover the use of MDLs. Most participants felt most benefits lay in sectoral standards, with three salient points:There is a need to develop a common language to categorize and typify MDLs; There is a need to consider the way MDLs are managed and permissioned, how data is managed, who has access to it, how it can be changed or corrected, who pays for mistakes; There is a need to carefully consider liability and indemnity, particularly with respect to identity, and more widely helping to develop ‘trust structures’ that provide the multi-organisational, non-technical, cooperating framework. So what might standards in these areas look like?Taxonomies & performance standards need to be outcome-focused sets of definitions and characteristics, so that regulators and potential purchasers can assess MDLs based on their outputs, rather than the mechanics of how they operate; Data governance & liability standards need to pay fundamental attention to the civil liberty implications of data aggregation, sharing and mining; Commercial governance & liability standards need to structure how organisations link legally and contractually with MDLs. So how could a voluntary standards market be established? Three potential routes present themselves;ISO standards developed at a global level with national standards institutions and wider stakeholders. Standards Australia are considering this route on technical standards for block-chains. ISO standards carry immense credibility because of their well-established model for certification and accreditation, but the ISO path can be a long one;Publically Available Specifications (PASs) created with a national standards institution, perhaps later rolled-out as an ISO standard. This route has the advantage of creating standards which are close to the industries they are intended for, resulting in cost-effective and streamlined solutions.Open process standards work up from industry participants, but can suffer from a tendency to certification and accreditation procedures, the end result can lack credibility.In conclusion, “The Missing Links in the Chains” confirms that the establishment of a voluntary standards market may be beneficial in promoting the uptake of MDLs by providing certainty to both users and developers, while assisting regulators in fulfilling their duties. Further consideration is needed on the scope of ‘taxonomies & performance’, ‘data governance & liability’, and ‘commercial governance & liability’. And of course, a big question mark about what group is prepared to pay to take standards forward?","受奥尔德尼岛政府、普华永道和卡尔达诺基金会委托，泽尼咨询公司调研了七十余位代表开发者、监管机构、标准组织、律师、金融从业者、商人、会计师及潜在用户的专业人士，旨在解答以下核心问题：未来广泛应用的互惠分布式账本（MDL）存在哪些潜在风险及其影响？分布式账本如何适配现有监管框架？现行法律是否足以覆盖其支持的业务活动，抑或需要新立法？MDL是否会受益于标准制定？哪些行业服务最需要MDL？制定标准可采取哪些不同路径？. . 尽管对MDL前景的看法差异显著，其巨大潜力已获公认。开发者自然视其为变革商业实践和提供新服务的机遇。金融服务业因对支付领域颠覆的敏感性持最审慎态度，普遍认为企业终将采用MDL，但对治理与合规问题保持合理谨慎。公共部门对MDL潜力认知有限，但存在隐性热情。专业与金融服务领域观点分化，法律界呈现极端怀疑与极度乐观的两极——悲观者预期业务量将因技术完善而缩减，乐观者则寄望智能合约引发商业纠纷带来机遇。. . 监管者应如何看待分布式账本技术？其三大核心职能——促进竞争、维护市场完整性和解释管辖政策——均可能被MDL强化或削弱。就竞争而言，MDL关键特性在于挑战中心化第三方形成的自然垄断；市场完整性方面，其透明特性虽大幅降低盗窃欺诈可能，但加密技术或增加买卖双方身份核验难度；执法层面，交易链上永久存证虽简化监管任务，但跨境运作特性可能引发监管冲突。. . MDL相关风险可归为三类，从业者最关注：治理（需建立跨组织管理架构，纠错机制、账本写入权限、系统演进决策权归属）、责任划分（反洗钱等高风险活动处理、事故追责机制、争议解决体系）、分类体系（监管面对的具体MDL属性判定：许可/非许可、公有/私有、透明/不透明、工作量证明/权益证明/投票/广播等机制的性能容限）。这些迫切问题尚未形成统一术语体系。. . MDL对经济增长的贡献取决于技术普及度。普及源于个体对技术不确定收益与采纳成本的权衡，正是普及而非发明创新最终决定经济增长与生产率变化速度。确保广泛普及的关键在于建立安全可靠的技术形象，监管者可通过两种杠杆实现：监管与标准。监管虽是政策制定者对风险的快速反应，但可能脱离实践导致负担；而具备严格认证体系的志愿性标准市场则更为高效。需注意无认证的自愿标准仅具指导性，有效标准市场需构建""标准-认证-认可""三位一体机制。. . 多数情况下MDL将服务于现有业务，需适应庞杂的标准与监管体系。监管空白领域（如金融业中客户身份识别/反洗钱/最终受益人确认）或更早采用MDL方案，尤其是能解决传统中心化模式痛点（如满足欧盟《通用数据保护条例》""被遗忘权""要求）的场景。现有监管框架通常足以覆盖MDL活动，除非法规明确要求第三方中介。参与者对""智能合约""尤为关注，但""代码即法律""远不足够，需精心设计连接组织与智能合约的现实法律协议。. . 标准环境可分为三层核心：决定技术性能的技术标准、处理通用议题的主题标准、针对行业活动的领域标准。与从业者讨论表明，目前制定MDL性能标准为时尚早，技术演进可能受限于过早标准化（工作量证明加密货币的碳足迹标准除外）。现有主题标准（如ISO9000质量管理、ISO31000风险管理）已足够灵活。领域标准建设最具价值，需聚焦三点：建立MDL分类通用术语体系；规范数据管理权限、纠错机制及责任归属；构建身份识别等领域的责任赔偿框架及多组织非技术性""信任结构""。. . 具体标准应具备以下特征：分类与性能标准需结果导向，便于监管者和购买者基于输出而非运作机制评估MDL；数据治理标准需重点关注数据聚合、共享及挖掘的公民自由影响；商业治理标准需明确组织与MDL的法律契约连接方式。建立志愿性标准市场有三条路径：ISO全球标准（权威但周期长）、国家标准机构推出的公开可用规范（PAS，可后续升级为ISO标准）、行业自下而上的开放流程标准（可能缺乏认证严谨性）。. . 《链条缺失的环节》最终确认：建立志愿性标准市场可通过为用户和开发者提供确定性来促进MDL采纳，同时辅助监管履职。""分类与性能""、""数据治理与责任""、""商业治理与责任""三大范畴需深入探讨。核心问题在于：哪方群体愿为标准推进承担成本？","Mutual Distributed Ledger Standards, MDLs, Standards",2020-10-07

The authors begin with a critique of Mr. Costa’s contribution to the publication and often the only part of the 300-page document that receives significant attention: the Executive Director’s Foreword. They also reflect briefly upon his tenure at the UNODC between 2002 and 2010. Mindful of the volume of market related and trend oriented data within the Report, the authors then move onto to provide a summary of the global picture as presented by the UNODC in the main body of the text. Within this section, they also highlight ongoing examples of the Office’s increasingly sophisticated and transparent methodology.

international standards,Banking Reform in China: Driven byInternationalStandardsand Chinese Specifics,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1026854,Zdenek Kudrna,"This paper reviews the progress of banking reforms in China over the last five years. The stated goal of reform is to ""transform major banks into internationally competitive joint-stock commercial banks with appropriate corporate governance structures, adequate capital, stringent internal controls, safe and sound business operations, quality services as well as desirable profitability."" The reform strategy relies on three pillars - extensive publicly-financed bailouts, implementation of the international best practices in bank governance and regulation and listing of major banks at the Hong Kong stock exchange. This strategy has been successful in stabilizing the three major banks. However, our review of academic and commercial research indicates that there is no evidence that the stabilization is sustainable. Prudential indicators of the largest banks are comparable to international averages, but this is an outcome of large bail outs and ongoing credit boom rather than fundamental change in banker's incentives. Reforms of bank governance and regulatory framework need more time to proliferate throughout the banking and regulatory hierarchies. However, time alone would not solve the problem as the reform design retains important departures from international standards. These standards are implemented in a selective manner; those aspects that help to concentrate key powers in the center are implemented rather vigorously, whereas principles that require independence of banks' boards and regulators are ignored. Thus the largest Chinese banks remain under the firm state control and can be used as development policy tools for the better or the worse.","本文回顾了过去五年中国银行业改革的进展。改革宣称的目标是""将主要银行转变为具有适当公司治理结构、充足资本、严格内控、安全稳健运营、优质服务及良好盈利能力的国际竞争力股份制商业银行""。改革战略依托三大支柱——大规模公共资金救助、实施国际最佳银行治理与监管实践以及在香港交易所上市主要银行。该策略已成功稳定了三大银行，但学术与商业研究显示尚无证据表明这种稳定具有可持续性。大型银行的审慎指标与国际平均水平相当，但这源于巨额救助和持续的信贷繁荣，而非银行家激励机制的实质性变革。银行治理与监管框架改革需要更长时间渗透至整个银行与监管体系，但仅靠时间无法解决问题，因改革方案仍存在与国际标准的重要偏离。这些标准被选择性执行：有助于集中核心权力至中央的方面得到有力落实，而要求银行董事会和监管机构独立性的原则则被忽视。因此中国大型银行仍受国家牢牢掌控，可能被用作发展政策工具——无论利弊。","China, banks, reform, international standards",2007-11-03

Consequently, the setting of international standards is rapidly becoming an issue of considerable economic and political salience.  But who sets international standards? Who wins, who loses?  Building on previous studies we have done, we are presenting in this paper a first general theory of international regulatory processes that take place in non-governmental institutional settings.   Largely overlooked in IPE, these processes have moved to center-stage of global regulation as states have delegated ever-greater regulatory authority to transnational non-governmental bodies.  Our theory provides a comprehensive account of how domestic or regional institutional features of private-sector groups systematically shape the politics of global regulation.  We test a series of propositions on data collected by us through international business surveys over the last six years, covering both product and financial markets. We conclude by highlighting the challenges to global due process and democratic governance identified by our research.",各国标准不一往往阻碍商品和服务贸易。因此，国际标准的制定正迅速成为具有重大经济和政治意义的议题。但谁在制定国际标准？谁赢谁输？基于我们既往研究，本文首次提出关于非政府机构背景下国际监管进程的通用理论。随着各国将越来越多的监管权授予跨国非政府机构，这些被国际政治经济学长期忽视的进程已跃居全球监管的核心舞台。我们的理论全面阐释了私营部门群体的国内或区域制度特征如何系统性影响全球监管政治。通过分析过去六年国际商业调查中收集的产品与金融市场数据，我们验证了一系列理论命题。最后着重指出本研究发现的对全球正当程序与民主治理的挑战。,"international political economy, finance, accounting, standards, international organizations, non-state actors",2009-09-03

The Transfer of Hospital DesignStandardsbyInternationalOrganizations and Private Firms,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2335406,Rodica Plugaru,"This paper explores the role of international actors in post-communist transformation. By taking the case of hospital design standards, it explains how the national actors choose to leave aside the national regulations and to adopt foreign technical standards. The paper takes the case of technical standards employed for the modernization of healthcare facilities in Ukraine and Moldova. An in-depth comparative case study of two projects revealed that national architects of these post-soviet countries use foreign standards. While the change of standards is a similar outcome in both cases, the international actors involved are different. My findings suggest that while both international organizations and private actors diffuse foreign technical standards in post-soviet countries, the processes through which they realize it differs. Whereas international organizations dispose of coercive means to impose foreign solutions, private actors need to negotiate and to convince for their adoption. Drawing on recent debates on policy diffusion and transfer (Dolowitz and Marsh 2012; 2000, Simmons and al. 2008, Stone 2010, 2012), the results shed light on “carriers” of institutional arrangements among different political systems.","本文探讨了国际行为体在后共产主义转型中的作用。通过医院设计标准的案例，文章阐释了国家行为体如何选择搁置本国法规而采用外国技术标准。研究以乌克兰和摩尔多瓦医疗设施现代化过程中采用的技术标准为例，对两个项目进行深入比较案例研究发现：这些后苏联国家的建筑师均采用了外国标准。虽然标准变更的结果相似，但所涉国际行为体却各不相同。研究结果表明：尽管国际组织和私营行为体都在后苏联国家传播外国技术标准，但其实现路径存在差异——国际组织可通过强制性手段推行外国方案，而私营行为体则需通过协商说服来实现标准采纳。基于政策扩散与转移的最新讨论（Dolowitz and Marsh 2012; 2000, Simmons et al. 2008, Stone 2010, 2012），研究结果揭示了不同政治体系间制度安排的""传播载体""。","transfer, standards, international actors, post-soviet states",2013-10-04
international standards,Guide to theInternationalBanking Statistics,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1188182,Bank for International Settlements,"Note: This document has been superseded by Guidelines to the international locational banking statistics and Guidelines to the international consolidated banking statistics This Guide to the international banking statistics is intended to serve two main purposes: firstly, to provide reporting countries with definitions and guidelines for the reporting of data; secondly, to give a detailed account of current country practices regarding the coverage and disaggregation of the reported data. The Guide describes two statistical systems, the locational banking statistics and the consolidated banking statistics. It replaces the previous issue (July 2000) and includes numerous changes and updates to the tables on countries' reporting practices. The locational banking statistics, which are described in Part I, gather quarterly data on international financial claims and liabilities of bank offices resident in the reporting countries broken down by currency, sector and country of residence of counterparty, and by nationality of reporting banks. In this system, both domestic and foreign-owned banking offices in the reporting countries record their positions on a gross (unconsolidated) basis, including those vis-ý-vis own affiliates, which is consistent with the principles of national accounts, balance of payments and external debt statistics. The statistics were introduced with a breakdown by major individual currencies and a partial sectoral and geographical breakdown at the beginning of the 1970s to provide information on the development and growth of the eurocurrency markets. In the subsequent years, the issue of recycling oil-related surpluses and the accompanying rise in international indebtedness shifted the emphasis in favour of a more detailed geographical breakdown and of flow data. The outbreak of the debt crisis in the early 1980s stimulated further efforts to refine both the geographical coverage of the data and the estimates of exchange rate adjusted flows. In the early 1990s, strong interest arose in making use of these statistics to improve the coverage and accuracy of the recording of balance of payments transactions. Following the financial crises in emerging economies in the late 1990s the locational banking statistics became an important component of the Joint BIS-IMF-OECD-World Bank Statistics on External Debt, which were developed in response to requests for dissemination of more timely external debt indicators. The consolidated banking statistics, which are described in Part II, collect quarterly data on banks' international financial claims broken down by remaining maturity and sector of borrower. In addition, they include information on exposures by country of immediate borrower and on the reallocation of claims (ie risk transfers) to the country of ultimate risk. The latter is defined as the country where the guarantor of a claim resides. The data mainly cover claims reported by domestic bank head offices, including the exposures of their foreign affiliates, and are collected on a worldwide consolidated basis with inter-office positions being netted out. The statistics also provide separate data on international claims of foreign bank offices whose head offices are located outside the reporting countries on an unconsolidated basis. The statistics were introduced as a semiannual reporting exercise in the late 1970s and early 1980s to provide information on the country risk exposures of major individual nationality banking groups to developing countries. Following the financial crises in emerging economies in the late 1990s, the consolidated banking statistics were enhanced to include complete country coverage of banks' on-balance sheet exposures, separate country data on an ultimate risk basis and a move to a quarterly reporting frequency. In response to recommendations of a working group of the CGFS, and in order to maintain the consolidated banking statistics as a key source of public information on international financial market developments, it is planned to improve the measurement of commercial banks' consolidated country risk exposures on an ultimate risk basis. Consequently, the statistics will, as from end-2004, cover more detailed and comprehensive data on country risk exposures inclusive of derivatives and other off-balance sheet positions. Part III of this Guide provides a glossary of terms used in the locational and consolidated banking statistics, while part IV contains a list of international organisations (Appendix 1) and official monetary authorities (Appendix 2). Beginning in 1998, the BIS has invited a number of additional countries, in particular from emerging markets, to participate in the international banking statistics. This is intended to further increase the global coverage of the statistics. So far, 12 economies have joined the locational (Australia, Bermuda, Brazil, Chile, Guernsey, India, Isle of Man, Jersey, Panama, Portugal, Taiwan (China) and Turkey) and nine have joined the consolidated (Brazil, Chile, Hong Kong, India, Panama, Portugal, Singapore, Taiwan (China), and Turkey) banking statistics, with more countries expected to be included in the near future. The Guide has been prepared with the assistance of the central banks or official authorities contributing to the two sets of international banking statistics. The BIS is grateful to all these institutions for their cooperation and valuable advice in its preparation. Note: This document supersedes ""The Guide to the International Banking Statistics"" (July 2000)","注：本文件已被《国际银行区位统计指南》和《国际银行合并统计指南》所取代。本《国际银行统计指南》旨在实现两个主要目的：一是为报告国提供数据报告的定义和指导；二是详细说明当前各国在报告数据的覆盖范围和分类方面的做法。本指南描述了两大统计体系——区位银行统计与合并银行统计。它取代了前一版（2000年7月），并对各国报告实践表格进行了大量修改和更新。. . 第一部分阐述的区位银行统计按季度收集报告国境内银行机构的国际金融债权与负债数据，并按货币、部门、交易对手居住国及报告银行国籍进行细分。该体系要求报告国境内的本国与外资银行机构以总额（未合并）形式记录头寸（包括与关联机构的交易），这符合国民账户、国际收支和外债统计原则。该统计于1970年代初推出时，按主要货币分类并包含部分部门和地域细分，旨在追踪欧洲货币市场的发展。随后因石油相关盈余回流及国际债务问题加剧，统计重点转向更详细的地域分类和流量数据。1980年代初的债务危机推动了对数据地理覆盖范围和汇率调整流量估算的进一步优化。1990年代初，这些统计被广泛用于提升国际收支交易的记录覆盖面和准确性。1990年代末新兴经济体金融危机后，区位银行统计成为""BIS-IMF-OECD-世界银行联合外债统计""的重要组成部分，该体系是为响应提高外债指标时效性的需求而建立。. . 第二部分阐述的合并银行统计按季度收集银行国际金融债权数据，并按剩余期限、借款部门分类，同时包含直接借款国风险敞口信息及债权重分配（即风险转移）至最终风险国的数据（最终风险国定义为债权担保人所在国）。数据主要涵盖国内银行总行及其海外分支机构的全球合并报表（剔除内部头寸），并单独列示总部位于报告国境外的外资银行机构的未合并国际债权。该统计最初于1970年代末至1980年代初作为半年度报告推出，用于监测主要跨国银行集团对发展中国家的国别风险敞口。1990年代末金融危机后，统计范围扩展至银行表内敞口的全国家覆盖、基于最终风险的国别数据细分，并改为季度报告。根据全球金融体系委员会工作组的建议，为保持该统计作为国际金融市场发展核心公共信息来源的地位，计划从2004年底起纳入包含衍生品及其他表外头寸的更全面国别风险敞口数据。. . 本指南第三部分提供两大统计体系的术语表，第四部分列出国际组织（附录1）和官方货币当局（附录2）名录。自1998年起，国际清算银行邀请更多新兴市场国家加入统计体系以扩大全球覆盖面。目前已有12个经济体加入区位统计（澳大利亚、百慕大、巴西、智利、根西岛、印度、马恩岛、泽西岛、巴拿马、葡萄牙、中国台湾和土耳其），9个加入合并统计（巴西、智利、中国香港、印度、巴拿马、葡萄牙、新加坡、中国台湾和土耳其），预计未来将有更多国家参与。. . 本指南在参与两大国际银行统计的各国央行及官方机构协助下完成，国际清算银行对所有合作机构提供的宝贵建议深表感谢。注：本文件取代《国际银行统计指南》（2000年7月版）",,2008-07-30

On one hand, standards have an important role in shaping social environmental sustainability and therefore promoting economic, political, cultural and geographical development. On the other hand, their uncoordinated proliferation can generate misleading signals and measurements, compromising their ability to fulfill their role. The non-governmental nature of these regulations poses challenges to uniform standardization across the global value chain. In face of this problem, some countries have launched national platforms to establish minimal criteria on which the standard can be created.

Brennan,"This paper explores the extent to which there are significant differences in disclosure requirements under US, UK, international accounting standards. Previous research into international disclosure diversity has focused on an analysis of disclosure practices in different countries rather than on disclosures required by regulations in different countries. Financial disclosures required by UK professional regulations and by International Accounting Standards (IASs) are summarised and classified using Barth and Murphy’s (1994) categorisation by purpose of disclosure and by category and subject. US, UK and international required disclosures are compared and areas of divergence are highlighted. Although differences in required disclosures between the three regulatory regimes are evident from the analysis, these differences are not significant in the multivariate models tested. A notable difference is greater required disclosures in the UK/IASs concerning entity structures (business combinations, consolidations, segmental reporting etc.).A greater proportion of US required disclosures address risks and potentials and assess returns. A much greater proportion of UK/IASs disclosures related to items recognised in accounts. The Financial Accounting Standards Board is currently examining the issue of disclosure effectiveness in the US. By highlighting areas of diversity in required disclosures in the US, UK and internationally this study will add insights to this discussion of disclosure effectiveness.",本文探讨了美国、英国及国际会计准则在披露要求上存在显著差异的程度。既往关于国际披露差异性的研究多聚焦于各国披露实践的分析，而非基于各国法规要求的披露内容。研究采用Barth和Murphy（1994）按披露目的及类别主题的分类框架，对英国专业准则与国际会计准则（IASs）要求的财务披露进行了系统归纳。通过对比美、英与国际准则的法定披露内容，重点揭示了关键分歧领域。分析表明：虽然三种监管体系在披露要求上存在明显差异，但这些差异在测试的多变量模型中并不显著。一个显著区别在于英国/IASs对实体结构（企业合并、合并报表、分部报告等）的披露要求更为严格；美国准则更高比例的披露涉及风险与潜力评估及收益预测；而英国/IASs的披露内容中与账目确认项目相关的比例明显更高。美国财务会计准则委员会当前正研究披露有效性问题，本研究通过厘清美、英及国际准则在法定披露要求上的差异领域，将为这场关于披露有效性的讨论提供新的认知视角。,"Financial Reporting, Accounting Standards, Required Disclosures, UK GAAP, US GAAP, International Accounting Standards",2013-05-01

Our results show that for both industrial and extractive firms direct cash flow statements are value relevant under Australian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (AGAAP) and remain so after the adoption of IFRS. In addition, for industrial firms there is a significant increase in the value relevance of direct cash flows after IFRS, along with an increase in the value relevance of accruals. These results are consistent with the proposition that direct cash flows play a reinforcing role that complements the more complex IFRS accounts. Consequently, if the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) were to mandate direct cash flow statements it would, in all likelihood, provide users of accounts with a valuable incremental source of hard transaction information.",本研究探讨了澳大利亚采用国际财务报告准则(IFRS)后，直接现金流量组成部分的价值相关性是否发生变化。研究结果表明，无论是工业企业还是采掘企业，在澳大利亚公认会计原则(AGAAP)下直接现金流量表都具有价值相关性，且在采用IFRS后依然保持。此外，对于工业企业而言，采用IFRS后直接现金流量的价值相关性显著提升，应计项目的价值相关性也有所增加。这些发现支持了直接现金流量对更复杂的IFRS账目具有补充强化作用的观点。因此，如果国际会计准则理事会(IASB)强制要求编制直接现金流量表，很可能会为财务报表使用者提供宝贵的增量硬交易信息来源。,"Cash flows and International Financial Reporting Standards, Direct cash flow method, IFRS cash flow value relevance",2011-10-05

The 18-month period to contest Bolivia’s requested amendment ends January 31, 2011. In 2009, Bolivia’s first indigenous President, Evo Morales Ayma, sent a request to the United Nations to remove the unjustified ban on coca leaf chewing. This would amend the 1961 United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and bring it in line with the 2007 UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Mr Morales sought to correct a historical error. He stated in his letter to the Secretary General: ""Coca leaf chewing is one of the socio-cultural practices and rituals of the Andean indigenous peoples. It is closely linked to our history and cultural identity.” This ancestral practice ""cannot and should not be prohibited.” In the 1990s, a study conducted by the World Health Organisation concluded that chewing coca causes none of the harmful health or social consequences as cocaine use.  The US blocked the publication of this evidence. The US and a number of other governments including the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Denmark, the Russian Federation, Japan and Colombia are now planning to stop the right of Bolivians to express their own culture. They are planning to lodge formal objections to the amendment prior to the deadline on the January 31, 2011 which would result in the UN rejecting the Bolivian request. Jeremy Corbyn, a UK Member of Parliament and the Secretary of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Bolivia, said, “At a time when drug prohibition has enriched and emboldened criminal cartels to such an extent that they are attempting to violently annex the state in parts of Mexico and Guatemala, the US is expending considerable effort in blocking the Bolivian government’s legitimate and democratic right to protect and preserve a harmless indigenous practice. The international community needs to get its priorities right and resist this culturally ignorant attempt to dictate to indigenous people in Bolivia.” The International Drug Policy Consortium (IDPC) calls on countries not to oppose the amendment. Ann Fordham, the Coordinator of IDPC, stated, “Bolivia has made a reasonable and democratic request to the international community. The fact that predominantly western countries are unwilling to allow even the slightest amendments to the drug control regime, even where they conflict with the cultural and indigenous rights, is a very worrying development.”","以美国为首的多个国家政府正试图阻止玻利维亚政府提出的解除对咀嚼古柯叶这一古老习俗国际禁令的请求。针对玻利维亚修正案请求的18个月异议期将于2011年1月31日截止。2009年，玻利维亚首位原住民总统埃沃·莫拉莱斯向联合国提交申请，要求取消对咀嚼古柯叶的不合理禁令。这将修正1961年《联合国麻醉品单一公约》，使其与2007年《联合国原住民权利宣言》保持一致。莫拉莱斯总统旨在纠正历史错误，他在致联合国秘书长的信中指出：""咀嚼古柯叶是安第斯原住民的社会文化实践与仪式，与我们的历史和文化认同紧密相连。""这项古老习俗""不能也不应被禁止""。上世纪90年代，世界卫生组织研究证实咀嚼古柯叶不会像可卡因那样危害健康或引发社会问题，但美国阻止了该证据的公布。目前美国联合英国、法国、德国、意大利、瑞典、丹麦、俄罗斯联邦、日本和哥伦比亚等国政府，企图剥夺玻利维亚人民表达自身文化的权利。这些国家计划在2011年1月31日截止日期前正式提出反对意见，这将导致联合国驳回玻利维亚的请求。英国议会玻利维亚事务小组秘书杰里米·科尔宾议员表示：""当毒品禁令助长犯罪集团气焰，导致墨西哥和危地马拉部分地区暴力横行之际，美国却竭力阻挠玻利维亚政府保护无害传统习俗的合法民主权利。国际社会应分清轻重，抵制这种对玻利维亚原住民文化无知的干涉行为。""国际毒品政策 consortium（IDPC）呼吁各国不要反对该修正案。IDPC协调员安·福特汉姆指出：""玻利维亚向国际社会提出了合理民主的请求。主要西方国家甚至不愿对毒品管制制度做出最微小的调整，即便这些规定与原住民文化权利相冲突，这种趋势令人深感忧虑。""","Bolivia, Colombia, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Sweden, UK, USA, Access to essential medicines, Coca, Cocaine, Drugs and cultural heritage, Human rights, International policy, UN system incoherence, Latin America",2011-08-15

We provide insights into the following issues: (i) how do standards impact value chain governance, including whether standards allow for ‘hands-off’ governance, (ii) what are the effects of mainstreaming strategies, (iii) how do standards change actors’ roles following standard adoption, and (iv) what leads to exclude some and involve others. Research also provides a good understanding of how value chain structure has changed following the implementation of standards and, conversely, how a certain structure/governance type allows for standard implementation along the chain. While upgrading opportunities is an important question for producers in the developing world, only a few studies researched this issue and many questions remain open. On the other hand, studies show that smallholders struggled when adopting standards and pointed out that the distribution of benefits is not even along the chain.","尽管标准在国际贸易和全球价值链中扮演着日益重要的角色，但人们对其在这些链条中的实际影响知之甚少。通过采用系统性文献研究方法，本文总结了针对该问题的主要研究发现。我们深入探讨了以下议题：（一）标准如何影响价值链治理，包括标准是否支持""放手式""治理；（二）主流化策略会产生哪些效应；（三）标准采纳后如何改变参与者的角色定位；（四）导致部分群体被排斥而其他群体被纳入的成因。研究还清晰揭示了标准实施后价值链结构的演变过程，以及特定结构/治理类型如何促成标准在链条中的贯彻实施。虽然升级机遇对发展中国家生产者至关重要，但仅有少数研究探讨该议题，诸多问题仍悬而未决。另一方面，研究表明小农在采纳标准时面临困境，并指出利益分配沿价值链呈现不均衡态势。","Standards, Food standards, Certification, Value Chain, Trade, Bibliographies",2012-12-07
international standards,DoInternationalLaborStandardsContribute to the Persistence of the Child Labor Problem?,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1423330,Matthias Doepke,"In recent years, a number of governments and consumer groups in rich countries have tried to discourage the use of child labor in poor countries through measures such as product boycotts and the imposition of international labor standards. The purported objective of such measures is to reduce the incidence of child labor in developing countries and thereby improve children's welfare. In this paper, we examine the effects of such policies from a political-economy perspective. We show that these types of international action on child labor tend to lower domestic political support within developing countries for banning child labor. Hence, international labor standards and product boycotts may delay the ultimate eradication of child labor.",近年来，多个富裕国家的政府和消费者团体试图通过产品抵制、实施国际劳工标准等措施，阻止贫困国家使用童工。这类措施的公开目标在于减少发展中国家的童工现象，从而改善儿童福利。本文从政治经济学视角分析了此类政策的影响。研究表明，这类国际童工干预措施会削弱发展中国家内部禁止童工的本土政治支持。因此，国际劳工标准与产品抵制反而可能延缓彻底消除童工的进程。,"international labor standards, political economy, child labor, trade sanctions",2009-06-21

international standards,Diffusion of ISO 9000StandardsandInternationalTrade,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=650703,Michal Grajek,"Investigating the link between ISO 9000 standards and bilateral exports, this paper contributes to the literature on standardization and international trade. A debate exists as to how ISO 9000 impacts trade. First, it has been argued that ISO 9000 is a ""common language"" that lowers information asymmetries between firms, thus, allowing more efficient organization of inter-firm trade. Second, ISO 9000 has been criticized as a means of introducing market-entry barriers and a tariff on international trade. To assess the actual impact we estimate a gravity equation for bilateral exports incorporating ISO 9000 adoptions in each country as factors affecting bilateral trade barriers. Endogeneity issues are carefully addressed. To obtain additional insights, we separately estimate an ISO 9000 international diffusion equation. In general, our results support the ""common language"" hypothesis, i.e., the empirical tests find both domestic and foreign ISO 9000 adoptions to benefit bilateral exports. Moreover, we find evidence for a substitution effect, as ISO 9000 certified firms tend to trade with each other more than with uncertified firms. Consequently, the positive impact of these standards on trade is more pronounced among ISO 9000 abundant countries.","本文研究了ISO 9000标准与双边出口之间的联系，为标准化与国际贸易领域的文献做出了贡献。关于ISO 9000如何影响贸易存在争议：一方面，有观点认为该标准作为""通用语言""能降低企业间的信息不对称，从而更高效地组织企业间贸易；另一方面，批评者指出其可能成为设置市场准入壁垒和变相贸易关税的手段。为评估实际影响，我们通过引力模型测算双边出口，将各国ISO 9000认证情况作为影响双边贸易壁垒的因素纳入考量，并谨慎处理了内生性问题。为进一步分析，我们还单独估算了ISO 9000国际扩散方程。总体而言，研究结果支持""通用语言""假说——实证检验表明国内外ISO 9000认证均有利于双边出口增长。此外，我们发现认证企业之间存在替代效应，它们相互间的贸易往来显著多于与非认证企业的交易。因此，这些标准对贸易的积极影响在ISO 9000认证普及率高的国家更为显著。","Gravity model, international trade, ISO 9000, adoption of standards, network effects, compatibility",2005-01-19

Wirth,"Private voluntary standards such as the International Organization for Standardization's (ISO's) 14000 series have played an increasingly important role in encouraging corporations to adopt more sustainable business models on their own initiative and not in direct response to governmentally mandated requirements. ISO standards have a number of benefits, including promoting international uniformity; elevating environmental issues within an enterprise; promoting international trade; and providing a minimal level of environmental performance in countries with less than adequate regulatory infrastructure. Concerns about ISO standards include the relationship to public regulation; and ISO 14001's essentially procedural, as opposed to performance-based, character.  International trade agreements such as NAFTA and the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade inject ISO standards into the public policy arena. Because of the structure of these agreements, ISO standards may operate either as a sword-a negative standard used to challenge a domestic regulatory action-or a shield-an internationally agreed reference point that bolsters the legitimacy of a national measure. This Essay examines the potential for ISO standards on eco-labeling to act as swords to attack domestic requirements, and those on life cycle analysis to serve as shields to insulate municipal actions from international challenge in areas such as climate protection.","国际标准化组织（ISO）的14000系列等私营自愿性标准在鼓励企业主动采取更可持续的商业模式方面发挥着日益重要的作用，而非直接响应政府强制要求。ISO标准具有多重优势，包括促进国际统一性、提升企业内部对环境问题的重视、推动国际贸易，以及在监管体系欠完善的国家提供最低限度的环境绩效标准。对ISO标准的担忧则涉及与公共监管的关系，以及ISO 14001本质上偏重程序性而非基于绩效的特性。  . . 《北美自由贸易协定》（NAFTA）和《世界贸易组织技术性贸易壁垒协定》等国际贸易协议将ISO标准引入公共政策领域。由于这些协议的结构特点，ISO标准可能充当""利剑""——作为否定性标准挑战国内监管措施；也可能成为""盾牌""——作为国际公认的参考依据增强国家措施的合法性。本文探讨了生态标签类ISO标准作为""利剑""攻击国内要求的可能性，以及生命周期分析类标准在气候保护等领域充当""盾牌""、使地方行动免受国际质疑的潜力。","ISO environmental standards, environmental regulation, green policy, green standards",2009-02-05

In this brief we argue that regulatory analysis and foresight is an essential component of the successful transformation of the forest sector. As a first step to a regulatory analysis and foresight, we will illustrate here how to think about regulation based on the hindsight gleaned from the agricultural sector. Specifically we will derive lessons learned from the history of agricultural biofuels. A shift of energy production toward biofuels seems to support all of the three pillars of sustainable development. Accordingly, the most widely produced transport biofuel internationally, agricultural ethanol, has been marketed as a smart and green choice and as better alternative to oil-based gasoline.  This image is now crumbling somewhat. We will focus on lessons learned from the agricultural biofuels story (paying special attention to the case of ethanol) and explore what hindsight can teach us.",加拿大林业部门正面临重大转型时期。在本简报中，我们认为监管分析和前瞻性是林业部门成功转型的重要组成部分。作为监管分析和前瞻性的第一步，我们将在此说明如何基于农业部门的历史经验来思考监管问题。具体而言，我们将从农业生物燃料的历史中汲取经验教训。能源生产向生物燃料的转变似乎支持可持续发展的三大支柱。因此，国际上生产最广泛的运输用生物燃料——农业乙醇——一直被宣传为一种智能、绿色的选择，是优于石油基汽油的替代品。这种形象如今已有所动摇。我们将重点探讨农业生物燃料发展历程（特别关注乙醇案例）带来的启示，并探索历史经验能教会我们什么。,,2010-01-11

A regulatory arbitrage is the amount of capital requirement reduced by splitting a financial risk into several fragments, regulated via a risk measure separately. Coherent risk measures by definition are free of regulatory arbitrage;  dividing risks will not reduce the total capital requirement under a coherent risk measure. However, risk measures in practical use, such as the Value-at-Risk (VaR), are often not coherent and the magnitude of their regulatory arbitrage is then of significant importance. We quantify the regulatory arbitrage of risk measures in a rigorous mathematical framework, and categorize risk measures into three classes: free of regulatory arbitrage, of limited regulatory arbitrage, and of infinite regulatory arbitrage. We provide explicit results to characterize the regulatory arbitrage for general classes of risk measures, including distortion risk measures and convex risk measures.  Several examples of  risk measures of limited regulatory arbitrage are illustrated, as possible alternatives for coherent risk measures.",我们引入风险度量的监管套利概念，这是选择适用于银行监管的风险度量时需考量的关键因素之一。监管套利指通过将金融风险拆分为多个部分并分别用风险度量进行监管，从而减少的资本要求总额。根据定义，一致性风险度量不存在监管套利；在一致性风险度量下分割风险不会降低总资本要求。然而实际应用中的风险度量（如风险价值VaR）通常不具备一致性，其监管套利规模便具有重要意义。我们在严格数学框架下量化风险度量的监管套利，并将其划分为三类：无监管套利、有限监管套利和无限监管套利。针对包括失真风险度量与凸风险度量在内的广义风险度量类别，我们给出了刻画监管套利的明确结论。文中展示了若干具有有限监管套利的风险度量实例，作为一致性风险度量的潜在替代方案。,risk measures; regulatory arbitrage; subadditivity; Value-at-Risk; regulatory capital,2015-01-22

This Note will discuss one of the available defences to investment claims resulting from regulatory measures undertaken pursuant to public health, that of the doctrine of police powers. This doctrine recognises that reasonable governmental regulation does not result to compensable expropriation. This Note will further consider the challenges faced in the application of the police powers doctrine to the present pandemic situation.",新冠疫情不仅严重扰乱了公共卫生领域，也对全球经济造成重创。为此，多国政府相继出台防疫管控措施以遏制病毒传播，同时实施经济保护性复苏政策。由于这些措施涉及范围广、持续时间（目前）不确定，很可能引发受严重影响的外国投资者提出投资索赔。本文拟探讨基于公共卫生采取的监管措施所引发投资索赔的抗辩理由之一——警察权力原则。该原则认为合理的政府监管不构成可补偿的征收行为。本文还将进一步分析该原则在当前疫情形势下适用时面临的挑战。,"COVID-19, regulatory measures, police powers doctrine, investment treaty claims",2020-06-03

States have an incentive to free ride on the efforts of others. Yet around the globe national and sub-national governments are introducing regulatory measures to reduce emissions that can be fairly characterised as unilateral actions. The US and China, the world’s two largest emitters, are at the forefront. Indeed the evidence of states beginning to depart from business-as-usual behaviour raises the possibility that the characterizations of climate change as a Prisoner’s Dilemma may apply less strongly to the problem and that something else may be starting to happen. Accordingly, this paper considers: (i) to what extent nations are taking unilateral action to address climate change; and (ii) in the context of climate change, which is considered one of the greatest global collective action problems the world has faced, what are the possible economic explanations for nations to act in a unilateral fashion and what are the normative reasons for doing so.

While the PRC has incorporated many sound practices advocated by the BCPs, there are quite a few areas where significant differences can be observed with respect to qualification review of senior management, broader regulation at the product level, prescriptive rules, and guidance for risk management. Broadly speaking, the PRC adopts a rules-based approach to regulation; in many cases, regulations are prescriptive or even intrusive. In building a robust supervisory system, the PRC finds specific guidance more helpful than sole reliance on principles-based approaches. The paper argues that general principles and a principle-based approach to regulation do not seem to work well for emerging markets. Indeed, the current financial crisis has revealed some shortcomings in the existing international standards on banking supervision. Perhaps this standard can be improved by greater specificity and by incorporating more aspects of the experiences in emerging markets.",本文以银行业监管国际标准——《有效银行监管核心原则》（BCPs）为参照，探讨中华人民共和国（中国）的银行监管实践。中国虽已采纳该核心原则倡导的诸多良好做法，但在高管任职资格审查、产品层面更广泛的监管、规范性规则及风险管理指引等方面仍存在显著差异。总体而言，中国采用以规则为基础的监管方式，其监管规定往往具有强制性甚至干预性特征。在构建稳健监管体系过程中，中国发现具体指引比单纯依赖原则导向的监管更为有效。本文认为，通用性原则和原则导向的监管模式对新兴市场国家效果欠佳。当前金融危机已暴露出现行银行监管国际标准的若干缺陷。或许可通过增强规则具体性、吸纳更多新兴市场经验来完善这一标准。,"banking regulatory supervisory practices PRC, international standard banking supervision, basel core banking supervision, BCPs",2011-02-11

This research emphasizes that although regulatory attributes play a significant role, sector outcomes are also influenced by broader economic, geopolitical, and market dynamics beyond regulatory control. The analysis reveals that certain aspects of RG and RS have negligible impact on sector outcomes, highlighting the importance of understanding and addressing external factors such as circular debt, cross-subsidization practices, exchange rate inflation, and geopolitical shifts that significantly affect the sector's performance.

They held a common expectation that the regulatory reform, as a key element of structural reform, would enhance the corporate sector’s investment and infuse more competitive factors into their rigid market structure, and by doing so enable them to escape from the long-lasting economic recession. In a similar vein, the Abe Cabinet announced the promotion of regulatory reform as part of its growth strategy, in June 2013. This research, to begin with, examines the theoretical background and significance of the mitigation of social regulations conducted by the Koizumi Cabinet in the early and mid-2000s, and address why the Abe Cabinet's growth strategy stresses the mitigation of social regulations and launched regional- and firm-level regulatory reform alongside conventional measures.

For this reason, Congress is considering proposals that would require regulatory agencies to conduct regulatory impact analysis and subject it to judicial review. For judicial review to work, judges must be able to verify agency compliance with quality standards even if they are not experts in the subject matter the agencies deal with. This article demonstrates that courts could effectively review the quality of agencies’ regulatory impact analysis if they were given more concrete statutory guidance on what a regulatory impact analysis must include and the stringency with which a court will review that analysis. We propose a regulatory reform that would accomplish this goal: amend the Administrative Procedure Act to specify the main elements a regulatory impact analysis must include and clarify the standard of review by implementing a requirement that agencies use the best available evidence in their analysis.",监管机构在制定重大法规时，常以平庸的经济分析作为决策依据。为此，国会正审议相关提案，要求监管机构开展监管影响分析并接受司法审查。要使司法审查发挥作用，法官必须能够核实监管机构是否遵守质量标准，即便他们并非该机构所涉领域的专家。本文论证表明：若法律能更具体地规定监管影响分析必须包含的内容要素，并明确法院审查分析的严格标准，法庭就能有效评估监管机构分析报告的质量。我们提出一项可实现此目标的监管改革方案：修订《行政程序法》，明确规定监管影响分析的核心要素，并通过要求机构在分析中使用最佳可得证据来明确审查标准。,"regulatory impact analysis, judicial review, administrative procedure act, benefit-cost analysis, economic analysis",2017-04-17

Passage of the positive train control mandate in response to several high-profile train accidents amply illustrates how haphazardly the legislative branch can authorize regulations. Congressional hearings and committee reports on the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 contain no analysis of the causes and extent of the safety problem, alternative solutions, and the benefits and costs of alternatives to this $12.5 billion mandate.

Prior to reaching a preliminary decision, the agency and their independent science advisory panel are required to consider the “countervailing” effects a ban would have on smokers and non-smokers, including the creation of significant demand for contraband cigarettes. This monograph addresses the potential negative effects of a menthol ban by analyzing three facets of the contraband cigarette issue: 1) the nature of contraband cigarettes including consideration of how they may materially differ from legal products, such as by containing higher levels of heavy metals and other contaminants; 2) factors influencing the size of the contraband market and an estimation of how it would respond to a menthol ban; and 3) a discussion of the impacts of contraband cigarettes on society.  Academic literature, findings by US government and foreign government agencies, and accounts from major media publications serve as the databases for the analyses. The monograph concludes that a ban on menthol-flavored cigarettes would significantly inflate the market for contraband cigarettes, many of which present even higher health risks than legally-made products. The increased health hazards from illicit cigarettes disproportionately impact underage and African American smokers.","美国食品药品监督管理局（FDA）正考虑禁止薄荷味香烟。在做出初步决定前，该机构及其独立科学顾问小组必须评估禁令对吸烟者和非吸烟者可能产生的""抵消""效应，包括催生庞大的违禁香烟需求。本专题报告通过分析违禁香烟问题的三个层面，探讨薄荷禁令的潜在负面影响：1）违禁香烟的本质特征，包括其与合法产品可能存在的实质性差异（如重金属等污染物含量更高）；2）影响违禁市场规模的因素及对薄荷禁令可能作出的反应预测；3）违禁香烟对社会影响的讨论。分析基于学术文献、美国政府及外国政府机构的研究成果、主流媒体报道等资料。报告结论指出，薄荷味香烟禁令将大幅刺激违禁香烟市场，其中许多产品比合法产品的健康风险更高。违禁香烟增加的健康危害对未成年和非裔美国吸烟者造成尤为严重的影响。","tobacco, cigarettes, illicit, contraband, counterfeit, smuggled, organized crime, FDA. regulation, regulatory policies",2015-12-24

More recently, regulatory sandboxes have been presented as innovation-friendly instruments. This article contends that fostering responsible innovation through regulatory sandboxes presents significant challenges. First, there is no consensus on what the advancement of innovation entails, how to achieve it, and what the role of regulations and regulatory sandboxes should be in it. Second, there is a lack of clarity regarding the definition and functioning of regulatory sandboxes. Third, there is a risk of regulatory capture due to the close collaboration between regulators and regulatees.Drawing on Italy’s initial experiences with general and sector-specific regulatory sandboxes and existing scholarship on experimental regulatory instruments, this article contributes to the ongoing debate on regulation and innovation by critically examining the interplay between regulatory sandboxes and the promotion of responsible innovation.

New decisions and ICSID reform: The past three years have seen not only the most significant revision of the ICSID and ICSID Additional Facility (ICSID AF) arbitration rules in their history, but also a significant increase in the number of publicly available decisions on provisional measures.This study conducts a detailed examination of 160 decisions on provisional measures and how these decisions affect and change the trends and practices identified in the 2019 Report. These new decisions provide more clarity on the criteria used by tribunals to grant provisional measures and their understanding of such criteria, success rate by applicable arbitration rules and measures requested, as well as the cases most frequently relied upon by international tribunals. They also deal with some of most crucial issues facing investment arbitration at the moment, including the future of the intra-EU investor-state disputes, and the sanctions against Russia.Procedural efficiency: For the first time, this study explores the procedural efficiency of decisions on provisional measures, including the average number of days it takes for the tribunals to issue their decisions. It also shows how the choice of arbitration rules, the party making a request, and various other procedural factors affect the length of proceedings. It further investigates tribunals’ decisions on costs, and some of the most recent trends, including the increasing use of the “most provisional” decisions on provisional measures by ICSID tribunals, and recent amendments to the ICSID and ICSID Additional Facility Rules.For example, tribunals are more likely to grant provisional measures in cases with a hearing compared to cases without a hearing. On average, tribunals take 112 days to resolve the request for provisional measures, and UNCITRAL and ICSID Additional Facility tribunals are much more likely to do this within 100 days. In comparison, tribunals under the ICSID Rules typically take approximately 124 days to resolve such a request. This timing varies significantly depending on the type of the requested measure, the party making the request, and various procedural factors, such as the use of virtual or in-person hearings, and party-appointed witnesses and experts.Updating findings of the 2019 Report: Compared to the findings of the 2019 Report, respondent states have become increasingly willing to file requests for provisional measures, and much more likely to obtain a positive decision from tribunals. The study found no drastic changes in the types of the provisional measures requested by the parties, or the criteria applied by tribunals, except for an increase in the number of requests for the security for costs, and an increase in importance of the criterion of proportionality.","这项关于投资条约仲裁中临时措施的全面实证研究，建立在2019年临时措施报告（""2019年报告""）的成功基础上。原报告已被学术界广泛引用，并频繁出现在仲裁庭裁决和当事人关于临时措施的陈述中。本研究包含三部分内容：总结2019年报告发布后的关键新进展，探讨临时措施请求解决中的程序效率，以及根据新案例更新2019报告的结论。. .

It has also been associated in some studies with market consolidation. However, few studies have explicitly examined regulatory complexity and its association with greater market consolidation through the mechanism of higher compliance labor costs. This article examines regulatory complexity in several different sectors of the US economy and the associated share of labor in those sectors that is devoted to compliance activities. Next, it explores labor costs as a mechanism linking this regulatory complexity with market dynamics in that sector, such as market consolidation and large firms' share of revenue. Utilizing employment data from the US Census Bureau, this article finds that greater regulatory complexity is associated with a greater share of compliance vocations as a share of overall labor. It also examines the association between compliance share of total labor and market structure in the associated industry, finding that higher compliance spending is associated with industry consolidation. In doing so, this article helps to establish compliance share of labor as a useful alternative to direct measures of regulatory complexity, which are smaller and less frequently updated. It also highlights the importance of regulatory complexity in contributing to market structure dynamics, an important consideration for policymakers.",监管复杂性被普遍认为会增加额外的合规成本。一些研究还将其与市场集中化联系起来。然而，很少有研究明确探讨监管复杂性如何通过更高的合规劳动力成本机制导致市场集中化加剧。本文考察了美国经济中多个不同领域的监管复杂性，以及这些领域中从事合规活动的劳动力占比。接着，文章探讨了劳动力成本作为连接监管复杂性与该领域市场动态（如市场集中化和大型企业收入份额）的机制。利用美国人口普查局的就业数据，本文发现更高的监管复杂性与合规职业在总劳动力中占比增加相关。研究还检验了合规劳动力占比与相关行业市场结构之间的关联，发现更高的合规支出与行业集中化相关。通过这一分析，本文确立了合规劳动力占比作为衡量监管复杂性的有效替代指标——相比更新频率低、样本量小的直接测量方式。研究同时揭示了监管复杂性对市场结构动态的重要影响，这为政策制定者提供了关键考量依据。,"competition, market structure, regulation, regulatory complexity, regulatory burden, compliance costs",2025-06-05

These measures included quarantine or lockdown throughout the Italian territory, together with the revamping of hospitals, followed by economic recovery packages to address the standstill of the national economy. This Article focuses on the strengths and weaknesses of the Italian model. By highlighting the initial missteps, we can understand how this turned into a productive national and regional coordination model through a learning-by-monitoring process. However, the Italian model was implemented at a high cost, due to the overextension of executive action and the lack of territorial differentiation. After the President of the Italian Republic suggested stronger parliamentary involvement in the executive lockdown measures, the legislative branch began to give full legal force to the governmental provisional regulations. Rather than tailoring the regulatory measures according to the impacted regions, the government imposed a long and widespread lockdown throughout the country by means of an overregulation and bureaucratization of social life, which produced high human and economic costs for the country. In hindsight, the Italian government did not narrowly tailor the lockdown measures or lift them in those regions with limited infections. As a result, this widespread and micromanaged governmental action has created new and effective administrative processes of regional–national cooperation in public health, but it has also triggered distrust toward the way in which public authorities managed the pandemic during the different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.",全球所熟知的意大利抗疫模式，是2020年初该国政府为遏制肆虐北部地区——尤其是伦巴第、威尼托和皮埃蒙特——的致命病毒传播而采取的一系列措施。这些举措包括在全国范围内实施隔离封锁、升级医疗设施，随后推出经济复苏计划以应对国家经济停滞。本文重点探讨该模式的优劣。通过分析初期失误，我们可以理解其如何通过监测学习机制演变为高效的国家与地区协调体系。然而该模式实施代价高昂，源于行政权力的过度扩张及缺乏地域差异化措施。在意大利总统建议加强议会对封锁措施的监督后，立法机构开始为政府临时规章赋予完整法律效力。政府未根据疫情严重程度实施精准管控，反而通过过度监管和社会生活官僚化，在全国实施长期全面封锁，导致国家承受巨大的人力和经济损失。事后看来，政府既未精准制定封锁措施，也未及时解除低风险地区限制。这种全面微观管理模式虽催生了新型有效的央地公共卫生协作机制，但也引发了公众对疫情各阶段政府管控方式的不信任。,"COVID-19, lockdown measures, pandemic, Italian law, administrative law",2024-10-29
regulatory measures,RepeatedMeasuresCorrelation,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2833824,Jonathan Bakdash,"Repeated measures correlation (rmcorr) is a statistical technique for determining the common within-individual association for paired measures assessed on two or more occasions for multiple individuals. Simple regression/correlation is often applied to non-independent observations or aggregated data; this may produce biased, specious results due to violation of independence and/or differing patterns between-participants versus within-participants. Unlike simple regression/correlation, rmcorr does not violate the assumption of independence of observations. Also, rmcorr tends to have much greater statistical power because neither averaging nor aggregation is necessary for an intra-individual research question. Rmcorr estimates the common regression slope, the association shared among individuals. To make rmcorr accessible, we provide background information for its assumptions and equations, visualization, power, and tradeoffs with rmcorr compared to multilevel modeling. We introduce the R package (rmcorr) and demonstrate its use for inferential statistics and visualization with two example datasets. The examples are used to illustrate research questions at different levels of analysis, intra-individual and inter-individual. Rmcorr is well-suited for research questions regarding the common linear association in paired repeated measures data. All results are fully reproducible.",重复测量相关（rmcorr）是一种统计技术，用于确定多个个体在两个或更多时间点上评估的配对测量之间的共同个体内关联。简单回归/相关通常应用于非独立观测或聚合数据，由于违反独立性假设和/或参与者间与参与者内模式差异，可能导致有偏差的虚假结果。与简单回归/相关不同，rmcorr不会违反观测独立性的假设。此外，rmcorr通常具有更高的统计功效，因为针对个体内研究问题既不需要平均也不需要聚合数据。Rmcorr估计的是个体间共享的共同回归斜率关联。. . 为了让rmcorr更易于使用，我们提供了关于其假设条件、公式、可视化、统计功效以及与多层级建模比较的权衡背景信息。我们介绍了R包（rmcorr），并通过两个示例数据集演示其在推断统计和可视化中的应用。这些示例用于说明个体内和个体间不同分析层次的研究问题。Rmcorr非常适合研究配对重复测量数据中共同线性关联的问题。所有结果均可完全复现。,"correlation, regression, repeated measures, power, individual differences",2016-09-03

Yet the influence-seeking that targets these agencies remains poorly understood. Reporting exceptions under the Lobbying Disclosure Act allow many of the most powerful advocates to characterize their activity as lawyering, not lobbying, and thereby fly under the radar. Using agency-generated records on lobbying activity, financial reporting, and personnel databases specific to lawyers, as well as LinkedIn, we describe a vast subterranean world of regulatory influence-seeking that the social-science literature has (mostly) ignored. Regulatory lobbying is systematically different from legislative lobbying. It involves different kinds of people and different lobbying firms that bring specific forms of expertise and distinct networks. Our key findings about how regulatory lobbying differs include the following: (1) the regulatory lobbying sector is highly segregated from the reported lobbying sector, with many regulatory advocates failing to consistently register or report earnings commensurate with their activity level, (2) the number of unregistered regulatory advocates working on the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act plausibly exceeds 150% of the registered lobbyists working on that law, (3) the most effective regulatory lobbyists and law firms involved with regulatory lobbying have incomes that dramatically outpace leading reported lobbying firms (which are also mostly law firms), and (4) back-of-the-envelope calculations and more sophisticated decomposition regressions imply that aggregate expenditure on lawyer-lobbying is several multiples of reported lobbying spending.

regulatory measures,RegulatoryState with Dirigiste Characteristics: Variegated Pathways ofRegulatoryGovernance,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2157242,Kanishka  Jayasuriya,"The strength of the introductory chapter by Morgan and Dubash is in their clarion call to understand the specificities of the regulatory state in the global south. They ask us to give serious consideration to the notion that the regulatory state in the global south confronts issues, problems, and pathways of development which are different from those apparent in the highly Euro-centric literature on the regulatory state where it is portrayed almost as a triumph of a European mode of governance. From this point of view, this chapter and the various case studies represent a much needed corrective to this geographical bias. In fact, it represents more than the addition of the experience of the global south; it presents a much more complex and variegated view of the regulatory states than that suggested by the mainstream analyses. In this paper, I want to build on this insight, but also suggest that case studies in the volume implicitly point to an altogether different methodological understanding the regulatory state through the analysis of the process of regulatory state-building rather than through identifying the exceptional attributes of regulatory governance in the global south. Such a process oriented perspective to regulatory state-building throws into relief the problematic identification of regulatory types forcing us to more rigorously consider the primary set of processes that produce varieties of regulatory states in the global north and south. In this respect, the introductory chapter raised a nagging concern that the references to the global south should not fall into a kind of the modernisation problematic where the emerging regulatory state is seen as a response to a particular set of developmental constraints and patterns of regulatory governance, which are then benchmarked against the modal regulatory state in the global north. A thrust of this brief paper is that we need to get away from such ideal types, and focus more on the process of state and market formation by looking at regulatory governance and politics as an on-going process of state-building within systems of transnational markets and rule making. Of course, in making this criticism, I do not exempt my own work (see for example, Jayasuriya 2005) which tended to obscure the emerging varieties of regulatory state. Taking this tack of analysing the production of variation allows us to sail much more confidently into the murky seas of the relationship between neoliberalism or market-making and the regulatory state. Market-making and state-building projects have gone hand in hand, and for this reason their distinctive patterns in the global north as well as the global south require further analysis. From such a perspective, variations and experimentations of regulatory state structures and institutions are central to the process of market reform – or neoliberalism – in both the global north and south. The introductory chapter and the various case studies by and large stay clear of notions of neoliberalism, or if you prefer, programs of market. Yet, at the root of the development of regulatory forms is the attempt to constitute or enhance programs of marketization. In fact, this is a thread that runs through the various case studies ranging from water services in Columbiato telecommunication regulation in India. And in these chapters we see clearly that market building is at the core of the project of regulatory state-building. These two dimensions are irreparably bound. This is well exemplified – if not highlighted – in many of the case studies where the relationship between the politics of neoliberalism and regulatory state-building remains obscured. Hence what is overlooked in the various case studies is the fact that the processes of market reform – or neoliberalism – do not simply emerge from ‘nowhere’, but are contingent products of specific localised political and economic contexts. If market-making is about state-building, it follows that the nature of this relationship is shaped by the previous patterns of institution building and its privileged elites. In the section below we explore these processes of regulatory state-building and its variegated character by exploring three key areas: first, the embedding of patterns of market reform within previously dominant statist economic regimes that is the path dependence of the regulation; second, the extent to which this path dependence is modified by the transnationalisation of the state through mechanisms of multilevel governance; and finally how this multilevel governance results in a process of juridification of the regulatory state that shapes a distinctive form of politics.",摩根和杜巴什所撰导论章节的亮点，在于他们旗帜鲜明地呼吁人们关注全球南方监管型国家的特殊性。他们提请我们认真思考：全球南方监管型国家面临的发展议题、困境与路径，与高度欧洲中心主义的监管型国家文献所呈现的图景截然不同——这类文献几乎将监管型国家描绘为欧洲治理模式的胜利。从这个角度看，本章与各案例研究恰如其分地矫正了这种地理偏见。事实上，它不仅是补充了全球南方的经验，更呈现了比主流分析更为复杂多元的监管型国家图景。本文旨在深化这一洞见，同时指出书中案例研究隐含地指向一种截然不同的方法论认知——应通过分析监管型国家建构的进程，而非识别全球南方监管治理的特殊属性来理解监管型国家。这种以过程为导向的视角，使对监管类型的简单归类显得问题重重，迫使我们更严谨地思考那些造就全球北方与南方不同监管型国家的核心进程。就此而言，导论章节提出了一个亟待解决的忧虑：对全球南方的讨论不应陷入某种现代化问题框架，即把新兴监管型国家视为对特定发展约束和监管治理模式的回应，再以全球北方的标准监管型国家为标杆进行衡量。本文的核心论点是必须摒弃这类理想类型，转而聚焦国家与市场形成的过程，将监管治理与政治视为跨国市场体系和规则制定中持续进行的国家建构。当然，这种批评也包括笔者自身过往研究（如Jayasuriya 2005）——它们曾模糊了监管型国家的多样性。通过分析差异性的生成机制，我们能更从容地探索新自由主义/市场构建与监管型国家关系的混沌领域。市场构建与国家建设项目始终相辅相成，因此无论在全球北方还是南方，它们的独特模式都需要深入剖析。由此观之，监管型国家结构与制度的多样性和实验性，对全球南北方的市场改革（或曰新自由主义）进程都至关重要。导论章节与多数案例研究基本避开了新自由主义或市场化计划的提法。然而监管形式发展的根本动力，正在于建构或强化市场化计划的努力。事实上，从哥伦比亚水务到印度电信监管的各案例中，这一线索贯穿始终。这些章节清晰表明：市场建设是监管型国家建构项目的核心，二者密不可分。许多案例虽未明言却充分证明——新自由主义政治与监管型国家建构的关系始终晦暗不明。因此各案例研究忽略了一个事实：市场改革（或新自由主义）进程并非凭空产生，而是特定地方政治经济情境的产物。若市场构建即国家建设，那么这种关系的本质必然受既有制度建构模式及其特权精英的影响。下文将通过三个关键维度探讨监管型国家建构的进程及其多元性：首先，市场改革模式如何嵌入先前占主导地位的国家主义经济体制（即监管的路径依赖）；其次，这种路径依赖如何通过多层级治理机制被国家的跨国化所修正；最后，这种多层级治理如何导致监管型国家的司法化进程，从而塑造独特的政治形态。,"regulatory state, global south, multilevel governance, regulatory law, judicalisation of politics, regulatory politics",2012-10-12

We analyze whether regulatory arbitrage using lax enforcement of capital requirements was a motive for Japanese banks to continue loans to weak firms. We find evidence supporting the view that regulatory arbitrage was a motive of bad loans Two measures of regulatory arbitrage, the difference between the risk-based capital and the market-valued capital as a proportion of bank asset, and the subordinated debt as a proportion of bank asset, are useful in uncovering evidence that Japanese banks had the perverse incentive of extending bad loans in an attempt to inflate regulatory capital in the 1990s.",银行对弱势企业的宽容贷款是日本不良贷款问题长期存在的主要原因之一。我们分析了利用资本要求宽松执行进行监管套利是否是日本银行继续向弱势企业放贷的动机。研究发现支持监管套利是不良贷款动机的证据——两种监管套利衡量指标（风险资本与市值资本的差额占银行资产比例，以及次级债务占银行资产比例）有效揭示了日本银行在1990年代存在通过扩大不良贷款来虚增监管资本的扭曲动机。,"regulatory arbitrage, bad loans, capital requirements, accounting discretion",2014-06-09

regulatory measures,Changing Dimensions of Investor-State Dispute Settlement in India – Protecting theregulatorypower of the ‘Host-State’?,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4624704,Animesh Das,"Dispute settlement clauses in the recent Indian BITs are far more inclined towards shielding the states’ regulatory power by limiting the tribunals’ jurisdiction. The India-Brazil BIT in particular has moved a step ahead to seize the power from the arbitral tribunals in awarding compensations. Since the beginning, most of the Indian BITs contained both investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) and state-state dispute settlement (SSDS) clauses as investment dispute settlement mechanisms. But, for the first time, India signed a BIT with Brazil on terms that investment disputes shall be settled (or prevented) only through the SSDS mechanism. Furthermore, the current BIT regime in India is heavily guarded with several checkpoints, such as the absence of the most favoured nation clause, keeping taxation related measures outside the purview of BITs, the requirement to exhaust locally available remedies before invoking ISDS, etc. the list is long and includes several other similar provisions. In short, it signifies that India’s approach towards ISDS in particular, and investment protection in general, is a movement from a sceptical position in the past to a protectionist one in the present. Therefore, to justify the above claim, the paper will attempt to study the background of ISDS in India, analyse the jurisdictional scope of the arbitral tribunals, the practicability of the exhaustion of local remedies (ELR) clause and the power of the arbitral tribunals to award compensation in case of loss suffered by the investors. The paper concludes that India’s approach towards ISDS as contained in the Indian BITs (those are based on the new model) and especially in the India-Brazil BIT of 2020 proves to be a step to protect the regulatory power of the host-states.",近期印度双边投资条约中的争端解决条款更倾向于通过限制仲裁庭的管辖权来保护国家的监管权力。尤其是《印度-巴西双边投资条约》，更进一步剥夺了仲裁庭裁定赔偿的权力。从一开始，大多数印度双边投资条约就同时包含投资者-东道国争端解决机制（ISDS）和国家间争端解决机制（SSDS）作为投资争端解决方式。但印度首次在与巴西签署的条约中规定，投资争端仅能通过SSDS机制解决（或预防）。此外，当前印度的双边投资条约体系设置了多重限制，例如不包含最惠国待遇条款、将税收措施排除在条约适用范围之外、要求投资者在启动ISDS前用尽当地救济等，此类限制性条款不胜枚举。简言之，这表明印度对ISDS（尤其是）及投资保护（总体上）的态度，已从过去的怀疑立场转向如今的保护主义立场。为论证上述观点，本文将通过研究印度ISDS机制的背景、分析仲裁庭的管辖范围、用尽当地救济条款的可行性，以及仲裁庭裁定投资者损失赔偿的权限，最终得出结论：印度双边投资条约（基于新范本制定）特别是2020年《印度-巴西双边投资条约》中体现的ISDS立场，实质上是保护东道国监管权力的一种举措。,"BIT, ICSID, India, ISDS, Regulatory Powers",2023-11-29

Broadband is of increasing importance due to the digitalisation government services and of political processes, potentially excluding those without access from benefits and influence. Operators initially deliver new services in profitable areas, determined by the economics offensiveness, then more widely. Demands to accelerate and extend availability and to increase adoption generated modifications to legislation and regulations to increase investment incentives, plus the provision of state aid and the training of non-users.

As lawmakers, they determine the playing field of the agents in the markets and the decision powers of national regulators. Simultaneously, they are involved in appointing presidential chambers of national regulators. On the other hand, governments keep shares in regulated companies and support single infrastructure projects based on financial and legal state aid measures. Therefore, European Union regulatory frameworks require a strict separation of tasks between national ministries. However, the European Commission has repeatedly criticized member states for in-transparency and insufficient separations of tasks in national implementation. While the Second Regulatory Package balanced competition and investment aims, the new Regulatory Package implemented in December 2009 dedicates a higher weight to the role of infrastructure quality as a driver of service innovations. Moreover, national regulators become more independent, and former national regulation tasks are partially shifted to the pan-European level. In consequence, the role of governments also changes.

In the last century, though, the use of regulation by modern governments has grown markedly in both volume and significance, to the point where nearly every facet of today's economy is subject to some form of regulation.  When successful, regulation can deliver important benefits to society; however, regulation can also impose undue costs on the economy and, when designed or implemented poorly, fail to meet public needs at all.  Given the importance of sound regulation to society, its study by scholars of law and social science is also of paramount importance.  In this chapter, we review the state of the field by focusing on four major areas of empirical research: (1) regulatory policy making, (2) regulatory enforcement, (3) business responses to regulation, and (4) innovative models of regulation.  We begin by reviewing the political economy literature on the factors that influence government regulators as well as the ways that overseers may use administrative procedures to affect decisions of regulatory agencies.  We next highlight the varied empirical findings on adversarial versus cooperative enforcement styles.  We then review explanations for business responses to regulatory pressures, including the range of factors influencing compliance and beyond-compliance behavior.  Finally, we survey the ever-growing research literature on innovative approaches to regulation, including self-regulation, performance standards, and market-based incentives.  This chapter serves both as a stand-alone account of the existing state of empirical regulatory research by political scientists and researchers from other disciplines, as well as an introduction to the authors' edited volume that reprints a diverse collection of classic studies of regulation and regulatory processes.",对企业活动的监管几乎与法律本身一样古老。然而在上个世纪，现代政府对监管的运用在数量和重要性上都显著增长，以至于当今经济的几乎每个方面都受到某种形式的监管。成功的监管能为社会带来重要益处；然而，监管也可能给经济带来不当成本，若设计或执行不当，则完全无法满足公共需求。鉴于健全监管对社会的重要性，法学和社会科学学者对其研究也至关重要。本章我们聚焦实证研究的四大领域来梳理该领域现状：（1）监管政策制定，（2）监管执行，（3）企业对监管的应对，（4）创新监管模式。我们首先回顾政治经济学文献中关于影响政府监管机构的因素，以及监督者如何运用行政程序影响监管机构决策的研究。接着重点对比对抗性与合作性执法风格的实证发现。然后梳理企业对监管压力的反应机制，包括影响合规与超合规行为的各种因素。最后综述日益增长的创新监管研究，涵盖自我监管、绩效标准及市场化激励等方向。本章既是对政治学及其他学科学者现有实证监管研究的独立总结，亦作为作者编纂文集（收录多篇经典监管研究论文）的导论呈现。,"Administrative law, regulatory agencies, federal regulation, empirical research, regulatory policy making, regulatory enforcement, business responses to regulation, innovative models of regulation, self-regulation, performance standards, market-based incentives",2008-11-10

It highlights the importance of the design of efficient regulatory contracts in the context of changes facing the urban transportation industry in the European Union. Furthermore, it provides an overview of the main issues put forward in economic literature related to the design of regulatory contracts. It discusses several problems relevant in this context such as informational asymmetries, transaction costs, and regulatory capture. It also comments on a selection of views presented in economic literature dealing with these issues. Finally, the article presents the regulatory framework, contractual practices and characteristics of the French urban public transport industry. France is well known for its long standing tradition of contracting between the State and the private sector in transportation. The analysis of the French example may help to prove useful insights in this regard.",本文以城市公共交通行业为例，探讨了与最优监管合同设计相关的经济问题。文章强调了在欧盟城市交通行业面临变革的背景下，设计高效监管合同的重要性。此外，概述了经济学文献中提出的与监管合同设计相关的主要议题，讨论了信息不对称、交易成本和监管俘获等关键问题，并对经济学文献中针对这些问题的代表性观点进行了评述。最后，文章介绍了法国城市公共交通行业的监管框架、合同实践及行业特征。法国在交通领域公私合作方面具有悠久的传统，对其案例的分析可为该领域提供有益借鉴。,"contracts, informational asymmetries, regulatory capture, transaction costs, urban public transport",2017-02-12

Hahn,"To make prudent recommendations for improving the use of cost-benefit analysis in policy settings, some measures of how well it is actually done are essential. This paper develops new insights on the potential usefulness of government cost-benefit analysis by examining how it is actually performed. We assess the quality of a particularly rich sample of cost-benefit analyses of federal regulations. The data set we use for assessing the quality of regulatory analysis is the largest assembled to date for this purpose. The 55 analyses we examine span the Reagan administration, the first Bush administration and the Clinton administration. The paper is the first to assess systematically how government cost-benefit analysis has changed over time. There are three key findings. First, a significant percentage of the analyses in all three administrations do not provide some very basic economic information, such as information on net benefits and policy alternatives. For example, over 70 percent of the analyses in the sample failed to provide any quantitative information on net benefits. Second, there is no clear trend in the quality of cost-benefit analysis across administrations. Third, there is a great deal of variation in the quality of individual cost-benefit analyses.",为就如何在政策制定中更好地运用成本效益分析提出审慎建议，必须对其实际执行效果建立衡量标准。本文通过考察政府成本效益分析的实际操作情况，对其潜在效用提出了新见解。我们评估了一批特别详尽的联邦法规成本效益分析样本的质量，所用数据集是迄今为止为此目的构建的最大规模集合。所研究的55份分析报告跨越里根政府、老布什政府和克林顿政府时期。本文首次系统评估了政府成本效益分析随时间的演变趋势，得出三项关键发现：首先，三个政府时期均有相当比例的分析未提供诸如净效益和政策替代方案等最基本经济信息——例如样本中超过70%的分析未量化呈现净效益数据；其次，不同政府时期成本效益分析质量未呈现明显变化趋势；第三，个体分析报告质量存在显著差异。,"cost-benefit analysis, federal regulations, regulatory analysis",2004-04-04

Ohnesorge,"The societies of East Asia, which here refers to Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the People’s Republic of China (China), have followed a broadly similar path in adopting structures and methods of the regulatory state or regulatory capitalism,' a path which continues to influence the scope and functioning of regulatory government in the region. This chapter will outline that path, which, to generalize, preferred civil servants to judges and emphasized informal collaboration more than it did formal process, or, for that matter, conflict resolution. It highlights commonalities as well as differences among the countries within the region, and discusses historical, political, and economic underpinnings for that path. The chapter will also explore areas where that path differs most significantly from the trajectories of the United States and of Germany, the Western systems that have had the most influence in the region. Although all elements of the regulatory state model will be discussed in the East Asian context, focus will be on legal-institutional attributes such as independent regulatory agencies and rule-based governance rather than substantive policy choices such as privatization and deregulation, though this approach treats legal institutions and substantive policies as intimately related.",东亚社会，此处指日本、韩国、台湾地区及中华人民共和国（中国），在采纳规制国家或规制资本主义的结构与方法上遵循了大致相似的路径，这一路径持续影响着该地区规制政府的范围与运作。本章将概述这一路径——概括而言，它更青睐公务员而非法官，并更强调非正式协作而非正式程序或冲突解决。本章既突出该地区国家间的共性，也关注其差异，并探讨这一路径的历史、政治及经济基础。同时，本章还将深入分析该路径与美国及德国（对该地区影响最深的西方体系）发展轨迹差异最为显著的领域。尽管将在东亚语境下讨论规制国家模式的所有要素，但重点将集中于法律-制度属性（如独立监管机构与基于规则的治理），而非私有化与放松管制等实质性政策选择——尽管这一方法将法律制度与实质政策视为紧密关联。,"comparative law, regulatory institutions, legal institutions",2020-01-15

The large trading banks – those most plausibly ‘Too big to Fail’ – face the toughest tests. In contrast, we find no evidence that either political or regulatory connections affect the tests. Stress tests have a greater effect on the value of large trading banks’ portfolios; the large trading banks respond by making more conservative capital plans; and, despite their more conservative capital plans, the large trading banks still fail their tests more frequently than other banks.

regulatory measures,Toward a More Perfect Union:RegulatoryAnalysis and Performance Management,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1272076,Jerry Ellig,"Two separate but similar initiatives attempt to apply a scientific approach to improve government decision-making and results: performance management and regulatory analysis. Both initiatives seek to identify the nature of the problems government is trying to solve, develop alternative solutions, and evaluate the effectiveness and costs of the alternatives. Both require measurement of costs and outcomes. Both involve rigorous analysis to identify whether, and to what extent, government actions cause particular results to occur. Their analytical methods can be used ex ante, to evaluate alternative prospective courses of action, or ex post, to assess what consequences actually flowed from the alternative that was chosen and identify opportunities for improvement. Yet performance management and regulatory analysis rarely cross paths. Scholars who specialize in performance management tend to be in public administration or policy analysis departments; scholars who focus on regulatory analysis tend to be economists or lawyers. Ideologically, performance management is usually viewed as a means of making government more effective and customer-focused; regulatory analysis is often characterized as an attempt to throw sand in the gears of the regulatory state. For the U.S. government, the most prominent performance management directive is the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA).  The principal source of regulatory analysis mandates is Executive Order 12,866.  In federal agencies, the plans and reports mandated by GPRA are usually the responsibility of the chief financial officer or a senior official in charge of management. Regulatory analysis is usually the responsibility of a policy office that writes regulations or an economic analysis division. Even in the President's Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which oversees both performance management and regulatory analysis, responsibility is divided. GPRA guidance and other performance-related initiatives are under OMB's deputy director for management. Regulatory analysis is overseen by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). Due to these divisions, there are significant unexploited synergies between regulatory analysis and performance management. GPRA, and the performance-oriented practices it spawned, provide a vehicle to improve the quality of regulatory analysis in both executive branch and independent agencies. Similarly, the theory and practice of regulatory analysis suggests some opportunities to strengthen federal performance management in ways that more fully implement the spirit of GPRA. This Article explores the actual and potential linkages between regulatory analysis and performance management in theory and in practice.",两项独立但相似的举措试图运用科学方法来提升政府决策与成效：绩效管理与监管分析。两者都致力于厘清政府待解决问题的本质，制定备选解决方案，并评估方案的有效性与成本。它们均要求对成本与成果进行量化，都需要通过严谨分析来判断政府行为是否以及能在多大程度上引发特定结果。这些分析方法既可用于事前评估不同行动方案的预期效果，也可用于事后检验所选方案的实际成效并寻找改进空间。然而绩效管理与监管分析鲜少产生交集——绩效管理学者多来自公共行政或政策分析领域，监管分析研究者则多为经济学家或律师。意识形态层面，绩效管理常被视为提升政府效能与服务导向的工具，监管分析则常被刻画为阻碍监管国家运行的掣肘。  . . 在美国政府体系中，最著名的绩效管理指令是《政府绩效与成果法案》（GPRA），而监管分析的主要依据则是第12866号行政命令。联邦机构中，GPRA要求的计划与报告通常由首席财务官或管理事务高级官员负责，监管分析则由政策制定办公室或经济分析部门承担。即便在统筹这两项工作的总统管理与预算办公室（OMB）内部，职责也被分割：GPRA指南等绩效事务由OMB管理副主任分管，监管分析则由信息与监管事务办公室（OIRA）监督。  . . 这种分割导致监管分析与绩效管理之间存在大量未开发的协同效应。GPRA及其衍生的绩效实践为提升行政机构和独立机构的监管分析质量提供了载体；而监管分析的理论与实践经验，也为更全面贯彻GPRA精神、强化联邦绩效管理提供了可能路径。本文将从理论与实践层面，探讨监管分析与绩效管理之间现有及潜在的关联。,"performance management, regulatory review, oira, regulation, benefit-cost, gpra, omb",2008-09-23

These objectives may however not be met. In this paper however, we present the regulatory outcomes of Namibia’s communications regulatory framework. We studied the performance of the two dominant and publicly owned telecommunications corporations. We assessed how the national institutional endowment in relation to the regulatory governance and regulatory incentives, such as benchmarking, influenced the performance of the telecommunications sector. We use this analysis to explain the effectiveness of the regulatory framework in achieving the regulatory purpose. One of the major findings of the study was that the roles of the Minister of ICT, as policy maker and as shareholder representative over the dominant public operator Telecom Namibia Limited (TN) are in conflict. There is a concentration of the telecommunications market, with the exit of the only privately owned mobile cellular operator.

This experiment, if successful, could have important implications for reviewing the impact of regulation across the world. Five government reports on the costs and benefits of regulation are now complete. We offer a critical evaluation of these reports, using an approach that scores the reports on various dimensions. By and large, the reports represent a significant step forward in providing insights into the regulatory process and in providing information on the costs and benefits of regulation. But they also illustrate the shortcomings of having a government agency do the analysis. We recommend that the Office of Management and Budget require agencies to issue a scorecard evaluating each agency regulation; that OMB summarize the strengths and weaknesses of regulations using this scorecard; that OMB include not only executive agencies, but also independent agencies in its analysis; and that Congress create an agency or office outside of the executive branch to perform a regulatory evaluation function similar to that of OMB.

Regulators are expected to protect the public from harms associated with economic activity and technological change without unduly impeding economic growth or efficiency. Regulators today also face new demands, such as adapting to rapidly changing and complex financial instruments, the emergence of the sharing economy, and the potential hazards of synthetic biology and other innovations. Faced with these challenges, regulators need a lodestar for what constitutes high-quality regulation and guidance on how to improve their organizations’ performance. In the bookAchieving Regulatory Excellence, leading regulatory experts across various disciplines seek to provide the guidance regulators so often lack, and to elucidate what it means to be an excellent regulator. This introductory chapter sets the stage for defining regulatory excellence by clarifying regulators’ primary challenges, functions, and ultimate goals. The chapter also emphasizes that even though regulation is widely associated with technical expertise, excellent regulators must also focus on “people excellence” by building an internal culture that fosters and reinforces humility, openness, empathy, and a steadfast commitment to public service.","监管是一项高风险的事业，充满巨大挑战和持续不断的公众压力。监管者既要保护公众免受经济活动和技术变革带来的危害，又不能过度阻碍经济增长或效率。当今监管者还面临诸多新要求，例如适应快速变化且复杂的金融工具、共享经济的兴起，以及合成生物学等创新技术带来的潜在风险。面对这些挑战，监管者需要明确高质量监管的标准，并获取提升组织绩效的指导。在《实现卓越监管》一书中，来自各领域的顶尖监管专家试图提供监管者普遍缺乏的指导，并阐释卓越监管者的内涵。本章作为开篇，通过厘清监管者的核心挑战、职能和终极目标，为定义监管卓越性奠定基础。本章同时强调，尽管监管常被视为技术性工作，但卓越的监管者还必须注重""人的卓越性""，通过培育谦逊、开放、共情和坚定公共服务信念的组织文化来实现这一目标。","Administrative law, regulation, regulatory excellence, quality management, regulatory performance, public value, problem-solving, human capital, governmental improvement, public policy and administration",2020-07-02

Results: Participants with weak unhealthy snacking habits consumed more healthy snacks when forming implementation intentions (regardless of match or mismatch with their regulatory orientation), while participants with strong unhealthy snacking habits consumed more healthy snacks only when forming implementation intentions that matched their regulatory orientations. Conclusion: Results suggest that implementation intentions that match regulatory orientation heighten motivation intensity and put snacking under intentional control for people with strong unhealthy snacking habits.",目的：本研究探讨了将执行意向与个体的调节定向相匹配是否会影响改变不健康零食习惯的效果。设计：测量（作为长期特质）或操纵（作为情境状态）参与者的调节定向，并随机分配参与者至执行意向条件，即多食用健康零食或避免食用不健康零食。主要结果指标：通过两天的在线食物日记自我报告健康与不健康零食的摄入情况。结果：不健康零食习惯较弱的参与者在形成执行意向后（无论是否与其调节定向匹配）会摄入更多健康零食，而不健康零食习惯较强的参与者仅在执行意向与其调节定向匹配时才会摄入更多健康零食。结论：结果表明，对于不健康零食习惯较强的个体，与其调节定向匹配的执行意向能增强动机强度，使零食摄入行为处于意向控制之下。,"snacking habits, implementation intentions, regulatory fit, regulatory focus",2010-01-12
regulatory measures,Do Agencies Consider Distribution and Equity in their Rules?,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4768079,Mark Febrizio,"Since 1993, Executive Order 12866 has required agencies not only to conduct analysis of the benefits and costs of “significant” regulatory actions but also to consider “distributive impacts and equity” in selecting among regulatory alternatives. How often, and in what manner, have agencies complied with this requirement? A growing literature on existing agency practices on distributional analysis of regulations generally finds that federal agencies do not fully account for the distribution of benefits and costs in their final rules. However, existing studies focus on a relatively small sample of rules, rather than capturing the broader frequency of how agencies consider distribution and equity, even if partially or informally. Establishing such a baseline of historical agency practice will lay a foundation for future assessments of the Biden administration’s initiative to reinvigorate distributional analysis. To fill this research gap, this paper uses text analysis tools to examine the regulatory preambles of significant final rules published in the Federal Register from 1994 to 2021. After developing quantitative estimates of the frequency with which agencies include distributional considerations in their analysis, the paper conducts descriptive and statistical analysis of the data and finds that while distributional analysis is relatively uncommon, it has become more common over time and differs considerably by agency.","自1993年以来，第12866号行政命令要求各机构不仅要对""重大""监管行动的效益和成本进行分析，还要在选择监管方案时考虑""分配影响和公平性""。各机构在多大程度上以何种方式遵守了这一要求？关于现行监管分配分析的文献普遍发现，联邦机构在最终规则中并未充分考量效益与成本的分配情况。然而现有研究仅聚焦于少量规则样本，未能全面反映机构考虑分配与公平问题的整体频率——即使这种考量是部分或非正式的。建立此类历史实践基准数据，将为评估拜登政府重振分配分析举措的未来研究奠定基础。为填补这一研究空白，本文运用文本分析工具检视了1994至2021年间《联邦公报》发布的重大最终规则序言部分。通过量化统计机构分析中包含分配考量的频率，本文对数据进行描述性与统计性分析后发现：尽管分配分析整体占比不高，但其应用频率随时间推移逐渐上升，且不同机构间存在显著差异。","distribution, equity, regulation, regulatory impact analysis, text analysis",2024-04-15

Such investment patterns make the continuous operation, maintenance and development of the early warning infrastructure a challenging task and may lead to sub-optimal investment decisions. The paper presented here proposes an economic assessment model for the tangible economic impact of early warning systems. The model places a focus on the false alert problematic and goes beyond previous approaches by incorporating some socio-cultural factors (qualitatively estimated as of now).

early warning systems,Predicting Retail Customers' Distress:EarlyWarningSystemsand Machine Learning Applications,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4730470,Jaap Beltman,"Predicting credit defaults is crucial for financial institutions to assess risk and make informed lending decisions. One of the most recent strategies banks and financial institutions have been testing to minimize loses that arrise from credit default is the deployment of Early Warning Systems (EWS). By nature this technique was primarily proposed and have been explored for commercial customers, however, this study aims to propose a comprehensive data-driven approach to model Early Warning Systems (EWS) for retail customers in the financial industry while using different Machine Learning (ML) models. We use Logistic Regression (LR), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Random Forest (RF) to classify customers status, indicating the need to include potential default in a ```watch list"". Additionally, we implement a fourth model (i.e., meta-model), which predictions are based on the output of the other algorithms used (LR, GB, RF). Results have shown that the RF achieves an average Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.775, while GB and LR reach 0.750, and our proposed model outperforms these algortihms with an AUC of 80\%. From a managerial standpoint, the data analysis suggest that setting a higher threshold for warning signals leads to notifications that are closer to the overdue date, showing a heightened sensitivity to the early signs of client deterioration. In contrast, lower criteria prioritize the client's overall condition. In addition, utilizing the top ten features for training produces satisfactory overall outcomes. However, integrating features beyond the top ten offers useful supplemental data to aid in the decision-making process.","预测信贷违约对金融机构评估风险和做出明智贷款决策至关重要。银行和金融机构近期为减少信贷违约损失而测试的最新策略之一是部署早期预警系统(EWS)。该技术最初主要针对商业客户提出并探索，但本研究旨在为金融行业零售客户建立早期预警系统提出全面的数据驱动方法，同时运用不同机器学习(ML)模型。我们采用逻辑回归(LR)、梯度提升(GB)和随机森林(RF)对客户状态进行分类，以识别需要列入""观察名单""的潜在违约客户。此外，我们还构建了第四种模型（即元模型），其预测基于其他算法（LR、GB、RF）的输出结果。实验表明，RF模型的平均曲线下面积(AUC)为0.775，GB和LR模型为0.750，而我们提出的模型以80%的AUC值优于这些算法。从管理角度看，数据分析表明设定更高的预警信号阈值会使通知更接近逾期日期，显示出对客户状况恶化的早期迹象具有更高敏感性；而较低标准则更关注客户整体状况。此外，使用前十项特征进行训练可获得满意结果，但整合前十项之外的特征能为决策过程提供有价值的补充信息。","Early Warning Systems, Machine Learning, Meta-model, Retail Customers, Finance",2024-03-08
