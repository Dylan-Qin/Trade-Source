The World Trade Organization’s (WTO) most recent Ministerial Conference took place last December in Nairobi, Kenya. Opinions vary on how much was achieved, and, perhaps more importantly, where the WTO goes from here. The United States and the European Union have emphasized that “new” issues and approaches should guide WTO negotiations in the future. But it is not clear what that means, and how it relates to the “old” issues and approaches. And with the rise of mega-regional trade negotiations, such as the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), there are serious questions about the WTO’s role as a negotiating forum for trade liberalization. This paper reviews the current WTO negotiating agenda and the Nairobi outcomes, discusses possibilities for new directions, and makes suggestions for the WTO going forward.

世界贸易组织（WTO）最近一次部长级会议于去年12月在肯尼亚内罗毕举行。各方对会议取得的成果众说纷纭，而更关键的问题或许在于WTO今后的发展方向。美国和欧盟强调，"新"议题和新方法应指导WTO未来的谈判。但这具体意味着什么，与"旧"议题和方法有何关联，目前尚不明确。随着跨太平洋伙伴关系协定（TPP）和跨大西洋贸易与投资伙伴关系协定（TTIP）等大型区域贸易谈判的兴起，WTO作为贸易自由化谈判论坛的角色也面临严峻质疑。本文审视了WTO当前的谈判议程和内罗毕会议成果，探讨了未来发展方向的可能性，并为WTO的前进道路提出建议。
