The Doha Round negotiation mandate of the World Trade Organization (WTO) proposes to minimise trade distortions and commercial displacement under the cover of international food aid, without preventing genuine food aid from reaching people in need. This paper presents problematic aspects of international food aid for trade and competition and an overview of the international governance of food aid. The latest available Draft Modalities for Agriculture (December 2008) are seen as being only halfway successful in implementing the Doha mandate. A new text with better-targeted disciplines and a political food aid commitment are proposed as part of the Doha Round Final Act.

世界贸易组织（WTO）多哈回合谈判的授权提出，要在不妨碍真正粮食援助送达需要人群的前提下，尽量减少以国际粮食援助为幌子造成的贸易扭曲和商业替代。本文阐述了国际粮食援助对贸易和竞争造成的问题层面，并概述了国际粮食援助治理现状。2008年12月发布的最新《农业谈判模式草案》被认为仅部分实现了多哈授权目标。作为多哈回合最终法案的组成部分，本文建议出台包含更具针对性纪律条款的新文本，并作出政治性的粮食援助承诺。
