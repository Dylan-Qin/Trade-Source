This paper associates warning indicators with risk events and uses distance entropy to calculate the comprehensive risk value. Using the POT model to calculate the comprehensive dynamic warning threshold, and constructing a warning decision and control model. Taking the K2 tunnel as an example for empirical analysis, control project safety construction from two aspects: safety risk monitoring and safety management supervision. The effectiveness of the POT control chart method for dynamic warning of risk events has been confirmed, filling the gap of single indicator warning. The dynamically changing warning threshold reflects the project's safety control capability.

本文通过将预警指标与风险事件关联，利用距离熵计算综合风险值，采用POT模型计算综合动态预警阈值，构建预警决策与控制模型。以K2隧道为例进行实证分析，从安全风险监测与安全管理监督两方面管控项目安全施工。验证了POT控制图法对风险事件动态预警的有效性，填补了单一指标预警的空白。动态变化的预警阈值反映了工程安全管控能力。
