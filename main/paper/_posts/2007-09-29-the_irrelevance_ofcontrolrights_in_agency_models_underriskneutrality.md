The allocation of control rights is a key issue in incomplete contracts. In this paper, we add an exit option, the right of early termination, to the standard agency model for employment contracts. We address two questions: (1) Who should have this right? (2) What is the effect of its inclusion in a contract? Under risk neutrality, we find that (1) it does not matter for investments and economic efficiency to whom this right belongs, although it may affect con-tractual terms and income sharing, and (2) although the allocation of this right does not mat-ter, its inclusion can have either a positive or a negative effect on economic efficiency. Our analysis provides a benchmark for more general studies on control rights under risk aversion.

控制权的分配是不完全合同中的一个关键问题。本文在标准雇佣合同代理模型中引入了退出选择权——提前终止权。我们探讨了两个问题：（1）谁应拥有这一权利？（2）将该权利纳入合同会产生何种影响？在风险中性条件下，我们发现：（1）该权利归属对投资和经济效率无实质影响，尽管可能改变合同条款与收入分配；（2）虽然权利分配方式无关紧要，但该权利的引入可能对经济效率产生正向或负向影响。本研究为风险厌恶条件下控制权更广泛的研究提供了基准框架。
