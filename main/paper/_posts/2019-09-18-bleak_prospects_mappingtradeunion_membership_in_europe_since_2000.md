This report details shifts in trade union membership and density in 32 European countries since 2000, with a particular focus on the age structure within trade unions. The report uncovers substantial variations in unionisation rates, with the least unionised countries in the 2000s having largely stayed at the bottom of the 'unionisation league' in the 2010s and countries with higher incidences maintaining their positions further up. Overall, however, membership and density rates are declining in most countries, particularly Central and Eastern Europe, and they are also ‘greying’. With the loss in membership going hand in hand with a decrease in revenues, it remains to be seen how and to what extent trade unions will address the membership and generational challenges.

本报告详述了自2000年以来32个欧洲国家工会会员人数及密度的变化趋势，尤其关注工会内部的年龄结构。研究发现各国工会化率存在显著差异：21世纪初工会化程度最低的国家在2010年代仍基本处于"工会化排名"末端，而原有较高工会化率的国家则继续保持领先地位。但总体而言，大多数国家的工会会员人数和密度正在下降，中欧和东欧地区尤为明显，同时会员群体也呈现"老龄化"特征。随着会员流失与收入减少相伴而生，工会将如何应对会员数量与代际更替的双重挑战，其具体措施及成效仍有待观察。
