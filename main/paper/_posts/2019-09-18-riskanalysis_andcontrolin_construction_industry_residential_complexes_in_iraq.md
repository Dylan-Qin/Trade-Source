在建筑行业中，风险管理是项目成功的重要因素，多种风险可能影响项目（技术、财务、社会、商业、政治及自然风险）。本研究涵盖了建筑行业风险管理的概念，并回顾了项目生命周期中风险的分析与控制方法。研究基于伊拉克建筑行业风险管理调查结果，重点关注三类风险（时间、财务及外部因素），问题在于未因风险发生而预留额外工期，且缺乏可覆盖风险处理的额外资金预算。结果显示，（企业、承包商、工程师及政府）在风险管理方式上存在明显滞后，缺乏应对的方法论与经验，该领域研究不足，缺少培训项目与课程，未引入国际专家资源，选择了不合格企业与承包商，在不稳定地区作业，以及资金预算短缺。政府对油气行业的侧重与依赖导致伊拉克建筑业受到负面影响。据此，研究提出了可改变建筑项目风险管理现状的重要建议。
