We provide an introduction and overview to the field of risk management for interested non-specialists, with a particular focus on the data and information requirements. Data for risk management come in many forms, and the applications of risk information for managing credit, market, operational, and liquidity risk are diverse. After an introductory overview of risk, uncertainty, and information, we survey the basic data and measurement issues in the context of some specific combinations of risk types and asset classes. The survey includes detailed recommendations for further reading on particular topics.

我们为感兴趣的非专业人士提供风险管理领域的介绍和概述，尤其关注数据与信息需求。风险管理数据形式多样，风险信息在信用风险、市场风险、操作风险和流动性风险管理中的应用也各不相同。在初步概述风险、不确定性和信息之后，我们针对特定风险类型与资产类别的组合，探讨了基本数据与计量问题。本概述包含针对特定主题的延伸阅读详细建议。
