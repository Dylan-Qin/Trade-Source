This paper charts the evolution and diversification of trade in knowledge that has taken place in the quarter-century since the WTO TRIPS Agreement came into force. Entirely new markets have come into being, potentially redefining the very character of 'trade'. The disruptive effect of digital technology has led to much of the content - formerly conceived of as 'added value' embedded in physical carrier media, traded and measured as 'goods' – can be traded in the form of specific licences that use IP rights covering the content that is increasingly accessed online in digital form.These new forms of exchange in valuable intangible content confront fundamental assumptions about the nature of trade and its interaction with the IP system, forcing a rethink of what constitutes the 'trade-related aspects' of intellectual property. The issues examined include the principle of territoriality of IP rights and the segmentation of markets according to national jurisdictions; the structuring of cross-border commercial exchanges into the two discrete categories of 'goods' and 'services'; the emerging disparity in regional trade agreements between provisions on digital IP standards and on digital products and e-commerce; and the significance of IP rights being treated as assets in investment treaties. Whatever formal or legal overlay is applied to these new trading arrangements – it is essential to understand that this is now trade in IP licences as such, rather than trade in goods that have an IP component as an adjunct or ancillary element. TRIPS came about at a time when economic growth theory incorporated intangible knowledge as an endogenous factor, rather than maintaining it as exogenous to models of growth. Trade policy must similarly work to incorporate an understanding of the trade in IP licences itself within cross-border commercial exchanges as an integral element of international trading relations: sale and licensing of IP rights can then be considered 'endogenous' to trade. This is essential for an accurate empirical picture of trade relations today, given the economic significance both of dispersed global value chains and of trade in 'pure' IP content as such particularly in the creative sectors.

本文追溯了自WTO《与贸易有关的知识产权协定》(TRIPS)生效二十五年来，知识贸易的演变与多元化进程。全新市场的诞生正在重新定义"贸易"的本质特征。数字技术的颠覆性影响使得大量内容——传统上被视为嵌入实体载体媒介的"附加值"，以"货物"形式进行贸易和计量——现在可以通过特定许可形式进行交易，这些许可利用的正是日益以数字化形式在线获取的内容所涉及的知识产权。这些无形高价值内容的新型交易方式，对贸易本质及其与知识产权体系互动的基本假设提出了挑战，迫使人们重新思考知识产权的"与贸易相关的方面"究竟包含哪些要素。. . 研究涉及的问题包括：知识产权地域性原则与按国家司法辖区划分的市场分割；将跨境商业交换机械划分为"货物"和"服务"两大类的结构性问题；区域贸易协定中数字知识产权标准条款与数字产品及电子商务条款之间日益显现的差异；以及知识产权在投资条约中被视为资产的重要意义。无论对这些新型贸易安排施加何种形式或法律层面的规范——关键在于认识到这本质上已是知识产权许可本身的贸易，而非附带知识产权成分的货物贸易。TRIPS协定诞生时，经济增长理论正将无形知识作为内生因素纳入，而非继续将其视为增长模型的外生变量。贸易政策同样需要将知识产权许可贸易本身作为跨境商业交换的内在要素纳入国际经贸关系：知识产权的销售与许可由此可被视为贸易的"内生"组成部分。鉴于全球价值链的分散分布与"纯"知识产权内容贸易（尤其在创意产业领域）的经济重要性，这种认知对准确描绘当今贸易关系的实证图景至关重要。
