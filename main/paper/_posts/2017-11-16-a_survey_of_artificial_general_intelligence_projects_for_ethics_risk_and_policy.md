Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is AI that can reason across a wide range of domains. It has long been considered the “grand dream” or “holy grail” of AI. It also poses major issues of ethics, risk, and policy due to its potential to transform society: if AGI is built, it could either help solve the world’s problems or cause major catastrophe, possibly even human extinction. This paper presents the first-ever survey of active AGI R&D projects in terms of ethics, risk, and policy. A thorough search identifies 45 projects of diverse sizes, nationalities, ethical goals, and other attributes. Most projects are either academic or corporate. The academic projects tend to express goals of advancing knowledge and are less likely to be active on AGI safety issues. The corporate projects tend to express goals of benefiting humanity and are more likely to be active on safety. Most projects are based in the US, and almost all are in either the US or a US ally, including all of the larger projects. This geographic concentration could simplify policymaking, though most projects publish open-source code, enabling contributions from anywhere in the world. These and other findings of the survey offer an empirical basis for the study of AGI R&D and a guide for policy and other action.

通用人工智能（AGI）是一种能在广泛领域进行推理的AI技术，长期以来被视为AI领域的"终极梦想"或"圣杯"。由于其变革社会的潜力，AGI也引发了伦理、风险和政策方面的重大议题：若成功研发，它既能助力解决全球性问题，也可能引发重大灾难甚至导致人类灭绝。本文首次针对活跃的AGI研发项目开展了伦理、风险及政策维度的调查研究。通过全面检索共识别出45个规模、国籍、伦理目标各异的项目，其中多数属于学术机构或企业。学术项目多以推动知识进步为目标，较少关注AGI安全性问题；企业项目则更强调造福人类，且更注重安全研发。大多数项目位于美国，几乎所有项目都集中在美国或其盟国境内（包括全部大型项目）。这种地域集中性可能简化政策制定流程，不过多数项目开源代码的特性允许全球各地参与贡献。这些调查结果为AGI研发研究提供了实证基础，也为政策制定等行动提供了指引依据。
