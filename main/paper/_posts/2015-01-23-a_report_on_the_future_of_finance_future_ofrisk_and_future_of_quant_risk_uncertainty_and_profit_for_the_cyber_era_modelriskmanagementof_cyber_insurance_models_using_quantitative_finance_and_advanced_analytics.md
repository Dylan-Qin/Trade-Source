Background: This body of work represents the first thesis to advance Finance Quantitative Methods, Quantitative Finance and Fintech Modeling R&D to the AI-ML-Quant-Cyber-Crypto-Quantum-Risk-Computing Era. The Current Post-Doctoral Research Thesis On Finance, Quant, and Risk Modeling beyond the Global Financial Crisis is based upon synthesizing post-crisis Quantitative Finance, Computer Science, Network & Computer Security Engineering R&D. It proposes pioneering Crypto-era Cyber-Finance-Trust Engineering frameworks advancing upon the first Digital Transformation Social Networks Quant Modeling PhD thesis that pioneered post-WWW Digital Quant-IT-Finance-Controls-Risks, Decentralized Control Models, and, Digital-Social Knowledge-Assets R&D.PrefaceComing from an Engineering background as a Chartered Engineer, I led global Banking & Finance modeling and development projects for largest US and worldwide banks. I also led modeling and implementation projects for the Big-3 IT firm on which hundreds of global Banking & Finance firms relied as a key global financial systems provider. Then, I earned a quantitative PhD with 2xPhD Credits from Top-10 PhD Program and subsequently taught as Associate Professor and Assistant Professor of Quantitative Methods at Syracuse University with research focus on quantitative risk modeling. Just before the Global Financial Crisis, my research was surfacing critical questions about the model risk inherent in Financial Engineering models. For instance, I made reference to it in an interview by a UK based global management research publisher in 2005.Those questions were about the compatibility of deterministic and stochastic models of natural sciences with the increasingly non-deterministic, i.e., uncertain, sociotechnical post-WWW digitally social networked world. Those questions were also about the capacity of deterministic and stochastic Financial Engineering risk models to cope with increasing uncertainty characterizing a rapidly and dynamically changing digital world. Those questions led me to post-doctoral research in Quantitative Finance leading to working for top Wall Street investment banks such as JP Morgan Private Bank in midtown Manhattan. My technical and applied hands-on leadership guiding JP Morgan top executives and MDs focused on advancing their advanced Quantitative Finance risk modeling and analytics. I focused on guiding their financial risk modeling beyond quantitative models that had become targets of criticism given association with large-scale financial failures over the span of the Global Financial Crisis.After concluding those Quantitative Finance projects, I continued to further advance related post-doc research in Computational Finance and Cybersecurity. While conducting research on rapidly increasing Cyber risk in Banking and Finance domains with emergency warnings coming from the White House, US Treasury, Department of Homeland Security, and, Office of Comptroller of Currency, this thesis was born. It was born out of the observation about the specific risk models blamed for the Global Financial Crisis which nearly drove US investment banks to extinction. The same models were now becoming the predominant models of choice by commercial providers for cyber risk and cyber insurance related modeling for estimation of potential cyber risk related financial loss….AbstractQuantitative modeling of cyber risk for cyber insurance modeling is at a nascent stage characterized by sparse empirical research and reliable data. Our current investigation reveals that VaR, short for Value-at-Risk (Jorion, 2006), is the current predominant model of choice for cyber insurance modeling. Model risk related to VaR was a key factor in the Global Financial Crisis given its known limitations in modeling tail risks and systemic risks (Haldane & Nelson, 2012; Malhotra, 2012, 20141). As a result, US Federal Reserve and OCC issued model risk compliance guidance for US financial institutions (US Fed & OCC, 2011). Basel Committee of worldwide central bank supervisors stopped relying on VaR for risk modeling (BCBS, 2013). Given history of model risks associated with VaR, we investigate if current reliance of cyber insurance modeling on VaR entails model risk. We develop qualitative frameworks to benchmark relative levels of tail risks and systemic risks associated with cyber risk vis-à-vis financial risks typically modeled with VaR. Our analysis reveals that cyber risk entails exponentially higher tail risks and systemic risks thus making VaR unfit for reliance as the primary risk model for cyber insurance modeling. We develop specific frameworks of model risk management (Derman, 1996; Morini, 2011) for cyber insurance modeling and demonstrate their empirical application in model risk management. We distinguish between model risks arising from the choice of specific quantitative models from those arising from the choice of quantitative methodologies. We demonstrate how to manage model risks associated with VaR using it with multiple simple and advanced models to cross-check its reliability. We also offer alternative coherent risk measures as better alternatives to VaR and empirically demonstrate their application. To enable further minimization of model risk in cyber insurance modeling we do three more things. First, we analyze the Bayesian quantitative statistical inference methodology as a possible alternative to frequentist classical inference methodology that VaR and advanced models typically rely upon. Second, we analyze the Markov Chain Monte Carlo models and related Gibbs Sampling and Metropolis-Hastings statistical computing algorithms to enable the use of Bayesian methodology. Finally, given increasing uncertainty in cyber risk modeling and management, we develop a framework for enabling Knightian uncertainty management (Knight, 1921) relating it to model risk management.ContributionsTo avert the impending national Cyber risk and Cyber-insurance disaster based upon large-scale commercial reliance upon quantitative models with inherent model risks, tail risks, and systemic risks in current form, this dissertation makes the following key contributions.▪ First, we develop the first known Cyber-Finance-Trust framework for Cyber insurance modeling to analyze how finance risk entangled with Cyber risk further exacerbates the systemic, interdependent, and correlated character of Cyber risks.▪ Second, we develop the first known model risk management framework for Cyber insurance modeling as model risk management has received sparse attention in Cyber risk assessment and Cyber insurance modeling.▪ Third, our review of quantitative models in Cyber risk and Cyber insurance modeling develops the first known analysis establishing significant and extreme model risks, tail risks, and, systemic risks related to predominant models in use.▪ Fourth, we develop an empirical study of VaR and Bayesian statistical inference methodologies with specific guidance for containing model risks by applying multiple simple and advanced models for cross-checking the reliability of VaR.▪ Fifth, we develop an analysis of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo Models, Gibbs Sampling and Metropolis-Hastings statistical computing algorithms for enabling Bayesian statistical inference methodologies to minimize model risk in Cyber risk and Cyber insurance risk modeling for the specific context of cybersecurity.▪ Sixth, we develop the first known portfolio theory based framework for Cyber insurance modeling with guidance to minimize model risks, tail risks, and systemic risks inherent in models in commercial Cyber insurance modeling.▪ Finally, given increasing role of uncertainty in cyber (and financial) risk modeling and management, we develop a framework for enabling Knightian uncertainty management relating it to model risk management.Understanding of the developed frameworks and technical models listed above should minimize model risk in the recommended applications based on above contributions.Updated, revised, summary version of the thesis invited for submission by NAIC as:National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Expert Paper: The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is the U.S. standard-setting and regulatory support organization created and governed by the chief insurance regulators from the 50 states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories.

背景：本著作是首篇将金融量化方法、量化金融与金融科技建模研发推进至"人工智能-机器学习-量化-网络-加密-量子-风险-计算"时代的论文。当前这份关于全球金融危机后金融、量化与风险建模的博士后研究论文，基于对危机后量化金融、计算机科学、网络与计算机安全工程研发成果的整合。它提出了开创性的加密时代网络-金融-信任工程框架，其前身是首篇数字化转型社交网络量化建模博士论文——该论文率先探索了万维网时代的数字量化-IT-金融-控制-风险模型、去中心化控制模型以及数字社交知识资产研发。序言作为特许工程师出身，我曾领导美国及全球顶级银行的金融建模与开发项目，并为三大IT巨头（全球数百家银行金融机构的核心系统供应商）主导建模实施。随后我在全美前十博士项目中以双倍学分获得量化博士学位，并任雪城大学量化方法副教授，专注于量化风险建模研究。全球金融危机前夕，我的研究已开始质疑金融工程模型固有的模型风险——例如2005年接受英国管理研究出版商采访时即有所提及。这些问题涉及自然科学确定性/随机性模型与日益不确定的万维网时代社会技术网络的兼容性，以及传统金融工程风险模型应对快速动态数字世界的能力。由此开启的量化金融博士后研究，使我进入摩根大通私人银行等华尔街顶级投行工作，通过技术实践指导高管团队推进量化风险建模与分析，重点突破那些因金融危机期间大规模失效而备受诟病的传统模型。完成量化金融项目后，我继续深耕计算金融与网络安全博士后研究。随着白宫、财政部、国土安全部及货币监理署接连发布网络安全紧急预警，本论文应运而生。其诞生源于对金融危机元凶风险模型的观察——这些曾险些摧毁美国投行的模型，如今正被商业机构广泛运用于网络风险与保险建模……摘要网络保险的量化建模尚处萌芽阶段，实证研究与可靠数据匮乏。当前研究表明风险价值模型（VaR）是主流选择，但其尾部风险与系统性风险的建模缺陷正是金融危机的关键诱因（Haldane & Nelson, 2012; Malhotra, 2012, 2014）。为此美联储要求金融机构遵循模型风险管理指引（2011），巴塞尔委员会亦弃用VaR（2013）。本文通过定性框架对比网络风险与传统金融风险的尾部/系统性风险水平，证实VaR完全不适用于网络保险建模。我们开发了专属模型风险管理框架，区分模型选择与方法论选择导致的风险，演示如何通过多模型交叉验证管理VaR风险，并提供连贯风险度量替代方案。为持续优化，我们：1）分析贝叶斯统计推断作为频率学派替代方案的可行性；2）研究马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛模型及相关算法以实现贝叶斯方法；3）构建奈特不确定性管理框架应对网络风险的特殊性。贡献为避免当前商业模型固有风险引发全国性网络保险灾难，本论文作出以下贡献：▪ 首创网络-金融-信任框架，解析金融风险与网络风险交织放大的系统性特征▪ 开发首个网络保险模型风险管理框架▪ 首次揭示主流模型存在的极端尾部风险与系统性风险▪ 对VaR与贝叶斯方法进行实证研究，提出多模型交叉验证方案▪ 针对网络安全场景，开发马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛模型应用框架▪ 基于投资组合理论构建网络保险建模框架▪ 首创关联奈特不确定性与模型风险的管理框架上述框架的应用可有效降低模型风险。本论文修订版已应美国保险监理官协会（NAIC）邀约提交为专家论文：Malhotra, Yogesh，《超越VaR：网络保险核保模型风险管理前瞻》（2017年6月24日），SSRN编号3081492。应NAIC特邀于2017年6月24日提交的专家论文。
