We start by presenting a reduced-form multiple default type of model and derive abstract results on the influence of a state variable X on credit spreads, when both the intensity and the loss quota distribution are driven by X. The aim is to apply the results to a concrete real life situation, namely, to the influence of macroeconomic risks on credit spreads term structures. There has been increasing support in the empirical literature that both the probability of default (PD) and the loss given default (LGD) are correlated and driven by macroeconomic variables. Paradoxically, there has been very little effort from the theoretical literature to develop credit risk models that would include this possibility. A possible justification has to do with the increase in complexity this leads to, even for the "treatable" default intensity models. The goal of this paper is to develop the theoretical framework needed to handle this situation and, through numerical simulation, understand the impact on credit risk term structures of the macroeconomic risks. In the proposed model the state of the economy is modeled trough the dynamics of a market index, that enters directly on the functional form of both the intensity of default and the distribution of the loss quota q given default. Given this setup, we are able to make periods of economic depression, periods of higher default intensity as well as periods where low recovery is more likely, producing a business cycle effect. Furthermore, we allow for the possibility of an index volatility that depends negatively on the index level and show that, when we include this realistic feature, the impacts on the credit spread term structure are emphasized.

我们首先提出一个简化形式的多重违约类型模型，并推导出当违约强度和损失配额分布均受状态变量X驱动时，X对信用利差影响的抽象结果。目的是将这些结果应用于具体的现实情境，即宏观经济风险对信用利差期限结构的影响。实证文献日益支持违约概率（PD）和违约损失率（LGD）存在相关性且均受宏观经济变量驱动的观点。然而矛盾的是，理论文献却极少致力于开发包含这种可能性的信用风险模型。一个可能的解释在于，即便对于"可处理"的违约强度模型，这也会导致复杂性增加。本文目标是构建处理这种情况所需的理论框架，并通过数值模拟来理解宏观经济风险对信用风险期限结构的影响。在所提出的模型中，经济状态通过市场指数的动态变化来建模，该指数直接进入违约强度函数和违约条件下损失配额q的分布函数。基于此设置，我们能够模拟经济萧条时期——这些时期不仅违约强度更高，且低回收率的可能性更大，从而产生商业周期效应。此外，我们允许指数波动率与指数水平呈负相关，并证明当加入这一现实特征时，对信用利差期限结构的影响会被放大。
