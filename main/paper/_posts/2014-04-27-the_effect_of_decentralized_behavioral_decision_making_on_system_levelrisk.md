Certain classes of system-level risk depend partly on decentralized lay decision making. For instance, an organization's network security risk depends partly on its employees' responses to phishing attacks. On a larger scale, the risk within a financial system depends partly on households' responses to mortgage sales pitches. Behavioral economics shows that lay decision makers typically depart in systematic ways from the normative rationality of Expected Utility (EU), and instead display heuristics and biases as captured in the more descriptively accurate Prospect Theory (PT). In turn psychological studies show that successful deception ploys eschew direct logical argumentation and instead employ peripheral-route persuasion, manipulation of visceral emotions, urgency, and familiar contextual cues. The detection of phishing emails and inappropriate mortgage contracts may be framed as a binary classification task. Signal Detection Theory (SDT) offers the standard normative solution, formulated as an optimal cutoff threshold, for distinguishing between good/bad emails or mortgages. In this paper we extend SDT behaviorally by re-deriving the optimal cutoff threshold under PT. Furthermore we incorporate the psychology of deception into determination of SDT's discriminability parameter. With the neo-additive probability weighting function, the optimal cutoff threshold under PT is rendered unique under well-behaved sampling distributions, tractable in computation, and transparent in interpretation. The PT-based cutoff threshold is (i) independent of loss aversion and (ii) more conservative than the classical SDT cutoff threshold. Independently of any possible misalignment between individual-level and system-level misclassification costs, decentralized behavioral decision makers are biased toward under-detection, and system-level risk is consequently greater than in analyses predicated upon normative rationality.

某些系统级风险类别部分依赖于分散的非专业决策。例如，一个组织的网络安全风险部分取决于员工对钓鱼攻击的反应。更大范围内，金融体系的风险部分取决于家庭对抵押贷款推销的应对方式。行为经济学表明，非专业决策者通常会以系统性方式偏离期望效用理论（EU）的规范性理性，转而表现出启发式与偏见，这些特征在描述性更准确的前景理论（PT）中得以体现。心理学研究则显示，成功的欺骗手段会避开直接逻辑论证，转而采用外围路径说服、操纵本能情绪、制造紧迫感及利用熟悉情境线索。检测钓鱼邮件和不适当抵押合同可视为二元分类任务。信号检测理论（SDT）提供了标准规范性解决方案——通过最优截止阈值区分良性/恶意邮件或贷款。本文从行为角度拓展SDT，在PT框架下重新推导最优截止阈值，并将欺骗心理学融入SDT辨别力参数的确定过程。采用新可加概率加权函数时，PT下的最优截止阈值在良好抽样分布中具有唯一性、计算易处理性及解释透明性。基于PT的截止阈值具有两大特征：（1）与损失厌恶无关；（2）比经典SDT阈值更保守。即使不考虑个体层面与系统层面误判成本的潜在错配，分散的行为决策者也存在检测不足的倾向，因此系统风险会大于基于规范性理性的分析结果。
