Trade policy and instruments are not gender neutral and can work either to promote or to undermine gender equality. The gender theme integrates international trade regulation, being part of UN, OECD, and WTO initiatives, as well as the subject of Preferential Trade Agreements. The research investigates whether, in addition to public elements, there are private instruments of international trade regulation that address gender equality. Can so-called voluntary private sustainability standards be used to promote gender equality through international trade? If so, could such instruments become technical barriers to international trade, impacting competition in Brazil? The research in the International Trade Centre database showed that 70% of the private voluntary sustainability standards mapped contain criteria related to gender equality. The agricultural sector, the flagship of Brazil's export agenda, proved to be the most affected. Such technical barriers to international trade can affect not only Brazil's export agenda but also its import agenda, as Brazilian consumers and companies can also become vectors of the demand and/or inclusion of gender labels in their products and/or production processes.

贸易政策及工具并非性别中立，既可促进亦会损害性别平等。性别议题已融入国际贸易规则体系，成为联合国、经合组织和世贸组织的倡议内容，也是优惠贸易协定的主题。本研究探讨了除公共性措施外，是否存在致力于性别平等的私营性国际贸易规制工具。所谓自愿性私营可持续标准能否通过国际贸易促进性别平等？若可行，这类工具是否会构成国际贸易技术壁垒，进而影响巴西的市场竞争？国际贸易中心数据库研究表明，70%已收录的私营自愿可持续标准包含性别平等相关条款。作为巴西出口主导产业的农业部门受此影响最为显著。此类国际贸易技术壁垒不仅可能冲击巴西出口体系，亦将波及进口领域——巴西消费者和企业可能成为推动产品及/或生产流程纳入性别标签的需求方与实施者。鉴于其对贸易流动的限制、经济主体间竞争的削弱，以及...[此处原文截断]对巴西反垄断领域产生的影响不容忽视。
