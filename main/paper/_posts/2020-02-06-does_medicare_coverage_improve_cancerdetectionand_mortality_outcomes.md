Medicare is a large government health insurance program in the United States that covers about 60 million people. This paper analyzes the effects of Medicare insurance on health for a group of people in urgent need of medical care: people with cancer. We used a regression discontinuity design to assess impacts of near‐universal Medicare insurance at age 65 on cancer detection and outcomes, using population‐based cancer registries and vital statistics data. Our analysis focused on the three tumor sites for which screening is recommended both before and after age 65: breast, colorectal, and lung cancer. At age 65, cancer detection increased by 72 per 100,000 population among women and 33 per 100,000 population among men; cancer mortality also decreased by nine per 100,000 population for women but did not significantly change for men. In a placebo check, we found no comparable changes at age 65 in Canada. This study provides the first evidence to our knowledge that near‐universal access to Medicare at age 65 is associated with improvements in population‐level cancer mortality.

医疗保险是美国一项大型政府健康保险计划，覆盖约6000万人。本文分析了医疗保险对急需医疗服务的癌症患者群体的健康影响。我们采用断点回归设计，基于人群的癌症登记和生命统计数据，评估了65岁近乎全民医保对癌症检出率和治疗效果的影响。研究重点关注65岁前后均建议筛查的三种肿瘤：乳腺癌、结直肠癌和肺癌。数据显示，65岁女性癌症检出率每10万人增加72例，男性增加33例；女性癌症死亡率每10万人下降9例，男性则无显著变化。对照实验中，加拿大65岁人群未出现类似变化。本研究首次证明，65岁近乎全民医保的普及与人群层面癌症死亡率的改善存在关联。
