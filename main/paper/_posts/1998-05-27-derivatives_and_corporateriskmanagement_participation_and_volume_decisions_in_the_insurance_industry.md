The use of derivatives in corporate risk management has grown rapidly in recent years. In this paper, the authors explore the factors that influence the use of financial derivatives in the U.S. insurance industry. Their objective is to investigate the motivations for corporate risk management The authors use regulatory data on individual holdings and transactions in derivative markets. According to modern finance theory, shares of widely held corporations are held by diversified investors who operate in frictionless and complete markets and eliminate non-systematic risk through their portfolio choices. But this theory has been challenged by new hypotheses that take into account market imperfections, information asymmetries and incentive conflicts as motivations for corporate managers to change the risk/return profile of their firm. The authors develop a set of hypotheses regarding the hedging behavior of insurers and perform tests on a sample of life and property-liability insurers to test them. The sample consists of all U.S. life and property-liability insurers reporting to the NAIC. The authors investigate the decision to conduct derivatives transactions and the volume of transactions undertaken. There are two primary theories about the motivations for corporate risk management - maximization of shareholder value and maximization of managerial utility. The authors discuss these theories, the hypotheses they develop from them , and specify variables to test their hypotheses. They posit the following rationales for why corporations may choose to engage in risk management and also specify variables that help them study the use of these rationales by insurance firms: to avoid the costs of financial distress; to hedge part of their investment default/volatility/liquidity risks; to avoid shocks to equity that result in high leverage ratios; to minimize taxes and enhance firm value by reducing the volatility of earnings; to maximize managerial utility. The authors argue that the use of derivatives for speculative purposes in the insurance industry is not common. The authors analyze the decision by insurers to enter the market and their volume of transactions. They use probit analysis to study the participation decision and Tobit analysis along with Cragg's generalization of the Tobit analysis to study volume. The results provide support for the authors' hypothesis that insurers hedge to maximize shareholder value. The analysis provides only weak support for the managerial utility hypothesis. Insurers are motivated to use financial derivatives to reduce the expected costs of financial distress. There is also evidence that insurers use derivatives to hedge asset volatility and exchange rate risks. There is also evidence that there are significant economies of scale in running derivatives operations - only large firms and/or those with higher than average risk exposure find it worthwhile to pay the fixed cost of setting up a derivatives operation. Overall, insurers with higher than average asset risk exposures use derivative securities.

近年来，衍生品在企业风险管理中的运用迅速增长。本文作者探讨了影响美国保险业使用金融衍生品的因素，旨在研究企业风险管理的动机。作者利用监管机构提供的衍生品市场个体持仓与交易数据展开分析。现代金融理论认为，股权分散型企业的股票由多元化投资者持有，这些投资者在无摩擦的完全市场中通过投资组合选择消除非系统性风险。但该理论正受到新假说的挑战——这些假说将市场缺陷、信息不对称和激励冲突视为企业管理者调整公司风险/收益特征的动因。作者针对保险公司的对冲行为提出一系列假设，并通过对寿险与财产责任险公司的样本测试进行验证。研究样本涵盖所有向美国保险监督官协会（NAIC）提交报告的美国寿险及财产责任险公司。作者重点考察了企业开展衍生品交易的决策过程及交易规模。关于企业风险管理动机存在两大主流理论：股东价值最大化理论和管理者效用最大化理论。作者讨论了这些理论及其衍生的假设，并设定变量进行检验。他们提出以下企业可能选择风险管理的理由，同时设定相应变量以研究保险公司对这些理由的运用：规避财务困境成本；对冲部分投资违约/波动性/流动性风险；避免导致高杠杆率的权益冲击；通过降低盈利波动实现节税并提升企业价值；实现管理者效用最大化。作者指出保险业鲜少将衍生品用于投机目的。通过分析保险公司进入衍生品市场的决策与交易规模，作者采用概率单位模型（Probit）研究参与决策，并运用托宾模型（Tobit）及Cragg对托宾模型的推广来研究交易规模。结果支持作者关于"保险公司为股东价值最大化进行对冲"的假设，但对管理者效用假说的支持较弱。研究表明：保险公司运用金融衍生品的主要动机是降低预期财务困境成本；同时存在证据表明其通过衍生品对冲资产波动性与汇率风险；衍生品业务运营具有显著规模效应——仅大型公司和/或风险敞口高于平均水平的企业认为值得支付建立衍生品业务的固定成本。总体而言，资产风险敞口高于平均水平的保险公司更倾向于使用衍生证券。
