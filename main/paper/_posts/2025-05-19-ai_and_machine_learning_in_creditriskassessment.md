This paper explores the transformative role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in credit risk assessment within the banking sector. Traditional credit scoring models, often based on linear regression and static rules, are increasingly being supplanted by sophisticated AI algorithms capable of analyzing vast and complex datasets to predict default risk with greater accuracy. The study examines current applications of AI in assessing borrower creditworthiness, including natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques, highlighting how these tools enhance predictive performance and operational efficiency. However, the adoption of black-box models introduces significant ethical and regulatory challenges, particularly in terms of transparency, fairness, and accountability. This paper also addresses model risk management practices, emphasizing the need for explainable AI and robust governance frameworks to mitigate bias and ensure compliance. Through a balanced analysis of technological innovation and its implications, this research contributes to the discourse on responsible AI adoption in financial services.

本文探讨了人工智能（AI）与机器学习（ML）在银行业信用风险评估中的变革性作用。传统信用评分模型通常基于线性回归和静态规则，而如今正逐渐被能够分析海量复杂数据、更精准预测违约风险的先进AI算法所取代。研究分析了AI在评估借款人信用度方面的当前应用，包括自然语言处理（NLP）和深度学习技术，重点阐释了这些工具如何提升预测性能与运营效率。然而，"黑箱"模型的采用也带来了显著的伦理与监管挑战，尤其在透明度、公平性和问责制方面。本文还探讨了模型风险管理实践，强调需要可解释AI和强健的治理框架以降低偏见并确保合规。通过对技术创新及其影响的平衡分析，本研究为金融服务领域负责任地采用AI的讨论提供了见解。
