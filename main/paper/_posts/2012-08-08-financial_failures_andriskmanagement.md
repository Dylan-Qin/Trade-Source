Financial failures observed during global financial crisis have again underlined the importance of effective risk management. In this article, the author analyzes the best instrument, namely self discipline, official discipline and market discipline, for the effective risk management. In the light of literature review and lessons of firm/system wide financial failures, we also analyze degree of efficiency of disciplinary methods. We first conclude, however it may not provide optimal solutions to the risk management problems of financial intermediaries, better risk management standards should be developed. We also conclude that firm wide risk management processes may be managed by pragmatic regulatory policies without get into negative impacts of market mechanism and big financial firms’ pressures.

全球金融危机中观察到的金融失败再次凸显了有效风险管理的重要性。本文作者分析了实现有效风险管理的最佳工具，即自律、官方监管与市场约束。基于文献综述及企业/系统层面金融失败的教训，我们还评估了各类约束方法的效率程度。首先我们得出结论：尽管可能无法为金融中介机构的风险管理问题提供最优解，但仍需制定更完善的风险管理标准。其次我们认为，通过务实的监管政策可实现企业全面风险管理流程的优化，同时避免市场机制与大型金融机构压力带来的负面影响。
