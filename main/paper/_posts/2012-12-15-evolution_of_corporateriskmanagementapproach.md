Risk management is a field that more and more often can be found not only in academic dissertations but above all in corporate requirements. Due to complexity of factors shaping the economic situation the risk in decision-taking processes in an organization is increasing. These factors induced the author of this paper to trace the changes that took place in the perception of risk by organizations, and consequently the ways of coping with risk. The aim of this paper is to present changes that have occurred in the field of risk management from the crystallization of the conception of risk management up to the latest activities in this area reflected in the standard ISO 31000.

风险管理这一领域不仅越来越多地出现在学术论文中，更重要的是已成为企业运营的必备要求。由于影响经济形势的因素日益复杂，组织决策过程中的风险正不断加剧。这些因素促使本文作者追溯组织对风险认知的演变历程，进而探究应对风险方式的变迁。本文旨在呈现风险管理领域从概念形成到ISO 31000标准所体现的最新实践所发生的变化。
