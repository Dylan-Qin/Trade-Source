Due to the lack of descriptive information about the effectiveness of risk management activities, decision-makers often have to rely on (their own) prior experience with these investments. Thus, we propose a novel, feedback-based approach to examine risk management decisions. We simulate individuals’ decisions over 50 time periods and analyze how distributional properties of different risk management instruments influence subjects’ propensity to invest in self-insurance or self-protection. Our results show that subjects act more risk averse over time because self-insurance take-up rates increase when learners gain more experience. Individuals’ risk management decisions are price-sensitive but we find only limited evidence for a complementary relationship between both risk management options. Our findings provide an alternative explanation for the low demand for risk management investments against low probability risks and can be used to predict developments in new insurance markets with inexperienced policyholders.

由于缺乏关于风险管理活动有效性的描述性信息，决策者往往不得不依赖（自身）对这些投资的既往经验。为此，我们提出了一种基于反馈的新方法来检验风险管理决策。我们模拟了50个时间段内个体的决策，分析不同风险管理工具的分佈特性如何影响受试者对自我保险或自我保护的投入倾向。结果显示，随着学习者经验积累，自我保险的采纳率上升，受试者会随时间推移表现出更强的风险规避倾向。个体的风险管理决策对价格敏感，但我们仅发现有限证据表明两种风险管理选项存在互补关系。这些发现为低概率风险领域风险管理投资需求低迷现象提供了另一种解释，并可用于预测由缺乏经验的投保人构成的新保险市场发展趋势。
