National debates over policies that affect the flow of digital information are heating up as censorship, surveillance, control over personal data, and requirements to store data locally have emerged as contentious political issues. In the coming years, governments will need to carefully craft policies that preserve the free flow of information and avoid data nationalism.But these policies are not just domestic in nature. The regulations that emerge will have an international dimension due to their impact on companies and individuals in other countries. In an ideal word, domestic regulation would not lead to trade conflict, but in reality it often does. To address the conflicts that might arise from regulatory effects abroad, there have been efforts at the bilateral, regional, and multilateral level to develop international rules on digital governance. The scope of digital trade agreements is still evolving, but, to take one example, the recent U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement defines “digital product” as “a computer program, text, video, image, sound recording, or other product that is digitally encoded, produced for commercial sale or distribution, and that can be transmitted electronically.”1 With this and other provisions that establish broad coverage, these agreements will have an impact on virtually all commercial activity on the internet and on smartphone apps.The international rules for digital trade address specific regulatory issues such as consumer protection and spam, but they also include the broad principle of nondiscrimination, which offers more general international oversight. Two key aspects of that principle are the nondiscrimination obligation, which in the international trade context requires that domestic regulations treat comparable foreign and domestic products alike and treat comparable foreign products from different countries alike; and exceptions for various public policies, which ensure that the international trade regime does not interfere with policymaking on nontrade issues. Under the Trump administration, the United States put forward specific language during negotiations on these digital agreements that results in an overly broad approach to the nondiscrimination obligation and a narrow approach to the exceptions. This paper argues that the Biden administration should reconsider current U.S. policy in this area and adjust the proposals it has made in the ongoing World Trade Organization (WTO) e‐​commerce negotiations.

围绕影响数字信息流动政策的全国性辩论正日趋激烈，审查制度、监控、个人数据控制及数据本地化存储要求已成为具有争议的政治议题。未来几年，各国政府需审慎制定政策，既要维护信息自由流动，又要避免数据民族主义。但这些政策不仅具有国内属性，因其对别国企业和个人的影响，相关法规还将产生国际维度。理想情况下，国内监管不应引发贸易冲突，但现实中却屡见不鲜。. . 为应对监管措施可能引发的跨国冲突，双边、区域和多边层面已展开协调，致力于制定数字治理国际规则。数字贸易协议的范畴仍在扩展，以《美日数字贸易协定》为例，其将"数字产品"定义为"以商业销售或分发为目的、可通过电子方式传输的计算机程序、文本、视频、图像、录音及其他数字化编码产品"。此类条款的广泛覆盖性，将对互联网及智能手机应用上的几乎所有商业活动产生影响。. . 数字贸易国际规则既涉及消费者保护与垃圾邮件等具体监管问题，也包含非歧视性原则这一提供普遍性国际监督的宽泛准则。该原则包含两大关键要素：一是非歧视义务，要求国内法规对同类国内外产品一视同仁，并对不同国家的同类外国产品平等对待；二是公共政策例外条款，确保国际贸易体系不干预非贸易议题的决策。特朗普政府曾在数字协议谈判中提出特定措辞，导致非歧视义务范围过宽而例外条款过窄。本文主张拜登政府应重新审视美国现行政策，并调整其在世贸组织电子商务谈判中的现有提案。
