The growing energy security and climate change concerns have created a huge demand and global market for renewable energy technologies such as solar panels. The race to capture a share of this lucrative global market and other political economy considerations have inspired a trade war. Much of this war has been fought with and against green industrial policy measures such as subsidies tied to local content requirements and trade remedy instruments such as antidumping and countervailing duties. Safeguard measures are the latest additions to the armoury of trade defence measures in this burgeoning trade war. This article examines the dynamics behind and the implications of the turn to renewable energy safeguards for the global effort to accelerate the development and deployment of renewable energy technologies in light of the recent WTO Panel report on US – Safeguard Measure on PV Products. The article makes three interrelated arguments. First, the WTO jurisprudence on renewable energy support measures and rapidly evolving global value chains in renewable energy technologies helped spur the turn to safeguard measures. Second, the seal of approval from the Panel will drive interest in the use of renewable energy safeguards. Third, the increased and unfettered use of safeguard measures is detrimental to the transition towards sustainable energy sources.

日益增长的能源安全和气候变化问题为太阳能电池板等可再生能源技术创造了巨大需求和全球市场。争夺这一利润丰厚的全球市场份额的竞争以及其他政治经济因素引发了一场贸易战。这场战争大多围绕与本地含量要求挂钩的补贴等绿色产业政策措施，以及反倾销和反补贴税等贸易救济工具展开。保障措施成为这场新兴贸易战中贸易防御武器库的最新成员。本文结合世贸组织专家组关于美国——光伏产品保障措施案的报告，探讨了转向可再生能源保障措施背后的动态及其对全球加速开发和部署可再生能源技术努力的影响。文章提出了三个相互关联的观点：首先，世贸组织关于可再生能源支持措施的判例以及快速演变的可再生能源技术全球价值链助推了保障措施的转向；其次，专家组裁决的认可将推动各国对使用可再生能源保障措施的兴趣；第三，保障措施的滥用将阻碍向可持续能源的转型。
