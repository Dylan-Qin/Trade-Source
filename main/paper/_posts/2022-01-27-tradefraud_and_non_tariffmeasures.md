Similar to tariffs, non-tariff measures (NTMs) may induce trade fraud when they are restrictive. This paper examines whether discrepancies observed in the official trade statistics of importing and exporting countries are partly due to trade fraud associated with evading border NTMs. To capture the restrictiveness of NTMs, this paper estimates the ad valorem equivalent (AVE) with importer-exporter-product variations. This paper presents a theoretical model and empirical evidence showing that discrepancies increase with AVEs, consistent with the trade fraud due to traders intentionally mis-declaring countries of origin and product classifications in order to evade border NTMs. The results are driven by homogeneous products and the trade between developed and developing countries.

与关税类似，非关税措施（NTMs）若具有限制性，也可能诱发贸易欺诈。本文研究进口国与出口国官方贸易统计数据间的差异是否部分源于逃避边境非关税措施的贸易欺诈行为。为量化非关税措施的限制程度，本文采用进口方-出口方-产品三维变量估算了从价等值税率（AVE）。通过理论模型与实证分析，本文证明统计差异会随AVE值上升而扩大，这与贸易商为规避边境非关税措施而故意虚报原产国和商品分类的欺诈行为特征相符。该现象主要由同质化产品及发达国家与发展中国家之间的贸易所驱动。
