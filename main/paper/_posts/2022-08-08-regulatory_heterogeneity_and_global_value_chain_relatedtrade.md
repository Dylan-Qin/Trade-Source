In this paper, I estimate the impact of heterogeneity in non-tariff measures policies on countries’ global value chain-related trade and its backward and forward components. I first build a regulatory distance index, which measures the degree of dissimilarity in non-tariff measure structures between two trade partners. By including the regulatory distance index in a structural gravity model, I then find a significant negative effect of regulatory distance on total, backward, and forward global value chain-related trade. The negative impact is even more substantial when I restrict the analysis to manufacturing sectors. On the country dimension, I demonstrate that the effects of regulatory distance are associated with the exporters’ and the importers’ income levels.

本文中，我评估了非关税措施政策异质性对各国全球价值链相关贸易及其后向与前向组成部分的影响。首先构建了一个监管距离指数，用于衡量两个贸易伙伴间非关税措施结构的差异程度。通过将该指数纳入结构引力模型，我发现监管距离对全球价值链相关总贸易、后向贸易和前向贸易均存在显著负面影响。当分析范围限定在制造业部门时，这种负面效应更为显著。在国家维度上，我证明了监管距离的影响与出口国和进口国的收入水平存在关联。
