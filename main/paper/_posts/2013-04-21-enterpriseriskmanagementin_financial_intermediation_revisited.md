This paper amplifies themes growing out of Greenbaum, 2012. That paper presented a framework for thinking about Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). We begin this paper by deconstructing the concepts of risk, risk management and ERM. These are all unsettled ideas, but they have been adapted and deployed in the effort to advance management techniques in public companies and other types of organizations concerned with their mortality. We next explore the distinction between core risks, those that businesses process profitably and ancillary risks, all others that constitute a nuisance in that the firm possesses no special skills in dealing with them. In the final section, we share some normative thoughts about ERM as a process. The perspective is unabashedly that of the board member. At the end of the day, ERM is little more than formality designed to reduce the threat of terminal hazards, hazards that tend to be ignored in the normal course of events.

本文深化了Greenbaum 2012年提出的议题。该论文曾提出一个思考企业风险管理（ERM）的框架。我们首先解构风险、风险管理和ERM的概念。这些都是尚未定论的理念，但已被采纳并应用于提升上市公司及其他关注存续问题的组织的管理技术。接着我们探讨核心风险（企业能从中盈利的业务风险）与附属风险（企业无特殊应对能力、构成经营困扰的其他风险）之间的区别。最后部分，我们分享关于ERM流程的规范性思考，毫不掩饰地从董事会成员的视角出发。归根结底，ERM不过是一种旨在减少致命威胁的形式化程序——那些在日常运营中容易被忽视的终极风险。
