With international trade moving from "trade in (final) goods" to "trade in tasks", effective protection rates (EPRs) are back to the stage. Input-output matrices are used in this paper to monitor the production structure of 10 Asian-Pacific countries between 1995 and 2005, and to calculate sectorial EPRs. The paper proposes a series of counter-factual simulation methods aimed at isolating the specific contribution of changes in tariff policies, in production structure or in real exchange rates. International input-output matrices allowed also to compute and compare the average propagation length of a cost-push linked to a sudden change in tariff duties, identifying those sectors that are the most deeply interconnected, both in the intensity and in the length of their inter-industrial foreign relationships.

随着国际贸易从“（最终）商品贸易”转向“任务贸易”，有效保护率（EPRs）重新回到舞台中央。本文运用投入产出矩阵追踪了1995至2005年间10个亚太国家的生产结构，并计算了各行业的有效保护率。研究提出了一系列反事实模拟方法，旨在分离关税政策变化、生产结构调整或实际汇率波动的具体影响。国际投入产出矩阵还能测算并比较关税突然变动引发的成本推动效应的平均传导时长，从而识别出那些在产业间国际关联强度与持续时间维度上深度融合的行业。
