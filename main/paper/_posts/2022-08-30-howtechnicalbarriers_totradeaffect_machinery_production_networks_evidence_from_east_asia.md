We estimate the effects of technical barriers to trade (TBT) on machinery imports in international production networks. Using disaggregated detailed product data and the gravity model, we estimate the TBT notifications in two separate measures of TBT, namely cumulative TBT, and TBT dummy, evidencing significantly negative effects on machinery imports. This evidence suggests that TBT are trade barriers that restricts the development of machinery production networks. However, this negative effect appears to come from the final product. By contrast, TBT related to parts and components have larger positive effects than those related to final products for imports.

我们评估了技术性贸易壁垒(TBT)对国际生产网络中机械产品进口的影响。通过使用细分的详细产品数据和引力模型，我们采用累计TBT和TBT虚拟变量两种测量方式对TBT通报进行估算，结果均显示其对机械进口具有显著负面影响。这一证据表明TBT是阻碍机械生产网络发展的贸易壁垒。然而，这种负面影响似乎主要来自最终产品。相比之下，与零部件相关的TBT对进口产生的积极效应要大于与最终产品相关的TBT。
