In this paper, we propose a general modeling framework for operational risk management of financial firms. We consider operational risk events as shocks to a financial firm's value process, and then study capital investments in preventive and corrective controls to mitigate risk losses. The optimal decisions would be made under three scenarios: (i) preventive control only, (ii) corrective control only, and (iii) joint controls. We characterize the optimal control policies under a general modeling framework under these three scenarios, and then discuss an exponential risk reduction function. We conclude our work with an implementation of our model to a data set from a commercial bank. We find that through a proper investment strategy, we can achieve a significant performance improvement, especially when the risk severity level is high. At the bank we analyze, we find that within a certain range of the frequency reduction efficiency we can achieve up to 2.5% improvement in the expected bank revenue; within a proper range of risk severity reduction efficiency, we can achieve an improvement of up to 1.5%. In general, our modeling framework, which combines a typical operational risk process with stochastic control, may suggest a new research direction in operations management and operational risk management.

本文提出了一种适用于金融机构操作风险管理的通用建模框架。我们将操作风险事件视为对金融机构价值过程的冲击，进而研究预防性控制和纠正性控制的资本投入以降低风险损失。最优决策将在三种情境下制定：（i）仅采取预防性控制，（ii）仅采取纠正性控制，以及（iii）联合采取两种控制。我们在这三种情境下构建了通用框架下的最优控制策略特征，随后探讨了指数型风险削减函数。最后通过商业银行数据集的模型实证完成研究。研究发现，通过合理的投资策略能实现显著的绩效提升，尤其在风险严重程度较高时更为明显。在分析的银行案例中，当风险频率削减效率处于特定区间时，预期银行收益最高可提升2.5%；在适当的风险严重程度削减效率范围内，最高可获得1.5%的改善。总体而言，本框架将典型操作风险过程与随机控制相结合，可能为运营管理和操作风险管理领域开辟新的研究方向。
