The Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement has brought concern to its distortion of trade. The value of trade distortion since the implementation of SPS measures, are of increasing interest, these are evaluated by taking a qualified trade volume in proviso of estimating the terms of trade between nations before adopting the SPS measure and after. The paper is of theoretical assumption, assessing high-valued agricultural products between European members and their trading partners. It aims to provide theoretical evidence of the changes adopted in the terms of trade structure from implementing SPS Measures. The paper explores how European Agricultural Trade volumes have changed. Producing at SPS measure requirements, lead to an increase in costs, while it may be a small proportion of the value-added to the final value, it still will have an affect upon the bilateral Terms of Trade Agreement. An assessment is made upon the risk of compliance using a Cost-Benefit analysis to evaluate the costs of implementing SPS measures. Also incorporating an inventory approach, the extent of SPS measure distortion is assessed. The consequence of the distortion may be seen with the loss of comparative advantages and the movement towards other products.

《卫生与植物检疫（SPS）协定》引发了人们对其扭曲贸易的担忧。自实施SPS措施以来，贸易扭曲的价值日益受到关注，这些价值通过采用合格贸易量来评估，即在采用SPS措施之前和之后估计国家间贸易条件的变化。本文基于理论假设，评估了欧洲成员国与其贸易伙伴之间高价值农产品的情况。其目的是为实施SPS措施后贸易条件结构变化提供理论证据。本文探讨了欧洲农产品贸易量的变化。按照SPS措施要求生产会导致成本增加，虽然这可能只是最终价值增值的一小部分，但仍会对双边贸易条件协定产生影响。通过成本效益分析评估了实施SPS措施的成本，从而对合规风险进行了评估。同时结合清单方法，评估了SPS措施扭曲的程度。这种扭曲的后果可能表现为比较优势的丧失以及向其他产品的转移。
