While trade in goods has  been investigated extensively over decades, studies on trade in services are relatively new. In this paper we investigate the impacts of information and communication technology (ICT) on  trade in services . We measured ICT by four dimensions, including the subscriptions to broadband, fixed telephones, mobile phones and Internet. Our sample covered more than 200 countries, from 2005 to 2015. We employed the modified gravity model and found that all four dimensions had significant impacts on the expansion  trade in services, but mobile subscriptions is the most consistent dimension. Finally the effects of ICT in  exporting and importing  countries are similar.

数十年来，商品贸易已被广泛研究，而服务贸易的相关研究相对较新。本文探讨了信息通信技术（ICT）对服务贸易的影响。我们通过四个维度衡量ICT发展水平，包括宽带、固定电话、移动电话和互联网的订阅量。研究样本涵盖2005至2015年间200多个国家。采用修正后的引力模型分析发现，四个维度均对服务贸易扩张具有显著影响，其中移动电话订阅量的影响最为稳定。最后，ICT在出口国与进口国产生的影响程度相似。
