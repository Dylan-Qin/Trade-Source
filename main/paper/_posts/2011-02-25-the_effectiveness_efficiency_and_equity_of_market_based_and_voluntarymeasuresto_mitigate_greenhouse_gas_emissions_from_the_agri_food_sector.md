Agriculture accounts for 13 percent of global GHG emissions. This rises to approximately 30 percent if land clearance for farming, agrochemical production and trade in agricultural and food products are attributed to the sector. Market based mechanisms (carbon tax, cap and trade, payment for environmental services) and voluntary mitigation measures (carbon labeling and food miles) are reviewed for their effectiveness (if they reduce emissions), efficiency (the costs of the measures) and equity (fairness to suppliers). Measures to reduce agricultural emissions are limited in their effectiveness and efficiency by the technical difficulty and high costs of measuring, reporting and verification. However, pricing carbon would be effective in internalizing negative externalities in the transport, processing, retail and consumer purchase and preparation of food. The GTAP model is used to illustrate that a US $40 carbon tax implemented in the EU would have little negative impact on developing country exporters of agricultural products due to their low carbon intensity. Carbon labeling and food miles initiatives are likely to be ineffective, inefficient and unfair to developing country exporters.

农业占全球温室气体排放量的13%。如果将农田开垦、农用化学品生产以及农产品和食品贸易归入该行业，这一比例将上升至约30%。本文评估了基于市场的机制（碳税、限额与交易、环境服务付费）和自愿减排措施（碳标签和食物里程）在效果（是否能减少排放）、效率（措施的成本）和公平性（对供应商的公正程度）方面的表现。由于测量、报告和核查在技术上的难度和高成本，减少农业排放的措施在效果和效率上受到限制。然而，碳定价能有效将运输、加工、零售及消费者购买和准备食物过程中的负面外部性内部化。GTAP模型分析表明，欧盟实施40美元的碳税对发展中国家农产品出口商的负面影响较小，因其碳强度较低。碳标签和食物里程措施可能效果不佳、效率低下，且对发展中国家出口商不公平。
