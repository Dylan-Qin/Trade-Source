Corporate finance theory predicts that firms' characteristics affect agency costs and hence their efficiency. Cummins et al (2006) have proposed a cost function specification that measures separately insurer efficiency in handling risk pooling, risk management, and financial intermediation functions. We investigate the insurer characteristics that determine these efficiencies. Our empirical results show that mutuals outperform stock insurers in handling the three functions. Independent agents and high capitalization reduce the cost efficiency of risk pooling. Certain characteristics such as being a group of affiliated insurers, handling a higher volume of business in commercial lines, assuming more reinsurance, or investing a higher proportion of assets in bonds, do significantly increase insurers' efficiency in risk management and financial intermediation.

公司财务理论预测，企业的特征会影响代理成本，从而影响其效率。Cummins等人（2006年）提出了一种成本函数规范，分别衡量保险公司在风险汇聚、风险管理和金融中介职能方面的效率。我们研究了决定这些效率的保险公司特征。实证结果表明，互助保险公司在这三项职能上的表现优于股份制保险公司。独立代理人和高资本化会降低风险汇聚的成本效率。某些特征，如作为附属保险公司集团、在商业保险领域处理更高业务量、承担更多再保险、或将更高比例的资产投资于债券，确实显著提高了保险公司在风险管理和金融中介方面的效率。
