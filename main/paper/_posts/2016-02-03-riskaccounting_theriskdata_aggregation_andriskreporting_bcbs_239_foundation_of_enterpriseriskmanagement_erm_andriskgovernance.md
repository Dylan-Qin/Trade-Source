In the period following the global financial crisis high profile regulatory breaches and other instances of banks’ misconduct triggered widespread concern that the culture and standards of conduct in banks had declined to a point of unacceptability. The crisis also brought into sharp focus the inability of banks to completely and accurately report the risks they accept in order to create shareholder value. These events and circumstances culminated in a crisis of trust between banks and their stakeholders that include governments, regulators, investors and customers. In this same period regulators focused on their primary ‘capital-at-risk’ regimes administered through the Basel capital accords, reinforcing additional levels of capital as a bank’s primary protection against unexpected losses. At the same time Basel introduced ‘firm-at-risk’ mandates that required improvements in banks’ control over risk data and associated technology infrastructure. The most significant game changing post-crisis regulatory mandate in this regard is the Basel Committee’s principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting also known as ‘BCBS 239’. This new mandate requires banks: to implement controls over risk data that are as robust as those applicable to accounting data; to create accurate and single authoritative sources of risk data; and to ensure the precision, timeliness, comprehensiveness and adaptability of risk reporting. BCBS 239 effectively sets the parameters for enterprise risk management (ERM) and provides the foundation on which risk governance and risk cultures can positively evolve. Whereas BCBS 239 expressly states that a common risk metric for all forms of risk is not required, the authors challenge this thinking and argue that it is only through the adoption of a common risk metric that the objectives of BCBS 239 can be reasonably achieved. Part 1 of this paper explains why bankers – risk managers and accountants in particular – must view the need for the convergence of finance and risk systems within a common control and reporting framework as an imperative. Part 2 describes the ‘Risk Accounting’ methodology and its introduction of both a common measurement framework for all forms of risk and a common risk metric, the ‘Risk Unit’ or RU.

全球金融危机后的一段时期，高调的违规事件和银行的其他不当行为引发了广泛担忧，人们认为银行的文化和行为标准已降至不可接受的水平。这场危机还突显出银行无法完整准确地报告其为创造股东价值所承担的风险。这些事件和情况最终导致银行与包括政府、监管机构、投资者和客户在内的利益相关方之间出现信任危机。同一时期，监管机构重点关注通过《巴塞尔资本协议》实施的"风险资本"核心监管框架，通过强化多级资本要求，将其作为银行抵御意外损失的主要保障。与此同时，巴塞尔委员会推出了"机构风险"监管要求，规定银行必须加强对风险数据及相关技术基础设施的控制。这方面最具变革性的危机后监管要求，当属巴塞尔委员会《有效风险数据汇总与风险报告原则》（又称BCBS 239）。这项新规要求银行：实施与会计数据同等严格的风险数据管控；建立准确且唯一权威的风险数据来源；确保风险报告的精确性、及时性、全面性和适应性。BCBS 239实质上为企业风险管理（ERM）设定了参数，并为风险治理和风险文化的良性发展奠定了基础。虽然BCBS 239明确指出不需要对所有风险采用统一计量标准，但本文作者对此提出质疑，认为只有采用统一风险计量标准，才能合理实现BCBS 239的目标。本文第一部分阐述了为何银行从业者（尤其是风险管理人员和会计师）必须将财务与风险系统在统一管控和报告框架下的融合视为当务之急。第二部分介绍"风险会计"方法，该方法为所有风险形式建立了统一的计量框架，并引入通用风险计量单位——"风险单位"（RU）。
