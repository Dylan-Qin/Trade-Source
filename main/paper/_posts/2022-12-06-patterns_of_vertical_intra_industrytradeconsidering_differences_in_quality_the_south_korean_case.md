The simultaneous exports and imports within same industries is well known as the intra-industry trade (IIT). Since the pioneering empirical literatures of Balassa (1966)1) and Grubel and Lloyd (1975)2), bunch of empirical and theoretical papers studied this new paradigm of international trade challenging to the classical Heckscher - Ohlin paradigm. On the steps of IIT studies, the most essential progress was the division of IIT into Horizontal IIT (HIIT) and Vertical IIT (VIIT). This classification is based on the characteristics of product differentiation. HIIT is the trade of product which is close substitute but differ in characteristics, on the contrary VIIT differ in embodied quality level.In empirical literatures, the division between HIIT and VIIT is accomplished by unit price comparison. If unit price ratio defined as export product price over import product price of product which belong to same industry goes to specific range, this trade is on HIIT and if that ratio is out of that range this kind of trade go to VIIT. This simple methodology have been very common practical way for IIT research and generally the price ratio range for HIIT is 75~125% or 85~115%. In other words, if a product’s export price is higher than import price over 125% (or 115%) or lower than import price below 75% (or 85%), both cases are classified as VIIT. Another progress in IIT studies was the research on the determinants of HIIT/VIIT. Various countryand industry-specific determinants have been studied and differences in factor endowments and market size, physical and/or institutional barrier against trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) are the key elements determining IIT in country level.Though these determinants have been studied extensively during past decades, little is known of the impact of national technological capacity on IIT. Considering VIIT as occurring from product differentiation with quality difference, this is very surprising.In these perspectives, this paper investigates the determinants of Korea’s VIIT with special interest on national R&D stock. Classical analysis of VIIT will be followed by separated investigation of HQ-VIIT (Higher Quality VIIT) and LQ-VIIT (Lower Quality VIIT). This segregated analysis will give deepened understanding of VIIT determinants.

同一行业内同时存在的出口与进口现象被称为产业内贸易(IIT)。自Balassa(1966)和Grubel与Lloyd(1975)的开创性实证研究以来，大量实证与理论文献开始研究这一挑战传统赫克歇尔-俄林范式的新型国际贸易模式。在产业内贸易研究进程中，最重要的进展是将产业内贸易划分为水平型产业内贸易(HIIT)与垂直型产业内贸易(VIIT)。这种分类基于产品差异化的特征：水平型产业内贸易指特性不同但可相互替代的产品贸易，而垂直型产业内贸易则体现为产品质量等级的差异。. . 在实证研究中，通常采用单位价格比较法区分水平型与垂直型产业内贸易。若某行业产品出口单价与进口单价比值处于特定区间（通常为75%~125%或85%~115%），则归为水平型产业内贸易；若超出该区间则视为垂直型产业内贸易。这种简易方法已成为产业内贸易研究的通行做法。具体而言，当某产品出口价格高于进口价格125%（或115%）以上，或低于进口价格75%（或85%）以下时，均被归类为垂直型产业内贸易。. . 产业内贸易研究的另一进展是对其决定因素的探索。学者们研究了诸多国家与行业层面的影响因素，发现要素禀赋差异、市场规模、贸易与外商直接投资(FDI)的实体/制度壁垒是国家层面产业内贸易的关键决定因素。尽管这些因素在过去数十年得到广泛研究，但国家技术能力对产业内贸易的影响却鲜有涉及——考虑到垂直型产业内贸易源于产品质量差异形成的产品差异化，这一研究空白令人意外。. . 基于上述背景，本文重点考察韩国垂直型产业内贸易的决定因素，特别关注国家研发存量的影响。在经典垂直型产业内贸易分析基础上，本文还将分别研究高质量垂直型产业内贸易(HQ-VIIT)与低质量垂直型产业内贸易(LQ-VIIT)，这种分类研究将深化对垂直型产业内贸易决定机制的理解。
