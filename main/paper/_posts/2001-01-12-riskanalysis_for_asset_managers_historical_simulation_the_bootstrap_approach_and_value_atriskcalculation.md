From the risk management's perspective, one of the main differences between asset management companies and banks concerns the investment horizon: typically, asset managers have longer investment horizons. We compare different ways to deal with medium/long horizons, when the aim is to calculate absolute or relative VaR using a historical simulation approach and its variations, like bootstrapping procedures. We use several indices to test the accuracy of the different methods analysed. We find these methodologies: - can provide satisfactory assessments of tactical risk; - can inform portfolio managers of changes in market risk; - are also promising for strategic risk analysis.

从风险管理的角度来看，资产管理公司与银行之间的主要差异之一涉及投资期限：通常资产管理公司拥有更长的投资期限。我们比较了处理中长期期限的不同方法，旨在使用历史模拟法及其变体（如自助法程序）计算绝对或相对风险价值。我们采用多种指数来测试所分析不同方法的准确性。研究发现这些方法：- 能对战术风险提供令人满意的评估；- 可向投资组合经理提示市场风险的变化；- 对于战略风险分析也颇具前景。
