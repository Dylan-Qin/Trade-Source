In this paper we integrate the costs of trade finance in a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to evaluate the trade and output effects of counterfactual policy experiments on costs of and access to trade finance. The costs of financing international trade consist of two components: the financial costs and the costs associated with the risk of goods not being delivered, considering risk aversion of traders. These costs are determined for four ways to finance international trade (cash-in-advance, trade loans, letters of credit, and exports financed with internal working capital). Trade finance costs are a weighted average of the costs under the four different ways of financing. The framework is applied to trade of four ECOWAS countries employing data collected on financial costs, costs of risk and trade finance instrument shares through a comprehensive bank survey in these countries complemented with data from the literature. Counterfactual experiments on increases in the availability of letters of credit and trade loans and the costs of these instruments show that raising the shares and costs to African averages would increase trade of the four ECOWAS countries by about 11%. The framework is generic and can be applied to other countries.

本文通过将贸易融资成本纳入可计算一般均衡（CGE）模型，评估了关于贸易融资成本与可获得性的反事实政策实验对贸易和产出的影响。国际贸易融资成本包含两个组成部分：财务成本，以及考虑交易者风险厌恶情况下货物未交付风险相关的成本。这些成本针对四种国际贸易融资方式（预付款、贸易贷款、信用证、利用内部营运资金融资的出口）分别确定。贸易融资成本是四种不同融资方式下成本的加权平均值。该框架应用于四个西非国家经济共同体（ECOWAS）成员国的贸易分析，采用通过全面银行调查收集的财务成本、风险成本及贸易融资工具份额数据，并辅以文献数据。关于信用证和贸易贷款可获得性提升及其成本增加的反事实实验表明，将这些指标提升至非洲平均水平将使四个ECOWAS成员国的贸易量增长约11%。该框架具有普适性，可应用于其他国家。
