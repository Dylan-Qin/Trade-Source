Many novel technologies with a major economic interest, such as hydrogentechnologies also hold significant risks. Integrating the possible risk of eachfault into the fault detection (FD) process is critical to prevent alarmfloods andonly highlight truly safety-critical events. In this work the authors propose amethodology to integrate the knowledge of risks for faults into the FD processto minimize false alarmrate (FAR) and enable the operation of a unit at a stablesafety level. The method is showcased using the four tank benchmark problemanda case study of a reactor used in the hydrogen storage procedure. Dataabout the system behaviour is utilized to establish a dynamic kernel principalcomponent analysis (DKPCA)model for supervision of the process. Risks associatedwith the observed samples are estimated using the multinomial logisticregression model based on the scores of DKPCA (F1-score of 0.97). A two-stageturnout logic is utilized to determine if faults are present and if their risk categoriesvalidate raising alarms.During the validation stage in the hydrogen storage example problem, a decreaseof 42 % was observed in the number of raised alarms by excluding noncriticalevents fromthe perspective of process safety.

许多具有重大经济价值的新兴技术，如氢能技术，也伴随着显著风险。将每种故障的潜在风险整合到故障检测（FD）流程中，对于防止警报泛滥并仅突出真正安全关键事件至关重要。本研究提出一种方法，将故障风险知识融入故障检测流程，以最小化误报率（FAR），确保装置在稳定安全水平下运行。该方法通过四水箱基准问题和氢储存过程中使用的反应器案例研究进行验证。利用系统行为数据建立动态核主成分分析（DKPCA）模型进行过程监控，基于DKPCA得分（F1分数0.97）采用多项逻辑回归模型评估观测样本的风险。采用两级触发逻辑判定故障是否存在及其风险等级是否达到触发警报标准。在氢储存案例的验证阶段，通过排除非安全关键事件，触发警报数量减少了42%。
