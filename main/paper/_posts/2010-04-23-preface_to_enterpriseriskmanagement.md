This book expands the scope of risk management beyond insurance and finance to include accounting risk, terrorism, and other issues that can threaten an organization. It approaches risk management from five perspectives: in addition to the core perspective of financial risk management, it addresses perspectives of accounting, supply chains, information systems, and disaster management. It also covers balanced scorecards, multiple criteria analysis, simulation, data envelopment analysis, and financial risk measures that help assess risk, thereby enabling a well-informed managerial decision making. The book concludes by looking at four case studies, which cover a wide range of topics. These include such practical issues as the development and implementation of a sound risk management structure; supply chain risk and enterprise resource planning systems in information systems, and disaster management.

本书将风险管理的范畴从保险和金融扩展至会计风险、恐怖主义等可能威胁组织的各类问题。全书从五个维度展开论述：除财务风险管理这一核心视角外，还涵盖会计、供应链、信息系统及灾害管理的多维视角。书中详细探讨了平衡计分卡、多准则分析法、模拟仿真、数据包络分析等风险评估工具，以及金融风险度量方法，为管理决策提供科学依据。最后通过四个跨领域案例研究收尾，涉及健全风险管理体系的构建与实施、信息系统中的供应链风险与企业资源规划系统、以及灾害管理等实践议题。
