This paper studies the risk of collision between asteroids and Earth. It focuses on uncertainty in the human consequences of asteroid collisions, with emphasis on the possibility of global catastrophe to human civilization. A detailed survey of the asteroid risk literature shows that while human consequences are recognized as a major point of uncertainty, the studies focus mainly on physical and environmental dimensions of the risk. Some potential human consequences are omitted entirely, such as the possibility of asteroid explosions inadvertently causing nuclear war. Other human consequences are modeled with varying degrees of detail. Direct medical effects are relatively well-characterized, while human consequences of global environmental effects are more uncertain. The latter are evaluated mainly in terms of a global catastrophe threshold, but such a threshold is deeply uncertain and may not even exist. To handle threshold uncertainty in asteroid policy, this paper adapts the concept of policy boundaries from literature on anthropogenic global environmental change (i.e., planetary boundaries). The paper proposes policy boundaries of 100m asteroid diameter for global environmental effects and 1m for inadvertent nuclear war. Other policy implications include a more aggressive asteroid risk mitigation policy and measures to avoid inadvertent nuclear war. The paper argues that for rare events like large asteroid collisions, the absence of robust data means that a wide range of possible human consequences should be considered. This implies humility for risk analysis and erring on the side of caution in policy.

本文研究了小行星与地球相撞的风险，重点关注小行星撞击对人类影响的不确定性，尤其是对人类文明造成全球性灾难的可能性。通过对小行星风险文献的系统梳理发现，尽管人类影响被公认为主要的不确定因素，但现有研究仍集中于风险的物理与环境维度。某些潜在的人类影响被完全忽略，例如小行星爆炸意外引发核战争的可能性。其他人类影响的建模精细程度参差不齐——直接的医学效应已得到较好刻画，而全球环境效应引发的人类后果则存在更大不确定性。后者主要通过全球灾难阈值进行评估，但该阈值本身具有高度不确定性，甚至可能根本不存在。为应对小行星政策中的阈值不确定性，本文借鉴了人为全球环境变化研究（即行星边界理论）中的政策边界概念，提出针对全球环境效应的政策边界设为100米直径小行星，针对意外核战争的边界设为1米。其他政策建议包括实施更积极的小行星风险缓解政策，以及防范意外核战争的措施。本文指出，对于大型小行星撞击等罕见事件，由于缺乏可靠数据，应考虑各种可能的人类影响。这意味着风险分析需保持谦逊态度，政策制定应秉持谨慎原则。
