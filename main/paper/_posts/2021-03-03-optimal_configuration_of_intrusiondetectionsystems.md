An important requirement of an intrusion detection system (IDS) is that it be effective and efficient; that is, it should detect a large percentage of intrusions, while still keeping the false alarm rate at an acceptable level. In order to meet this requirement, the model and algorithm used by the IDS need to be calibrated or configured. The optimal configuration depends on several factors. The first factor is the quality profile of the IDS as indicated by its ROC (receiver operating characteristics), curve that relates the detection accuracy and the false alarm rate. The shape of the ROC curve depends on the detection technology used by the IDS. The second factor is the cost structure of the firm using the IDS. The third factor is the strategic behavior of hackers. A hacker’s behavior is influenced by the likelihood that (s)he will be caught, which, in turn, is dependent on the configuration of the IDS. In this article, we present an economic optimization model based on game theory that provides insights into optimal configuration of IDS. We present analytical as well as computational results. Our work extends the growing literature on the economics of information security. The main innovation of our approach is the inclusion of strategic interactions between IDS, firm, and hackers in the determination of optimal configuration and algorithm to do so.

入侵检测系统(IDS)的一个重要要求是高效且有效，即应在保持误报率处于可接受水平的同时检测出大部分入侵行为。为满足这一要求，需对IDS采用的模型和算法进行校准或配置。最优配置取决于若干因素：首要因素是IDS的质量特征，这体现为其ROC曲线(接收者操作特征曲线)，该曲线反映了检测准确率与误报率之间的关系。ROC曲线的形态取决于IDS采用的检测技术；其次是企业使用IDS的成本结构；第三是黑客的战略行为。黑客行为受其被捕获概率的影响，而该概率又取决于IDS的配置方案。本文提出基于博弈论的经济优化模型，为IDS最优配置提供理论依据，并展示分析性与计算性研究成果。我们的工作拓展了信息安全经济学领域不断增长的文献体系。本方法的主要创新点在于：在确定最优配置及相应算法时，综合考虑了IDS、企业及黑客三者间的战略互动关系。
