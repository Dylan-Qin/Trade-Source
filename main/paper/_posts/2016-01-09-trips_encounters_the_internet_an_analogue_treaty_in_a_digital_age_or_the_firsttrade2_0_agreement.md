As the internet assumes a central place in commerce, communications and governance, with a strong international dimension, how does the TRIPS Agreement appear now - is it 'wired' - a timely trade pact that foreshadowed the growth in trade in IP; or 'tired' - an approach to IP regulation that is rooted in a bygone world of discrete national jurisdictions and an assumption that trade in IP can be regulated as a subset of trade in goods; or indeed 'expired', superseded by a new commercial and information space that renders redundant notions of sovereign borders and 'trade' as essentially an exchange in physical goods? Is TRIPS essentially an analogue era treaty in a digital age (using these terms in a mostly metaphorical sense), or was it a forward looking, even prescient, trade agreement, hard-wired, as it were, to retrofit the internet and the rise in trade in digital products?

随着互联网在商业、通信和治理中占据核心地位，并具有强烈的国际维度，《与贸易有关的知识产权协定》（TRIPS）如今呈现出何种面貌——它是"与时俱进"（wired）的，即预见了知识产权贸易增长的及时贸易协定；还是"过时"（tired）的，即植根于已逝去的离散国家管辖世界，并假设知识产权贸易可作为货物贸易子集进行监管的旧式知识产权规制方法；甚或已然"失效"（expired），被新的商业和信息空间所取代，这种空间使主权边界概念和本质上作为实体货物交换的"贸易"概念变得冗余？TRIPS本质上究竟是数字时代的模拟时代条约（此处主要使用隐喻意义），还是具有前瞻性甚至先见之明的贸易协定——仿佛其本身就内置了适配互联网和数字产品贸易崛起的机制？
