It has become increasingly common to produce goods in a number of geographically dispersed stages linked by international trade. This tendency, known by names such as “production fragmentation,” “processing trade,” and “vertical specialization,” has important implications for the analysis of non-tariff measures (NTMs) and trade facilitation. First, different types of NTMs or trade facilitation issues are naturally associated with different stages in the movement of goods. Different price gaps can be assigned to these stages, making it possible to decompose the overall amount of distortion and to prioritize the policies with the largest potential efficiency gains. Second, NTMs may accumulate in long supply chains, implying that their trade-distorting effects are greater for goods produced in a fragmented manner than for goods with simple production processes. There is evidence that trade costs are more important for high technology goods or goods undergoing several stages of processing. Issues with product standards may be particularly important for goods with long supply chains. The link between NTMs and supply chains also has implications for economic development and for the relationship between liberalization in services and goods.

通过国际贸易将地理上分散的多个生产环节连接起来的商品制造方式日益普遍。这种被称为"生产分割""加工贸易"或"垂直专业化"的趋势，对非关税措施和贸易便利化的分析具有重要意义。首先，不同类型的非关税措施或贸易便利化问题自然对应货物流动的不同环节。可将不同的价格差异归因于这些环节，从而分解总体扭曲程度，并优先考虑可能带来最大效率提升的政策。其次，非关税措施可能在长供应链中累积，意味着其对分段生产商品的贸易扭曲效应大于简单生产流程的商品。有证据表明，贸易成本对高科技产品或需多道加工工序的商品更为重要。产品标准问题对长供应链商品可能尤为关键。非关税措施与供应链的关联还对经济发展以及服务与货物贸易自由化之间的关系具有启示意义。
