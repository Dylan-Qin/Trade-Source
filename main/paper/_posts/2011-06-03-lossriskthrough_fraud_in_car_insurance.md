Our objective is to analyse fraud as an operational risk for the insurance company. We study the effect of a fraud detection policy on the insurer's results account, quantifying the loss risk from the perspective of claims auditing. From the point of view of operational risk, the study aims to analyse the effect of failing to detect fraudulent claims after investigation. We have chosen VAR as the risk measure with a non-parametric estimation of the loss risk involved in the detection or non-detection of fraudulent claims. The most relevant conclusion is that auditing claims reduces loss risk in the insurance company.

我们的目标是分析欺诈行为对保险公司作为运营风险的影响。我们研究了欺诈检测政策对保险公司业绩账户的作用，从理赔审核的角度量化了损失风险。从运营风险的角度出发，该研究旨在分析调查后未能发现欺诈性索赔的影响。我们选择VAR作为风险度量指标，并对欺诈索赔检测或未检测所涉及的损失风险进行了非参数估计。最相关的结论是，审核索赔能降低保险公司的损失风险。
