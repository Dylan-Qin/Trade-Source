China’s importance for India as a trading partner has increased tremendously over the recent years. At the same time, China has become the main target of Indian antidumping measures with a number of measures that is unprecedented worldwide. This paper provides a detailed analysis of trade flows between the two emerging economies and investigates on which type of products and in which sectors the Indian government applies antidumping measures against China. Then this paper estimates the trade impact of those measures that were imposed during the Great Recession, using monthly data on exports from China to India. The use of monthly data is relatively new to the literature and allows a detailed examination of the trade impact of antidumping measures and its dynamics. This paper finds that antidumping measures decrease the Chinese export value and quantity to India immediately and to a significant extent. The impact is quite stable over time.

近年来，中国作为印度贸易伙伴的重要性大幅提升。与此同时，中国已成为印度反倾销措施的主要目标国，其针对中国实施的反倾销案件数量在全球范围内前所未有。本文详细分析了这两个新兴经济体之间的贸易流动，探究了印度政府对中国实施反倾销措施的产品类别与行业领域。随后，通过中国对印度出口的月度数据，本文评估了经济大衰退期间印度反倾销措施产生的贸易影响。采用月度数据在现有文献中较为新颖，有助于细致考察反倾销措施的贸易影响及其动态变化。研究发现，反倾销措施会立即且显著降低中国对印度的出口额与出口量，且这种影响随时间推移保持稳定。
