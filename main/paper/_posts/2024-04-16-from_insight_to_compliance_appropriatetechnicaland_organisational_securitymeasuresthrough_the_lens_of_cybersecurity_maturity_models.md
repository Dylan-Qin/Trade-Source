Cybersecurity is a much-debated topic in both technical and legal scholarship. With contemporary business models hinging on highly performant information systems, there is increased awareness among entrepreneurs that security incidents often have devastating consequences on undertakings’ revenue streams, intellectual property, and brand reputation. As a result, there is an increased focus on the obligation to implement cybersecurity measures. In the context of the GDPR, cybersecurity obligations seem to converge on the requirement to deploy ‘appropriate technical and organisational measures’ in order to ensure a level of security commensurate with the risks posed to an organisation. Yet, given the complex and rapidly evolving nature of the subject matter, the precise meaning and scope of these obligations remain unclear. This contribution offers guidance on how to assess the concept of ‘appropriate technical and organisational measures’ by considering it through the lens of cybersecurity maturity models. Accordingly, this article provides anchorage to scholarly audiences when scrutinizing the extent to which privacy and security measures qualify as ‘appropriate’ in the context of liability claims and actions for damages, thereby creating an opportunity to move from technical insight to legal compliance.

网络安全是技术和法律学术界广泛讨论的话题。随着当代商业模式依赖于高性能信息系统，企业家们日益意识到安全事件往往对企业的收入来源、知识产权和品牌声誉造成毁灭性影响。因此，实施网络安全措施的义务受到更多关注。在《通用数据保护条例》（GDPR）框架下，网络安全义务似乎集中于部署"适当技术和组织措施"的要求，以确保与组织面临风险相匹配的安全水平。然而，鉴于该主题的复杂性和快速演变特性，这些义务的确切含义和范围仍不明确。本文通过网络安全成熟度模型的视角，为如何评估"适当技术和组织措施"概念提供指导。因此，这篇文章为学术界在审查隐私与安全措施是否符合责任索赔和损害赔偿诉讼中"适当"标准时提供了依据，从而创造了从技术认知转向法律合规的契机。
