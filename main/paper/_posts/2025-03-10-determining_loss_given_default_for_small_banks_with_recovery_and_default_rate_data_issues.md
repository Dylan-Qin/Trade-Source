The financial stability of small banks is increasingly scrutinized in light of their vulnerabilities to credit losses, particularly during periods of economic downturn. Understanding the determinants of Loss Given Default (LGD) is crucial for accurately assessing the risk profiles of these institutions. This is compounded by difficulties in obtaining reliable recovery and default rate data, which are essential to inform lending practices and regulatory compliance. Research indicates that cultural proximity between lenders and borrowers can significantly influence credit dynamics, reducing default rates and facilitating better repayment outcomes(Fisman R et al., 2017). Moreover, the rise of advanced financial instruments has introduced complexity into how credit risks are evaluated, suggesting an urgent need for frameworks that account for these evolving conditions(Marti G Subrahmanyam et al., 2014). Consequently, this essay aims to elucidate the challenges faced by small banks in determining LGD, emphasizing the necessity for robust analytical approaches to navigate data-related impediments.

小型银行的财务稳定性正因其对信贷损失的脆弱性而受到日益严格的审视，尤其是在经济衰退时期。准确评估这些机构的风险状况，关键在于理解违约损失率（LGD）的决定因素。而获取可靠的回收率和违约率数据存在困难，这进一步加剧了问题的复杂性，此类数据对指导贷款实践和监管合规至关重要。研究表明，贷款方与借款方之间的文化亲近性能显著影响信贷动态，降低违约率并促成更佳的还款结果（Fisman R等，2017）。此外，先进金融工具的兴起为信用风险评估方式增添了复杂性，这表明亟需建立能够适应这些演变条件的分析框架（Marti G Subrahmanyam等，2014）。因此，本文旨在阐明小型银行在确定违约损失率时面临的挑战，并强调采用强健分析方法以克服数据相关障碍的必要性。
