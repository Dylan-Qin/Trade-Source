Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) has emerged as a construct that ostensibly overcomes limitations of silo-based traditional risk management (TRM), yet little is known about its effectiveness.  The scant research on the relationship between ERM and firm performance has offered mixed findings, and has been limited by the lack of a suitable proxy for the degree of ERM implementation. Using Standard and Poor’s (S&P) newly available risk management rating, we find evidence of a positive relation between increasing levels of TRM capability and firm value but no additional increase in value for firms achieving a higher ERM rating. Considering these results, we suggest directions for future research.

企业风险管理（ERM）作为一种看似能克服传统孤岛式风险管理（TRM）局限性的框架应运而生，但其实际效果尚不明确。目前关于ERM与企业绩效关系的研究不仅数量稀少且结论不一，更因缺乏衡量ERM实施程度的合适指标而受限。通过采用标准普尔（S&P）新近推出的风险管理评级体系，本研究发现TRM能力提升与企业价值存在正向关联，但获得更高ERM评级的企业并未实现额外价值增长。基于这些发现，我们为未来研究提出了方向建议。
