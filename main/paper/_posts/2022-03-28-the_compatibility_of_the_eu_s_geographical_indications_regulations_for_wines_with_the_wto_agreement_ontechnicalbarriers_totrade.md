The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) sets a floor but not a ceiling for intellectual property protection. Examining the EU’s geographical indications regime for wines, this article considers the question of when a World Trade Organization member’s measures taken to implement the TRIPS Agreement might contravene the member’s obligations under the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement). A technical regulation apparently permitted by the TRIPS Agreement may be inconsistent with the TBT Agreement where it does not in good faith pursue a legitimate objective or where it is incongruent with or poorly calibrated to its objective. In particular, the compatibility with the TBT Agreement of EU regulations that prohibit the labelling of wines with the relevant grape variety where the variety ‘contains or consists of’, ‘evokes’ or ‘forms an integral part of’ a GI is open to doubt.

《与贸易有关的知识产权协定》（TRIPS协定）为知识产权保护设定了下限而非上限。本文通过考察欧盟葡萄酒地理标志保护制度，探讨了世贸组织成员为实施TRIPS协定而采取的措施在何种情形下可能违反其在《技术性贸易壁垒协定》（TBT协定）下的义务。一项表面符合TRIPS协定的技术法规，若未真诚追求合法目标，或与其目标不相称、匹配失当，则可能与TBT协定相抵触。特别是欧盟禁止在葡萄酒标签上使用"包含或构成"、"暗示"或"构成组成部分"地理标志的葡萄品种名称之规定，其与TBT协定的兼容性值得商榷。
