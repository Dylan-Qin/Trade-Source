The frequent occurrence of major emergencies causes credit default and its contagion among counterparties in the financial market, which is of great importance to the study of counterparty credit risk contagion control under the impact of major emergencies. In view of this background, this study constructed the SIs-EIeRS model of counterparty credit risk contagion caused by major emergencies on the basis of complex network theory and the infectious disease model. This research also analyzed the mechanism and evolution characteristics of counterparty credit risk contagion through theoretical deduction and computational simulation. On this basis, we combined the Mansfield diffusion model and nonlinear system dynamics theory, constructed the counterparty credit risk contagion control model under the impact of major emergencies, and analyzed the evolution characteristics and optimal control strategy selection of counterparty credit risk contagion control under major emergencies through theoretical deduction and computational simulation. The results showed the following. 1) When the recombination rate of bankrupt credit subjects is small, the default rate of the normal credit subject without the impact of major emergencies and the impact strength of major emergencies is small. Furthermore, the counterparty credit risk contagion scale decreases with the increase of the impact strength of major emergencies. However, in other cases, the counterparty credit risk contagion scale increases with the impact strength of major emergencies. 2) Under the differential influence of major emergencies on the default rate, bankruptcy rate, and recovery rate of the affected credit subjects, the evolution of the counterparty credit risk contagion scale tends to increase or decrease first and then increase with the increase of the impact strength of major emergencies. 3) Under the four types of control strategies, namely, pre-prevention control, blocking control, lagging recovery control, and comprehensive control, the counterparty credit risk contagion scale increases first and then decreases to the stable target value. However, the stable control level of counterparty credit risk contagion is different. 4) Considering the effect of counterparty credit risk contagion control and social resource consumption comprehensively, both lagging recovery control strategy and comprehensive control strategy may be the optimal strategies, and different optimal strategies may be selected with the change of contagion conditions under the impact of major emergencies.

重大突发事件频发引发金融市场交易对手信用违约及其传染，对重大突发事件冲击下交易对手信用风险传染控制研究具有重要意义。鉴于此背景，本研究基于复杂网络理论和传染病模型构建了重大突发事件引发交易对手信用风险传染的SIs-EIeRS模型，通过理论推导和计算仿真分析了交易对手信用风险传染机理及演化特征。在此基础上，结合Mansfield扩散模型和非线性系统动力学理论，构建了重大突发事件冲击下交易对手信用风险传染控制模型，通过理论推导和计算仿真分析了重大突发事件下交易对手信用风险传染控制的演化特征及最优控制策略选择。研究结果表明：1）当破产信用主体重组率较小，且未受重大突发事件冲击的正常信用主体违约率与重大突发事件冲击强度较小时，交易对手信用风险传染规模随重大突发事件冲击强度增大而减小；其余情形下交易对手信用风险传染规模随重大突发事件冲击强度增大而增大。2）在重大突发事件对受冲击信用主体违约率、破产率及恢复率差异化影响下，交易对手信用风险传染规模演化趋势随重大突发事件冲击强度增大呈现先减小后增大或持续增大的特征。3）在预先防范控制、阻断控制、滞后恢复控制及综合控制四类策略下，交易对手信用风险传染规模均先增大后减小至稳定目标值，但交易对手信用风险传染的稳定控制水平存在差异。4）综合考虑交易对手信用风险传染控制效果与社会资源消耗，滞后恢复控制策略与综合控制策略均可能成为最优策略，且随重大突发事件冲击下传染条件变化可能选择不同最优策略。
