New information and communication technologies have developed significantly, and now wield considerable influence on the traditional commodity trade. The concept of digital trade has emerged around the world and has drawn global attention. Digital trade is a form of trade in which information and communication technology plays an important role. The characteristics of digital trade are, for the most part, twofold.First is the digitalization of the method of exchange. Information and communication technologies have changed the way traditional trade is conducted, and e-commerce platforms have become an important hub for international trade. Information display, trade negotiations, payments and settlements and tax clearance are done online, greatly reducing trade costs and improving efficiency.The second is the digitization of trade goods, that is, the digital services trade: data and products in the form of data. Services are traded globally through information and communication networks, and their impact on production and transaction continues to expand. Recently, new technologies such as cloud computing and big data continue to develop, and the content of digital trade is diversifying continuously, especially in China and the U.S. The importance of digital trade has also grown. Moreover, China has increased its digital trade and influence in different regions by promoting its Belt and Road project. Accordingly, this paper seeks to grasp digital trade and analyzes the digital trade in China, dividing it into digital product (software) trade, digital service trade and e-commerce trade.This study concludes with a description of the implications for policy carried by the results of the analysis.

新型信息通信技术发展迅猛，对传统商品贸易产生显著影响。数字贸易概念已在全球范围内兴起并引发广泛关注。数字贸易是一种信息通信技术发挥重要作用的贸易形式，其核心特征主要体现在两个方面：首先是交易方式的数字化。信息通信技术改变了传统贸易的开展模式，电子商务平台成为国际贸易的重要枢纽，信息展示、贸易洽谈、支付结算及通关纳税均在线完成，大幅降低贸易成本并提升效率。其次是贸易标的的数字化，即数字服务贸易：以数据形式存在的数据及产品通过信息通信网络进行全球交易，其对生产与交易的影响持续扩大。近年来，随着云计算、大数据等新技术不断发展，数字贸易内涵持续丰富，在中美等国的重要性日益凸显。中国更通过推进"一带一路"建设，增强了在不同区域的数字贸易规模与影响力。基于此，本文旨在系统把握数字贸易内涵，将中国数字贸易划分为数字产品（软件）贸易、数字服务贸易和电子商务贸易三大类进行分析。研究最后根据分析结果阐述了相关政策启示。
