This paper investigates the potential to harness trade finance to foster the development of a green economy in developing countries. The world is facing multiple crises of sustainability: global financial crisis, climate change, and the overuse of natural resources. Many developing countries are additionally destabilized by poverty, disease, corruption, and failures in democratic governance and education. The transition to a green economy is recognized by a variety of organizations and experts as a ground-breaking way forward, combining economic development, social welfare and environmental protection. In order to shift to a green economy, changes in production and consumption practices, and therefore also in trade patterns, are crucial. This makes the leverage power of leading export credit agencies, which totaled an exposure of USD 1.7 trillion in 2011, colossal.

本文探讨了利用贸易融资促进发展中国家绿色经济发展的潜力。世界正面临多重可持续性危机：全球金融危机、气候变化以及自然资源的过度消耗。许多发展中国家还因贫困、疾病、腐败以及民主治理和教育体系的失效而陷入动荡。各类组织和专家均认同，向绿色经济转型是结合经济发展、社会福利与环境保护的创新之路。要实现绿色经济转型，改变生产消费模式及贸易格局至关重要。这使得主要出口信贷机构的杠杆力量（2011年总风险敞口达1.7万亿美元）具有巨大影响力。
