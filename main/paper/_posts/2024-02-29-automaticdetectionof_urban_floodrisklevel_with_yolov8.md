Urban flooding poses significant threats to lives, properties and transportation facilities, and accurate and timely flood information is critical to city decision-making.With the widespread use of 5G and surveillance cameras in cities, video image is becoming a new data source and showing great potential in urban flood monitoring. This study introduces a methodology for assessing the risk of flooding by recognizing the submerged state of cars in video images. Initially, the vehicle flooding status is categorized into five distinct classes, each corresponding to a specific urban flood risk level. A dataset comprising 2,000 images featuring 6,000 vehicles was compiled and annotated for this purpose. Subsequently, four variations based on the YOLOv8 framework were evaluated in recognizing the car submerged state. This investigation also entails determining the optimal model configurations for YOLOv8 across varying environmental conditions, facilitated through rigorous training evaluations and the verification of detection accuracy in complex scenarios. Furthermore, this research examines the influence of sample size and annotation precision on model training outcomes and overall performance. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness and applicability of our method in urban flood monitoring, and provides new ideas for video image-based flood detection research.

城市内涝对生命、财产和交通设施构成重大威胁，准确及时的积水信息对城市决策至关重要。随着5G和监控摄像头在城市中的普及，视频图像正成为新型数据源，在城市内涝监测中展现出巨大潜力。本研究提出了一种通过识别视频图像中车辆淹没状态来评估内涝风险的方法。首先将车辆涉水状态划分为五个等级，每个等级对应特定的城市内涝风险水平，为此构建并标注了包含2,000张图像、涉及6,000辆车辆的数据集。随后评估了基于YOLOv8框架的四种变体在识别车辆淹没状态中的表现。研究还通过严格的训练评估和复杂场景下的检测精度验证，确定了YOLOv8在不同环境条件下的最佳模型配置。此外，本研究探讨了样本数量和标注精度对模型训练效果及整体性能的影响。我们的研究验证了该方法在城市内涝监测中的有效性和适用性，为基于视频图像的积水检测研究提供了新思路。
