There are times when a forensic scientist may not be comfortable drawing a firm conclusion about whether a questioned sample that appears to contain useful identifying information did or did not come from a particular known source. In such cases, the forensic scientist may call the sample pair “inconclusive.”  We suggest that signal detection theory (SDT), which is concerned with the detection of weak signals in noisy environments, provides a useful framework for understanding the role that inconclusives play in the various feature-matching forensic sciences. SDT shows that “inconclusive” is often an appropriate response depending on both the strength of the signal in the samples and the thresholds adopted by the examiner. We also argue that inconclusives should not be coded as either correct or incorrect when tabulating forensic error rates.

有时，法医科学家可能无法自信地就一个看似包含有用识别信息的待检样本是否来自特定已知来源得出明确结论。在这种情况下，法医科学家可能会将样本对标记为"无法确定"。我们认为信号检测理论（SDT）——该理论关注在嘈杂环境中检测微弱信号——为理解"无法确定"结论在各种特征匹配法证科学中的作用提供了有效框架。SDT表明，根据样本中信号强度及检验员设定的阈值，"无法确定"往往是恰当的回应。我们还主张在统计法证错误率时，不应将"无法确定"归类为正确或错误。
