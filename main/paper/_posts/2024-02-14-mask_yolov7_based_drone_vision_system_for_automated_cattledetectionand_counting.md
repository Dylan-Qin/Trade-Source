Conventional method of counting animals is one of the most challenging tasks in livestock management; moreover, counting of animals in drone acquired imagery though promising, is more challenging in intelligent livestock management. In this paper, we apply state-of-the-art object detection model, Mask YOLOv7, for detection and counting of cattle in different scenarios such as in controlled (feedlot) environment and uncontrolled (open-range) environment. Mask mechanism was embedded into the backbone of the YOLOv7 algorithm (Mask YOLOv7) for instance segmentation of individual cattle object. We evaluate the performance of the model proposed in this study using IoU (Intersection over Union) threshold of 0.5, average precision (AP) and mean average precision (mAP). The results of the experiment conducted in this study show that the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 93% in counting cattle in controlled environment and 95% in uncontrolled environment. These results affirm the potential of the model, Mask YOLOv7, to perform competitively with any other existing object detection and instance segmentation models in terms of accuracy and average precision especially when the speed of object detection matters. Moreover, the research has potential applications in livestock inventory which helps in tracking, monitoring and reporting vital information about individual cattle.

传统的动物计数方法是畜牧管理中最具挑战性的任务之一；此外，尽管无人机获取图像中的动物计数前景广阔，但在智能畜牧管理中更具挑战性。本文应用最先进的目标检测模型Mask YOLOv7，在受控（饲养场）和非受控（开放牧场）等不同场景下进行牛的检测与计数。该研究将掩码机制嵌入YOLOv7算法主干网络（Mask YOLOv7），实现了对单个牛目标的实例分割。我们采用0.5交并比（IoU）阈值、平均精度（AP）和均值平均精度（mAP）评估了所提模型的性能。实验结果表明：该模型在受控环境下牛群计数准确率达93%，在非受控环境下达95%。这些数据证实了Mask YOLOv7模型在准确率和平均精度方面可与现有任何目标检测及实例分割模型竞争，尤其在检测速度关键时表现突出。该研究在牲畜库存管理方面具有应用潜力，有助于跟踪、监测和报告个体牛的重要信息。
