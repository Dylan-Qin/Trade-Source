The trend of weaponizing trade measures has become an increasingly serious issue, as demonstrated by several recent cases within the WTO. These cases represent only a fraction of the broader phenomenon, with many similar instances occurring outside the scope of WTO regulations. Key factors driving this trend include the expanding definition of national security and the rise of unilateral trade sanctions. Such practices have already had a profound negative impact on the multilateral trading system. Without effective measures to curb this trend, it will pose an even greater threat to the already fragile international trade system. In such a context, this article critically analyzes the current state of trade measure weaponization and proposes seven countermeasures to address this issue.

将贸易措施武器化的趋势已成为日益严重的问题，世贸组织近期处理的若干案例便印证了这一点。这些案例仅是更广泛现象的冰山一角，许多类似事件发生在世贸组织监管范围之外。推动这一趋势的关键因素包括国家安全概念的持续扩大以及单边贸易制裁的兴起。此类做法已对多边贸易体系造成深远的负面影响。若不采取有效措施遏制这一趋势，将对本就脆弱的国际贸易体系构成更大威胁。在此背景下，本文批判性分析了贸易措施武器化的现状，并提出了应对该问题的七项对策。
