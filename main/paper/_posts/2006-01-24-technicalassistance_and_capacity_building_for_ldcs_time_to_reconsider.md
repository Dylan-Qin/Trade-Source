In the run up to the Hong Kong (HK) Ministerial Meeting of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), growing attention has been paid to the needs of developing countries, especially the least developed countries (LDCs) many of whom face deep and persistent poverty and indebtedness. Judging from the draft Ministerial Text submitted by Chairman of the General Council (GC) and the Director-General (DG) to the WTO members in anticipation of the HK Ministerial Meeting, the concern about the plight of the LDCs seems to have increased considerably. There is a need for initiating measures to improve the trade related technical assistance (TRTA) and trade related capacity building (TRCB). While calling for improved aid is laudable and urgently needed, at the same time member countries should take a step back and reflect on what has been done so far in the name of TRTA in order to reach an agreement on TRTA at the HK Ministerial Meeting which will have sufficient chances of actually leading to sustained improvement of living conditions in the LDCs.

在世界贸易组织（WTO）香港部长级会议召开前夕，发展中国家尤其是最不发达国家（LDCs）的需求日益受到关注，这些国家大多深陷长期贫困与债务困境。从总理事会（GC）主席和总干事（DG）为筹备香港部长级会议向WTO成员提交的《部长宣言草案》来看，对最不发达国家困境的关注度已显著提升。当前亟需启动措施以改进贸易相关技术援助（TRTA）和贸易相关能力建设（TRCB）。尽管呼吁增加援助值得赞许且迫在眉睫，但各成员国也应回溯反思过往以TRTA名义开展的各项行动，以便在香港部长级会议上达成真正有望持续改善最不发达国家生活条件的TRTA协议。
