Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is recognized as an essential technology for mitigating global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), and offers a viable pathway toward a low-carbon economy. Canada has emerged as a leader in CCS, with several operational projects and significant planned investments. However, public perception remains a persistent challenge, largely due to concerns about CO2 containment, as highlighted by incidents such as the historical Kerr complaints in Weyburn, Canada, where false leakage allegations led to extensive investigations.The success of CCS projects lies in the implementation of robust Measurement, Monitoring, and Verification (MMV) systems. Such systems ensure the safety and security of injected CO2. Surface MMV, specifically the comparison of surface soil gas emission patterns to pre-injection baselines, plays a key role in gaining public trust, as it provides insight into natural variability and demonstrates the ability to detect potential leaks. The Aquistore project is a state-of-the-art CCS science project in Saskatchewan, Canada, designed to test, among other things, the efficacy of MMV programs. The surface soil-gas MMV program at Aquistore uses mainly process-based indicators, including gas concentrations of CO2, oxygen (O2), nitrogen (N2), and the radiocarbon isotope CO2 (14CO2). Unlike other sites, these parameters were measured extensively in a pre-injection baseline study and subsequently monitored post-injection at regular bi-annual intervals.This paper examines the strengths and challenges of the process-based MMV approach while highlighting the role of adaptability over time, as demonstrated by the Aquistore experience. Since 2012, the surface soil-gas MMV program has evolved to address the changing project needs, integrating an adaptive sampling strategy that reduced resource demands while maintaining data integrity. Over a decade, a well-established baseline dataset, including pre-injection measurements, proved essential for accurate interpretation. Although no baseline geochemical surface soil-gas MMV research at this site has shown evidence of surface impacts due to CO2 injection, pre- and post-injection monitoring consistently identified old 14CO2 values. Initially, these 14CO2 signatures appeared to indicate fossil-sourced CO2 rising to the surface in parts of the monitoring area. However, further investigation revealed that these anomalous 14CO2 signatures predated injection and were linked to the microbial decomposition of weathered coal fragments from historic surface coal mining at the site. Without the extensive and adaptive baseline monitoring dataset, these findings could have been misinterpreted, emphasizing the significance of an MMV approach that evolves throughout the project lifecycle to enhance the reliability of CCS monitoring programs.Despite the effectiveness, the existing integrated process-based framework and adaptive baseline MMV approach pose challenges, including labor intensity, surface detection limitations, and reliance on pre-existing data. Basin analysis at Aquistore has shown no significant preferential pathways between the storage site and the surface. However, risk assessments identified the most probable CO2 migration path along the injection and monitoring wells due to potential well integrity issues. To address these challenges, a partial shift to a risk-based monitoring approach is proposed in this paper, incorporating modern continuous sensor and algorithm systems to monitor high-risk areas continuously and non-invasively, with a proportional reduction in process-based sampling. These advanced systems, which were unavailable during the initial design of the Aquistore MMV program, provide a more targeted and maintainable solution by combining CO2 and CH4 sensors with Lagrangian back-trajectory algorithms to detect anomalies, minimizing false positives through geochemical ratios and spatial matching.Findings from Aquistore underscore the importance of adaptive and continuous baseline monitoring to avoid the pitfalls of misinterpretation, such as those seen in previous leak allegations at the Weyburn site. Ultimately, a well-conceived baseline MMV framework is less costly than responding to seepage allegations, reinforcing the importance of comprehensive MMV in successful CCS deployment.

碳捕集与封存（CCS）技术被公认为减少全球温室气体（尤其是二氧化碳）排放的关键技术，为实现低碳经济提供了可行路径。加拿大凭借多个运营项目及重大投资计划已成为该领域领导者，但公众接受度仍是持续挑战——这主要源于对二氧化碳封存安全性的担忧，如加拿大韦本地区克尔投诉事件所示，当时虚假泄漏指控引发了大规模调查。. . CCS项目的成功取决于健全的测量、监测与验证（MMV）体系的实施。其中地表土壤气体MMV通过对比注入前后的排放模式，在建立公众信任方面发挥关键作用，既能揭示自然变化规律，又能证明泄漏检测能力。位于加拿大萨斯喀彻温省的Aquistor项目是前沿CCS科研项目，其地表土壤气体MMV主要采用基于过程的指标监测体系，包括CO₂、氧气、氮气浓度及放射性碳同位素Δ¹⁴CO₂等参数。与其他项目不同，这些指标在注入前基线研究中已获全面测量，并实施每半年一次的注入后定期监测。. . 本文通过Aquistor案例，剖析了过程型MMV方法的优势与挑战，重点阐释了监测体系动态调适的重要性。自2012年以来，该项目地表土壤气体MMV方案通过自适应采样策略不断演进，在保障数据质量的同时降低了资源消耗。十年间积累的完整基线数据集（含注入前测量值）被证实对数据解读至关重要。尽管监测未发现CO₂注入导致的地表影响，但持续检出古老的Δ¹⁴CO₂值曾引发疑虑——初期这些特征疑似封存CO₂上涌，后续研究却揭示其源自历史露天煤矿遗留风化煤屑的微生物分解。若无全面动态的基线监测数据，这些发现可能被误判，凸显了MMV体系全周期演进对提升监测可靠性的价值。. . 现有过程型框架与自适应基线MMV方法虽成效显著，仍存在人力密集、地表探测局限及数据依赖性等挑战。Aquistor盆地分析显示封存层与地表间无显著优势通道，但风险评估指出井筒完整性隐患可能构成CO₂迁移路径。为此本文建议向风险导向型监测部分转型：在高风险区域部署现代连续传感器与算法系统进行非侵入式实时监测，相应减少过程型采样频次。这些技术（在项目设计初期尚未成熟）通过CO₂/CH₄传感器与拉格朗日反向轨迹算法联用，结合地球化学比值与空间匹配分析，可精准识别异常并降低误报率。. . Aquistor的实践印证了动态持续基线监测对避免误判的关键作用，韦本泄漏指控的教训由此得以规避。事实证明，完善的基线MMV框架成本远低于应对渗漏指控的代价，这再次验证了全面监测体系对CCS成功实施的决定性意义。
