In last decades, international trade has been characterized worldwide by a significant opening up, mainly based on the reduction of tariffs. However, simultaneously there has been an increase in non tariff measures (NTMs) notified to the WTO. Within this category they are technical barriers to trade (TBT) and sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS). The increasing importance of these requirements highlights the need to attend to the effects that SPS/TBT measures have on the flow of imports and exports. In order to address this matter, a literature review was made to consider the latest research in the field specifically in the case of food and agricultural sector. Finally, as an overall result the existence of a “dual” effect was shown regarding the relationship between SPS/TBT and food and agricultural international trade which depends on the trade-off between implementation costs and the benefits of a better positioning in an gradually more demanding market.

过去几十年间，全球国际贸易呈现出显著开放的特征，这主要得益于关税的降低。然而与此同时，向世界贸易组织(WTO)通报的非关税措施(NTMs)却有所增加，其中技术性贸易壁垒(TBT)和卫生与植物检疫措施(SPS)尤为突出。这些要求日益凸显的重要性，使得关注SPS/TBT措施对进出口流量的影响变得必要。为此，本文通过文献综述探讨了该领域的最新研究，特别是针对食品和农业部门的研究。最终总体结果表明：SPS/TBT与食品及农产品国际贸易之间存在"双重"效应，这种效应取决于实施成本与在日益严苛市场中获取更有利地位所带来的收益之间的权衡。
