The contribution of trade to development depends critically on the context in which trade works and the objectives it serves. No country has grown without trade. And with all economies becoming increasingly open against the backdrop of globalization, the role of trade in development is much more prominent. The Heads of State and Government at the 2005 World Summit reaffirmed their commitment to ensuring that trade plays its full part in promoting economic growth, employment and development for all. How can implementation of this commitment be monitored? The Trade and Development Index (TDI) responds to this question with an innovative conceptual and quantitative framework looking systematically at the interactions among different factors that determine trade and human development outcomes. The usefulness of the TDI lies in its integration of three key functions: monitoring the trade and development performance of countries; diagnosing and identifying factors affecting their performance; and providing a policy tool for national and international action to keep trade focused on development and poverty reduction.

贸易对发展的贡献在很大程度上取决于贸易运作的背景及其服务的目标。没有国家能在不进行贸易的情况下实现增长。在全球化的背景下，随着所有经济体日益开放，贸易在发展中的作用更加突出。2005年世界首脑会议上的各国元首和政府首脑重申了他们的承诺，即确保贸易在促进经济增长、就业和所有人的发展方面充分发挥作用。如何对这一承诺的执行情况进行监督？贸易和发展指数（TDI）通过一个创新的概念和量化框架来回答这个问题，系统地考察决定贸易和人类发展成果的不同因素之间的相互作用。TDI的实用性在于它整合了三个关键功能：监测各国的贸易和发展表现；诊断和识别影响其表现的因素；为国家和国际行动提供政策工具，使贸易始终聚焦于发展和减贫。
