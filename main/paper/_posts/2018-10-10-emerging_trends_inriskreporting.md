Risk management is a critical core issue among a variety of traditional financial institutions. Different institutions have grown with different objectives under different settings, and risk management has different historical strands of focus in institutions. This chapter reviews the traditional and evolving needs of the risk management function in light of the profound changes unfolding in the structural economic environment and the regulatory setting. Rapid consolidation and globalization in the past two decades have led to the evolution of deeply capitalized universal financial institutions that are home to a wide variety of products previously compartmentalized from Depression-era regulation. The development of a unifying framework for risk management to accommodate products and structures from disparate settings of the past is a major challenge. Adequacy and accuracy of risk measures have to be reevaluated for the current environment. The chapter discusses some alternatives that seem to be evolving in the market. Emphasis on standardization of risk measures across different products to accommodate aggregation is another challenge that has to be continually addressed.

风险管理是众多传统金融机构的核心关键议题。不同机构在不同环境下以不同目标发展壮大，风险管理在各机构中形成了差异化的历史关注脉络。本章结合经济结构环境和监管体系正在发生的深刻变革，回顾了风险管理职能的传统需求与演变趋势。过去二十年间快速推进的整合与全球化浪潮，催生了资本雄厚的全能型金融机构，这些机构汇聚了曾被大萧条时期监管政策分隔管理的各类金融产品。如何构建统一的风险管理框架以兼容历史不同时期形成的产品与结构，成为重大挑战。风险计量方法的适当性与精确性也需根据当前环境重新评估。本章探讨了市场上正在形成的一些替代方案。强调跨产品风险计量标准化以实现风险聚合，则是需要持续应对的另一项挑战。
