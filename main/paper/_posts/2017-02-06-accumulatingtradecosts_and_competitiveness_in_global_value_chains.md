Trade costs such as applied tariffs, transportation and insurance costs are amplified as they pass through the multiple production steps associated with modern supply chains. This so called "cascade effect" arises since trade costs accumulate as intermediate goods are imported and then re-exported further downstream, going through different processing nodes before reaching the final consumer. Moreover, the financial impact of these trade costs is magnified in the "trade in tasks" rationale which governs global value chains (GVCs). Specialised processing firms need to recoup the associated trade cost applying to the full value of the good from the smaller fraction of value-added created at each consecutive productive stage. This large relative weight of transaction expenses on the profitability of individual business operations explains why trade along GVCs is particularly exposed to trade costs. The paper reviews the implications of trade costs on competitiveness at industry, national and global levels. The financial implications of trade costs at firm and sectoral level are based on trade in value-added data for 2011. The multilateral welfare effects of reducing discrete trade costs are identified using a network analysis approach, which goes beyond the traditional bilateral dimension of international trade and identifies where trade facilitation investment would have the highest social returns from a GVC perspective. The authors conclude that while the direct benefits of trade facilitation will be proportionally higher for those countries that are not well integrated into international trade because of their high trade costs, the global benefits of trade facilitation investments will also be high if they are undertaken by key traders that lie at the core of global value chains.

诸如适用关税、运输和保险费用等贸易成本，在通过现代供应链的多个生产环节时会不断放大。这种所谓的“级联效应”之所以产生，是因为中间产品在进口后又被下游再次出口，经过不同加工节点最终到达终端消费者时，贸易成本会不断累积。此外，在支配全球价值链（GVCs）的“任务贸易”逻辑中，这些贸易成本的财务影响被进一步放大。专业化加工企业需要从每个连续生产阶段创造的较小增值部分中，收回适用于商品全部价值的相应贸易成本。交易费用对个体企业经营利润的这种巨大相对影响，解释了为何沿全球价值链进行的贸易尤其容易受到贸易成本的冲击。本文审视了贸易成本对行业、国家及全球层面竞争力的影响。基于2011年贸易增加值数据，研究量化了企业和行业层面贸易成本的财务影响。通过采用网络分析方法——该方法突破了传统国际贸易的双边维度，从全球价值链视角识别出贸易便利化投资能产生最高社会回报的节点——研究明确了降低离散型贸易成本带来的多边福利效应。作者得出结论：虽然贸易便利化的直接收益会因高贸易成本而与国际贸易融合度较低的国家成比例更高，但若处于全球价值链核心地位的关键贸易国实施便利化措施，其投资带来的全球收益同样将极为显著。
