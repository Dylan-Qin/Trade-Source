Behavioral economics has long been an important area of study as to how people make judgmental decisions. While effects from bias can often be corrected, it is more difficult to identify and correct for what might be described as noise As expanded upon by Kahneman and others in "Noise: A Flaw in Human Judgment" research suggests time of day, outdoor temperature, personal moods, desire to over-correct, and simple randomness can be behind how people arrive at judgmental forecasts and evaluations. This article illustrates the impact of noise on credit ratings and shows how their suggestions for conducting a noise audit, ensuring noise hygiene, and subsequent reduction of noise can be applied to credit risk ratings. The validity of credit risk ratings can improve from the perspective of these findings. All areas of credit risk management including credit underwriting, loan review, and credit audit would benefit.

长期以来，行为经济学一直是研究人们如何做出判断性决策的重要领域。虽然偏见的影响通常可以得到纠正，但更难识别和纠正的是所谓的"噪声"。正如卡尼曼等人在《噪声：人类判断的缺陷》中所阐述的，研究表明，一天中的时间、室外温度、个人情绪、过度纠正的欲望以及简单的随机性，都可能是人们做出判断性预测和评估背后的原因。本文阐述了噪声对信用评级的影响，并展示了如何将他们对进行噪声审计、确保噪声卫生以及随后减少噪声的建议应用于信用风险评级。从这些发现的角度来看，信用风险评级的有效性可以得到提高。信用风险管理的所有领域，包括信贷承销、贷款审查和信用审计，都将从中受益。
