This paper provides a systematic welfare-based approach to analyze the impact of non-tariff measures (NTMs) on trade and welfare in presence of market imperfections. We focus on standard-like measures such as technical barriers and sanitary and phytosanitary regulations. The approach overcomes the shortcomings of the mainstream approach based on the analysis of forgone trade caused by trade costs. The latter ignores market imperfections: welfare increases when NTMs are removed and trade expands. We explain how to account for external effects and market failures in trade-focused welfare analysis, leading to a more balanced overall assessment of measures despite a potential reduction of trade flows. We show that the relationship between trade, welfare, and NTMs is complex. The optimum NTM is often not zero. An application to shrimp trade illustrates the feasibility of the proposed approach. The illustration shows that the reinforcement of a food safety standard can be socially preferable to the status-quo situation, both domestically and internationally.

本文提出了一种基于福利的系统性方法，用于分析存在市场缺陷时非关税措施（NTMs）对贸易和福利的影响。我们重点关注技术性贸易壁垒、卫生与植物检疫法规等类标准措施。该方法克服了主流研究通过贸易成本分析所造成贸易损失这一路径的缺陷——后者忽视了市场缺陷的存在，简单认为取消非关税措施扩大贸易就能提升福利。我们阐述了如何在以贸易为核心的福利分析中纳入外部效应和市场失灵因素，从而对政策措施做出更全面的整体评估，即便这可能减少贸易流量。研究表明，贸易、福利与非关税措施之间存在复杂关联，最优非关税措施水平通常不为零。以虾类贸易为例的实证研究验证了本方法的可行性，该案例表明强化食品安全标准无论在国内还是国际层面，都可能成为比维持现状更具社会效益的选择。
