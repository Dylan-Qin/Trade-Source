Despite the widespread tariff reductions sparked by the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement, borders in the region remain thick, with many hurdles standing in the way of regional trade. Although anecdotal evidence suggests that nontariff measures raise trade costs and inhibit trade in the region, little is known about the magnitude of these economic effects. This paper uses a newly collected data set to quantify the incidence of sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical barriers to trade in the region and benchmarks it with other parts of the world. The results indicate that the Central American region has the lowest prevalence of technical nontariff measures in the world. However, there is significant heterogeneity of trade-related regulations in Central America; for instance, 48 percent of Salvadoran imports are subject to at least one nontariff measure, compared with just 16 percent of Honduran imports. The paper estimates the impact of these technical measures on border prices and finds that the price impact of sanitary and phytosanitary measures is equivalent to an ad-valorem tariff of 11.6 percent. This price-rising effect is further investigated by looking in detail at the impact of sanitary and phytosanitary measures on the prices of beef, chicken meat, bread, and dairy products in Guatemala. The impact is estimated to be equivalent to an ad-valorem tariff of 68.4 percent, 51.4 percent, 22.0 percent, and 5.0 percent, respectively. The paper shows that efforts to streamline key sanitary and phytosanitary measures affecting these products by, for example, reducing the cost and time required to obtain sanitary registries, would likely reduce the Guatemalan urban extreme poverty rate from 5.07 percent to 4.91 percent.

尽管《多米尼加共和国-中美洲自由贸易协定》引发了普遍的关税削减，但该地区的边界壁垒依然森严，区域贸易仍面临诸多障碍。虽有零星证据表明非关税措施推高了贸易成本并抑制区域贸易，但这些经济影响的具体程度尚不明确。本文通过新收集的数据集量化了该地区卫生与植物检疫措施及技术性贸易壁垒的发生率，并与全球其他地区进行对比。研究显示，中美洲地区技术性非关税措施的使用率为全球最低。然而中美洲各国贸易相关法规存在显著差异：例如萨尔瓦多48%的进口商品受至少一项非关税措施限制，而洪都拉斯这一比例仅为16%。本文估算了这些技术性措施对边境价格的影响，发现卫生与植物检疫措施的价格效应相当于11.6%的从价关税。通过具体分析卫生与植物检疫措施对危地马拉牛肉、鸡肉、面包和乳制品价格的影响，该研究进一步揭示了这种抬价效应——其等效从价关税分别达到68.4%、51.4%、22.0%和5.0%。研究表明，若通过降低卫生注册成本和时间等方式简化影响这些产品的关键卫生与植物检疫措施，危地马拉城市极端贫困率有望从5.07%降至4.91%。
