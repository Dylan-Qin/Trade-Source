This paper presents a theory on how firm structure responds to market competitiveness. Firms have often been observed to reallocate control rights, sometimes in response to market competition. We develop a theory on the dependence of firm structure on market competition using an incomplete contract approach. We show that a reallocation of control rights can be an effective way of adapting to changing market competitiveness. We find that when market competitiveness changes, depending on demand elasticity, firms may centralize or decentralize control rights to encourage work incentives or to control risk. We present a few case studies in support of this result. We also investigate the effect of changing demand elasticity and production cost on firm structure, as well as the effect of market competition on efficiency, incentives and risk control after taking into account the endogenous, competition-driven firm structure.

本文提出了一种关于企业结构如何响应市场竞争力的理论。我们经常观察到企业会重新分配控制权，有时是为了应对市场竞争。我们运用不完全契约方法，构建了一个关于企业结构依赖于市场竞争的理论。研究表明，控制权的重新分配可以成为适应市场竞争环境变化的有效方式。我们发现当市场竞争力发生变化时，根据需求弹性差异，企业可能通过集权或分权来激励工作积极性或控制风险。文中提供了若干支持这一结论的案例研究。我们还探讨了需求弹性和生产成本变化对企业结构的影响，以及在考虑内生性、竞争驱动的企业结构后，市场竞争对效率、激励和风险控制的作用。
