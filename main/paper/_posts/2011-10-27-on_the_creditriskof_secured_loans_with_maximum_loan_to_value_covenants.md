We propose a framework for analyzing the credit risk of secured loans under historical probability. We assume that the collateral cannot be liquidated immediately. Closed-form solutions for the expected loss are obtained for non-revolving loans. In the revolving case, we introduce a minimization problem with a loss function parameterized by a risk reluctance coefficient. We use stochastic control techniques to derive the Partial Integro-Differential Equation satisfied by the value function, and solve it numerically with a finite difference scheme. We exhibit optimal strategies and compare them with the standard LTV-based lending policy.

我们提出一个在历史概率下分析担保贷款信用风险的框架。假设抵押物无法立即变现。针对非循环贷款，我们获得了预期损失的闭式解。对于循环贷款情形，我们引入了一个由风险厌恶系数参数化的损失函数最小化问题。运用随机控制技术，推导出价值函数满足的偏积分微分方程，并采用有限差分法进行数值求解。我们展示了最优策略，并将其与基于贷款价值比的标准放贷政策进行比较。
