Much has been written about the objection originally formulated by Piero Sraffa to the use of production functions and aggregate capital and of the disputes that ensued, but there seems to be no systematic explanation in one place of why this objection is crucial to the foundations of economic theory and why the various attempts to escape it fail. This paper is an attempt provide one. First, it presents the reasoning of the objection and shows how the arguments against it are either fallacious or too restricted to be useful. Second, it shows how technical progress and international trade give two more reasons for the same objection, which, though logically independent, only became apparent because of the first.From these it follows that neither technical progress nor international trade can be plausibly described or explained if capital goods are not treated as heterogeneous goods manufactured with the use of capital goods. This leads to a more realistic depiction of technical progress as the outcome of the R&D of competing firms. (For brevity, government activities are left out.) The implications for international trade are described briefly.This paper is not a survey; it is confined to the minimum needed to establish its contentions. Its discussion of the disputes has mostly been said before, but it covers some gaps that seem to have been overlooked. It adds to the discussion in that the disputes did not take up the implications of technical progress and international trade.

关于皮耶罗·斯拉法最初对生产函数和总资本使用提出的异议及随后引发的争论，已有大量著述，但似乎尚未有系统性的解释集中阐述为何这一异议对经济理论的基础至关重要，以及为何各种试图回避它的尝试均告失败。本文旨在填补这一空白。首先，它阐述了该异议的逻辑，并指出反对意见要么存在谬误，要么适用范围过于局限而缺乏价值。其次，它揭示了技术进步和国际贸易为该异议提供的两个新论据——这两个论据虽在逻辑上独立，却因最初的异议才得以显现。由此可推知：若资本品不被视为利用资本品生产的异质商品，则技术进步与国际贸易均无法得到合理描述或解释。这进而引向对技术进步更现实的刻画——将其视为竞争企业研发活动的产物（为简洁起见，政府活动暂不讨论）。本文对国际贸易的影响也作了简要阐述。. . 本文并非综述性文章，仅围绕核心论点展开必要论述。关于争议的讨论大多前人有述，但补充了某些似乎被忽视的盲点。其创新之处在于：既往争议未涉及技术进步与国际贸易的理论影响。
