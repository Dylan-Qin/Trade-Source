As the third component of the Standardized Approach of the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book [1], the Residual Risk Add-On tries to capture the risks not covered by the other two components (Sensitivity Based Method and Default Risk Charge) and plays the role of Risk Not in VaR program or Risk Not in the Model Engines in previous market risk framework [2]. Following the paper [3] on the model risk of the Sensitivity Based Method, this paper investigates the performance of the Residual Risk Add-On in terms of identification, measurement and control of the residual risks, and finds that there exist arguments on the clarity of the criteria for instruments subject to residual risks and Residual Risk Add-On may significantly underestimate or overestimate the residual risks. The control for the Residual Risk Add-On program can be enhanced with some proposals to achieve optimal market risk management, especially for institutions which will not implement the Internal Model Method.

作为《交易账户基本审查标准化方法》的第三部分[1]，剩余风险附加项旨在捕捉其他两个组成部分（基于敏感度的方法和违约风险费用）未覆盖的风险，并在此前的市场风险框架中承担"未纳入VaR计划的风险"或"未纳入模型引擎的风险"角色[2]。继关于基于敏感度方法模型风险的论文[3]之后，本文研究了剩余风险附加项在剩余风险识别、计量和控制方面的表现，发现对于适用剩余风险工具的判定标准清晰度存在争议，且剩余风险附加项可能显著低估或高估剩余风险。通过若干优化建议可加强剩余风险附加项计划的控制效果，以实现最优市场风险管理，尤其对不采用内部模型法的机构具有特殊意义。
