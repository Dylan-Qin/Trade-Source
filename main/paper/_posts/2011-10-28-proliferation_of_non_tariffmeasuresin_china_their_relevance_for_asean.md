This paper explores the various non-tariff measures (NTMs) that co-exist in China and that directly influence imports into the country. Given the intensity and scope of technical measures imposed by China, the directional impacts of technical barriers to trade (TBTs) on bilateral ASEAN-China exports are investigated empirically using an augmented gravity model. The results imply that Chinese TBTs do have some trade depressing effects from the ASEAN perspective. However, sectoral trade effects of TBTs are important as dual effects exist even within some TBT intensive product groups. This informs the policy debate on the effects of NTMs from the ASEAN-China perspective more specifically, and the “South-South” context more generally on two fronts. First, the identification of specific trade restricting meaures for the affected sectors will assist in determining policy priorities within the ASEAN-China context. Second, trade facilitation measures that increase the business costs to the ASEAN exporters also warrant attention in addressing the scale of market access issues in China.

本文探讨了中国并存且直接影响进口的各类非关税措施(NTMs)。鉴于中国实施技术措施的强度与广度，研究采用扩展引力模型实证检验了技术性贸易壁垒(TBTs)对东盟-中国双边出口的定向影响。结果表明，从东盟视角看，中国的TBTs确实存在一定的贸易抑制效应。但TBTs的行业贸易效应具有重要性，因为即便在某些TBT密集型产品类别中也存在双重效应。这从两个层面为政策讨论提供了更具体的东盟-中国视角及更广义的"南南合作"背景下的NTMs影响分析：首先，识别受影响行业的具体贸易限制措施将有助于确定东盟-中国框架下的政策优先事项；其次，那些增加东盟出口商商业成本的贸易便利化措施，在解决中国市场准入规模问题时同样值得关注。
