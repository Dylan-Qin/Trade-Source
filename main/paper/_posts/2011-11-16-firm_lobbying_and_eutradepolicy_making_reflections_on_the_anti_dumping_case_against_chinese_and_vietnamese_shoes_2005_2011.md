It is an accepted view in the trade policy literature that those who lose from external trade are much more easily mobilized politically than those benefiting from it. As a consequence, the argument goes, there is an over-representation of protectionist interests in the political arena and a persistent pressure on policy-makers to shield their markets from foreign competition. However, I argue that under certain circumstances import-dependent firms may very well be able and willing to mobilize politically and defend their anti-protectionist trade interests in the political arena. I will use the recent EU anti-dumping case against Chinese and Vietnamese shoes to illustrate my argument.

贸易政策研究领域普遍认为，遭受对外贸易冲击的群体比获益者更容易形成政治动员力量。这种观点指出，保护主义利益在政治舞台上往往被过度代表，决策者因此持续承受着保护国内市场免受外国竞争的压力。然而笔者认为，在某些情况下，依赖进口的企业完全可能具备政治动员能力与意愿，在政治领域维护其反保护主义的贸易利益。本文将以欧盟近期对中国和越南鞋类产品发起的反倾销案为例，论证这一观点。
