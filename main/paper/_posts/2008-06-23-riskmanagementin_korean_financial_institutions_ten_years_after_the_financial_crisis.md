Risk characteristics of the Korean financial market have changed dramatically during the decade following the financial crisis in 1997. First of all, credit risk in the large corporate sector has decreased significantly after turmoil in the corporate bond market in 1999 and 2000. Second, credit risk in the small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) sector has been continuously deteriorating. Third, credit risk in the household sector has increased. Over-supply of credit by large financial institutions in early 2000s had created near crisis in this sector in 2003. The market stabilized rather quickly, but fast increase of residential mortgage loans by commercial banks had triggered new concerns in recent years. Korean financial institutions have in general made remarkable progresses in improving risk management practices. The supervisory authorities (FSC/FSS) had exerted very strong influences on financial institutions to prompt improvements in their risk management functions. As a result, many of the large financial institutions have made noticeable progresses in adopting advanced risk management technologies and risk-based decision making procedures, even medium- and small-sized financial institutions have been rather slow in progress. Due to lack of experience and insufficient dada, however, many financial institutions are still struggling to fully utilize new risk management technologies. Proactive supervisory measures have become ever more important to maintain soundness and safety of the financial system, because most of large financial institutions still pursue similar asset-origination strategies. Early adoption of Basel II and similar risk-based supervisory criteria and strict implementation of Pillar 3 will be essential to maintain stability of the financial markets. Expanding the pool of risk management professionals is also a task that should not be ignored.

1997年金融危机后的十年间，韩国金融市场的风险特征发生了显著变化。首先，1999年至2000年公司债券市场动荡后，大型企业部门的信用风险显著降低。其次，中小型企业（SMEs）部门的信用风险持续恶化。第三，家庭部门的信用风险有所上升。2000年代初大型金融机构的信贷过度供应导致该部门在2003年几近危机。市场虽迅速企稳，但近年来商业银行住房抵押贷款的快速增长引发了新的担忧。韩国金融机构在改进风险管理实践方面总体取得显著进展。监管机构（FSC/FSS）对金融机构施加了强大影响，推动其风险管理职能的改善。因此，许多大型金融机构在采用先进风险管理技术和基于风险的决策流程方面进步明显，而中小型金融机构进展相对缓慢。但由于经验不足和数据缺失，许多机构仍难以充分运用新型风险管理技术。鉴于多数大型金融机构仍采取相似的资产配置策略，采取前瞻性监管措施对维持金融体系稳健与安全愈发重要。尽早实施《巴塞尔协议II》等基于风险的监管标准，严格执行第三支柱要求，对保持金融市场稳定至关重要。扩大风险管理专业人才储备同样是不容忽视的任务。
