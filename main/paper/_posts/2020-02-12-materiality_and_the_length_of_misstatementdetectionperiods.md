In this paper, I examine if misstatement materiality motivates managers to shorten misstatement detection periods. Following the literature, I find that management shortens the gross detection period by about 116 days for material misstatements than for the immaterial misstatements. The impact of materiality is even more evident for the disclosure of serious (fraud/SEC investigated) than non-serious (error-related) misstatements. In order to reduce the confounding factor – SEC 2004 mandates disclosure of material misstatement within four business days – I estimate net detection periods and find consistently that they are negatively associated with materiality. Additional tests using misstatement severity and cumulative income effect in non-BigR firms as alternative measures of materiality yield consistent results. All three tests alleviate the concern that my finding is mechanical due to the regulatory requirement on disclosure. Further test shows that non-earnings related components of materiality contribute to shorter detection periods as well. Finally, I provide evidence that among material-misstating firms the litigation risk is lower for earlier disclosers than for the later. This finding explains why management would like to shorten the detection period of material misstatement.

本文研究了错报重要性是否促使管理层缩短错报发现周期。根据文献分析，我发现管理层对重要错报的总体发现周期比非重要错报缩短约116天。重要性对严重错报（涉及欺诈/美国证监会调查）披露的影响，较非严重错报（与差错相关）更为显著。为减少混杂因素（2004年SEC规定重要错报须在四个工作日内披露），我测算净发现周期后发现其与重要性始终呈负相关。采用错报严重性及非大额调整公司累计收益影响作为重要性替代指标的额外检验，结果保持一致性。三项检验共同缓解了研究结论可能受监管披露要求机械驱动的疑虑。进一步测试表明，重要性中与非盈利相关的构成要素同样会缩短发现周期。最后，我提供的证据显示，在存在重要错报的公司中，较早披露者的诉讼风险低于较晚披露者。这一发现解释了管理层为何愿意缩短重要错报的发现周期。
