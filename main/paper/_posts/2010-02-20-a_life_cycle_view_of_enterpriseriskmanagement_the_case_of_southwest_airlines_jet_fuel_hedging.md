The objective of this paper is to illustrate the life cycle of enterprise risk management using jet fuel price risk management within Southwest Airlines, Inc. Managing market price risk within a corporation appears to follow distinct life cycle periods as a firm moves from creation through a fully mature company. We use the history of SWA to suggest the main life cycle periods.
