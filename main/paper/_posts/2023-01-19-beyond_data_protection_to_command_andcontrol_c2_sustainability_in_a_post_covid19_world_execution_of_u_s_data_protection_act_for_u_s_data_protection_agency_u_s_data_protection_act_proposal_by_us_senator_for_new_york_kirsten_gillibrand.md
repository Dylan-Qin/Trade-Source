The current article about execution of the Data Protection Act (DPA) proposal was sent a week before the State of New York state wide shut-down due to the global COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic to Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, the US Senator from the State of New York who had proposed the DPA. The article underscored the need to advance the focus of its execution beyond ex-post reactive penalization of respective firms for compromise of privacy of personal information by firms 'storing' such data to focus on ex-ante Sustainability and Survival material to individuals. There were two specific issues underlying the above recommendations. First, it is not just about storage of such 'entrusted' data but if and how such data was 'exploited' by the trusted firms to Command & Control the Survival and Sustainability of respective individuals. Second, in most cases, those firms may not even be responsible for such compromise of individual data entrusted to them given that they are themselves subject to being 'hacked' by third parties. Hence, to solve the more critical systemic problem encompassing all individuals and firms, we need to build and stress-test systems to preempt and prevent such 'hacking' attacks in addition to the proposed normative compliance measures. Essentially, for Sustainability and Survival of individual Command & Control (C2), we need to focus on developing and deploying Adversarial C2 systems to stress test the robustness of C2 systems as well as Counter-Adversarial C2 to counter the adversarial threats.The specific focus of global networked systems, infrastructures, and networks that can get impacted in global systemic exponential cascading attacks given the inter-connectivity of networks and often endogenous nature of such attacks was compared with analogous global contagion risks of COVID-19 and their global and national 'spread' that all are monitoring. Over the subsequent few weeks, the COVID-19 global pandemic had unfolded with major adverse impacts evident across public health, global financial and economic, and, global geopolitical, national defense and security, and, related socioeconomic domains. The Survival & Sustainability of Systems at all levels which is at stake and the respective critical significance of Command & Controls - spanning global, national, organizational, individual, and, even human cellular levels of analysis – are being recognized worldwide as never before on the COVID-19 pandemic threats and vulnerabilities "global theater". The respective role of such Command & Controls that are the most essential defining attributes of all Self-Adaptive Systems and their self-identity, self-regulation, and, self-determination are also being recognized in terms of determining the Sustainability and Survival of the respective Systems at all levels. For preempting and preventing future similar global threats such as COVID-19, we need to develop and deploy Adversarial C2 systems to stress test the robustness of C2 for respective Systems as well as Counter-Adversarial C2 to counter the adversarial threats.

当前这篇关于《数据保护法案》(DPA)提案执行情况的文章，是在纽约州因全球COVID-19冠状病毒大流行而全面封锁前一周，发送给提出该法案的纽约州美国参议员柯尔斯滕·吉利布兰德的。文章强调需要将其执行重点从对企业"存储"个人隐私信息泄露的事后反应性惩罚，转向事前关注对个人生存与可持续发展的实质性保障。上述建议基于两个具体问题：首先，这不仅关乎"受托"数据的存储，更在于受信企业是否及如何利用这些数据对个人的生存与可持续发展实施"指挥与控制"；其次，多数情况下这些企业可能无需对受托数据的泄露负责，因为它们自身也面临被第三方"黑客攻击"的风险。因此，为解决涵盖所有个人和企业的系统性关键问题，除既定合规措施外，我们还需构建并压力测试系统以先发制人地预防此类黑客攻击。本质上，为确保个人指挥与控制(C2)的可持续性与生存能力，我们需着力开发部署对抗性C2系统来压力测试C2系统的稳健性，以及反制对抗性威胁的"反对抗C2"系统。鉴于网络互联性及此类攻击常具内生性特征，研究特别聚焦可能遭受全球系统性指数级连锁攻击的全球网络化系统、基础设施与网络，并将其与COVID-19的全球传染风险及各国正在监测的疫情传播态势进行类比。随后数周，COVID-19全球大流行持续蔓延，对公共卫生、全球金融经济、地缘政治、国防安全及相关社会经济领域造成显著负面影响。在这场疫情威胁与脆弱性构成的"全球剧场"中，各层级系统的生存与可持续性所面临的风险，以及指挥与控制机制在全球、国家、组织、个人乃至人类细胞层面的关键作用，正获得前所未有的全球共识。作为所有自适应系统最核心的定义属性，此类指挥与控制机制通过自我识别、自我调节与自主决策决定各层级系统可持续性与生存能力的作用也正被广泛认知。为预防未来类似COVID-19的全球性威胁，我们需开发部署对抗性C2系统以压力测试各系统的C2稳健性，并构建反对抗C2来抵御威胁。我们的全球后AI-量子金融科技指挥与控制网络企业、美国空军研究实验室商业化学院项目、AIMLExchange.com、BRINT.com及C4I-Cyber.com正致力于实现上述全球使命。《保险与金融管理期刊》研究论文预印本：Malhotra, Yogesh，《后疫情时代超越数据保护的指挥与控制(C2)可持续性：美国数据保护局的<数据保护法案>执行》，Journal of Insurance and Financial Management. 第7卷第4期(2023年)66-87页。© Yogesh Malhotra博士版权所有，www.YogeshMalhotra.com。保留所有权利，2022年。www.YogeshMalhotra.com：全球风险管理网络有限责任公司，美国纽约州新哈特福德13413。
