Rapid detection of contaminants for the purpose of sensitive and quantitative monitoring of environmental hazards is an essential first step in realizing the avoidance of human health risks. In this regard, we present a fast and simple electrochemical method of detecting di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) from the river water samples using a phthalic acid group specific aptamer modified on a gold nanoparticle (AuNP) functionalized graphene oxide nano-platelets (GO) and ionic liquid (IL) nanocomposite. Here, the IL/GO nanocomposite provides for an enhanced interaction with the phthalate esters thereby increasing the sensitivity of the sensor surface. The proposed sensor showed a wide linear dynamic range of 0.14 pg/mL to 0.35 ng/mL and 0.35 ng/mL to 7 ng/mL with the detection limit of ≤0.042 pg/mL, which were evaluated using standard, analytical grade DBP; the limit of quantification was determined using different concentrations of DBP in DI water with comparison to GC/MS. The proposed sensor was used to monitor the DBP concentrations in river water samples collected from various locations across South Korea. The quantitative data from the measurements in comparison with standard GC/MS, were then used to ascertain the human health risk posed by the daily consumption of these river waters.

快速检测污染物以实现对环境危害的灵敏定量监测，是规避人类健康风险的关键第一步。为此，我们开发了一种基于邻苯二甲酸基团特异性适配体的电化学方法，该方法利用金纳米颗粒（AuNP）功能化氧化石墨烯纳米片（GO）与离子液体（IL）纳米复合材料，可简便快速地检测河水样本中的邻苯二甲酸二丁酯（DBP）。该IL/GO纳米复合材料能增强与邻苯二甲酸酯类物质的相互作用，从而提升传感器表面的灵敏度。所构建传感器在0.14皮克/毫升至0.35纳克/毫升和0.35纳克/毫升至7纳克/毫升范围内呈现宽线性动态区间，检测限≤0.042皮克/毫升（采用分析级标准DBP评估），定量限则通过对比GC/MS测定不同浓度DBP去离子水溶液确定。应用该传感器对韩国多地采集的河水样本进行DBP浓度监测，并将测量数据与标准GC/MS结果对比，进而评估日常饮用这些河水的潜在健康风险。
