Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to develop a tractable general-equilibrium model, where the market is mixed of large firms (oligopoly) and small firms (monopolistic competition). We will provide new implication of trade gain.Design/Methodology/Approach – Our discussion relies on theoretic analysis for the interaction between large firms and small firms. Large firms compete in quantity-setting (Cournot-competition) so that strategically behave. Large firms are a first-mover while small firms are a second-mover.Findings – When the economy is open, the market-expansion effect induces large firms to reschedule to produce more, and to demand more high-quality workers. The expansion of output-schedules crowds out the production of small firms. The demand of high-quality workers widens wage inequality within country. Small firms lose from trade. However, the more productive workers of small firms gain because large firms offers them jobs. Not all large firms gain. Firms of low-quality workers would lose from trade.Research Implications or Originality – Overall, the effect of trade liberalization on welfare is ambiguous. It depends on distribution of labor qualities and number of large firms. When a country is abundant (scarce) of high-quality laborers, welfare improves (declines). When both countries have the same distribution of labor qualities, welfare improves in the country with a greater number of large firms. This paper can contribute to the literature of granular firms, labor market imperfection, and trade.

目的——本文旨在建立一个易于处理的一般均衡模型，其中市场由大型企业（寡头垄断）和小型企业（垄断竞争）混合组成。我们将提出贸易收益的新解释。. . 设计/方法论/途径——我们的讨论基于大型企业与小型企业相互影响的理论分析。大型企业以数量设定（古诺竞争）方式进行竞争，因而具有战略行为。大型企业作为先动者，小型企业作为后动者。. . 研究发现——当经济开放时，市场扩张效应促使大型企业重新规划增产，并增加对高素质工人的需求。产出计划的扩张挤压了小型企业的生产空间。对高素质工人的需求加剧了国内工资不平等。小型企业在贸易中受损。然而，小型企业中生产率较高的工人因获得大型企业提供的岗位而受益。并非所有大型企业都能获益，低素质工人占比较高的企业将在贸易中受损。. . 研究意义或原创性——总体而言，贸易自由化对福利的影响具有不确定性。这取决于劳动力质量分布和大型企业数量。当一国高技能劳动力充裕（稀缺）时，福利水平将提升（下降）；当两国劳动力质量分布相同时，拥有更多大型企业的国家福利将改善。本研究可为颗粒型企业、劳动力市场不完全性及贸易领域的文献作出贡献。
