Perchlorate is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant worldwide, recognized as an emerging thyroid toxicant. This study focused on the pollution status, spatial distribution, possible sources of perchlorate in raw cow milk collected from 155 dairy farms in China, as well as the health risk of exposure to perchlorate through dairy products.The results showed that the detection rate of perchlorate in raw milk was 100% with the mean of 15.87μg/kg, indicating the ubiquitous contamination of perchlorate in raw milk from China. The simulation of spatial distributions of perchlorate in raw milk indicates high levels of perchlorate exist in certain parts of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, and Zhejiang, suggesting perchlorate contamination might exsit in these regions. The levels of perchlorate in raw milk were positively correlated with perchlorate in cow feed, indicating that perchlorate in raw milk might transfer from cow feed. Therefore, the perchlorate levels in cow feed could be reduced to decrease the perchlorate levels in raw milk in some polluted regions. The hazard quotient (HQ) values of exposure to perchlorate by dairy products ranged from 0-2.136, with the mean of 0.019 and P95 of 0.101, indicating relatively low health risk to perchlorate through dairy products. To our knowledge, this is the first nationwide study on the spatial distribution and risk assessment of perchlorate in raw cow milk from China.

高氯酸盐是一种全球普遍存在的环境污染物，被认定为新兴甲状腺毒素。本研究针对中国155个奶牛场采集的生牛乳中高氯酸盐的污染现状、空间分布、潜在来源及通过乳制品摄入的健康风险展开分析。结果表明生牛乳中高氯酸盐检出率达100%，平均含量为15.87微克/千克，证实我国生牛乳普遍存在高氯酸盐污染。空间分布模拟显示京津冀部分地区、山西、河南及浙江存在高浓度污染区，提示这些区域可能存在高氯酸盐污染源。生牛乳中高氯酸盐含量与奶牛饲料呈正相关，表明污染可能源自饲料传递，因此可通过控制污染区饲料含量降低生牛乳污染水平。乳制品摄入高氯酸盐的危害商值（HQ）范围为0-2.136，均值为0.019，P95值为0.101，显示通过乳制品摄入的健康风险总体较低。据我们所知，这是首个全国范围内生牛乳高氯酸盐空间分布与风险评估研究。
