In this article, we review the literature on the measurement of trade costs in international trade with a special emphasis on nontariff measures and in particular on standards and technical regulations. We distinguish 'direct' from 'indirect' approaches. The direct approach collects observable data or proxy variables on trade cost components which are then typically used as regressors in a gravity equation of trade. Instead, the indirect approach infers the extent of trade impediments from trade flows. It compares actual trade flows to the trade flows predicted by a hypothetical frictionless benchmark scenario based on a micro-founded trade model, attributing the deviation of actual from predicted trade flows to trade frictions. We argue that economists and policymakers can gain useful insights from both approaches.

本文回顾了有关国际贸易中贸易成本测算的文献，特别关注非关税措施，尤其是标准与技术法规。我们区分了"直接"与"间接"两种研究方法。直接法通过收集贸易成本构成要素的可观测数据或代理变量，通常将其作为贸易引力方程中的回归变量；而间接法则从贸易流量反推贸易障碍程度，通过将实际贸易流量与基于微观基础贸易模型构建的无摩擦基准情景下的预测值进行对比，将二者偏差归因于贸易摩擦。我们认为经济学家与政策制定者可从两种方法中获取有益洞见。
