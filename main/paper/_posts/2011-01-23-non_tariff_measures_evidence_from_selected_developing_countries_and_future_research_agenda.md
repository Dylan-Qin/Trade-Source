This publication is one of the first attempts by the United Nations to address in a comprehensive manner the issues relating to NTMs in this age of current global economic turmoil. One of the principal objectives of this report is to stimulate the discussion on NTMs and subsequent impact assessment of the trade strategies on the developing countries market access opportunities, and to contribute to UNCTAD's overarching mission of upholding an open, equitable, rule-based, predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system, as enshrined in the UN Millennium Declaration, as well as to assuring development gains from international trade and trade negotiations. Part I contains the five country reports (Brazil, Chile, India, Thailand and the Philippines). Part II contains a research paper on the methodological approaches to the NTMs quantification. Part III contains the report by the Group of Eminent Persons on Non-Tariff Barriers (GNTB) to the Secretary-General of UNCTAD which was made available at the meeting held on 5 November 2009 in Geneva. The report highlighted the key issues of the UNCTAD initiative in collaboration with international partners in United Nations organizations and agencies, regional organizations and national governments and other partners, and provided policy and technical guidance and recommendations on the implementation of a possible multi-year programme to raise the profile of NTMs activities.

本出版物是联合国在当前全球经济动荡时代首次全面探讨与非关税措施（NTMs）相关问题的尝试之一。报告的主要目标之一是推动关于非关税措施的讨论，评估贸易战略对发展中国家市场准入机会的后续影响，并助力联合国贸易和发展会议（UNCTAD）实现其核心使命——维护《联合国千年宣言》所倡导的开放、公平、基于规则、可预测且非歧视的多边贸易体系，同时确保从国际贸易和贸易谈判中获得发展收益。第一部分包含五个国家报告（巴西、智利、印度、泰国和菲律宾）；第二部分是关于非关税措施量化方法的研究论文；第三部分收录了非关税壁垒问题知名人士小组（GNTB）向UNCTAD秘书长提交的报告，该报告于2009年11月5日在日内瓦举行的会议上发布。报告重点阐述了UNCTAD与联合国系统各组织和机构、区域组织、各国政府及其他合作伙伴共同倡议的关键议题，并就实施可能的多年期计划以提升非关税措施活动能见度提供了政策与技术指导建议。
