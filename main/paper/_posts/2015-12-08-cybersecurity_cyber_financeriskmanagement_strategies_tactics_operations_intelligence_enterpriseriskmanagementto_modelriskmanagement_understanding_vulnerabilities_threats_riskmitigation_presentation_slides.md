The invited plenary keynote presentation addressed to a national group of senior Fortune 100 practice leaders including Chief Security Officers focuses on emerging trends in Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). The keynote builds upon author’s recent Financial Risk Management practice leadership for Wall Street investment banks and recent Cyber Risk Management research conducted with oversight of a committee of distinguished scientists affiliated with Air Force Research Lab, NYS Cyber Research Institute, and State University of New York. The keynote elucidates the Cyber-Finance-Trust TM Framework developed to facilitate applied intuition about how ongoing digitization, virtualization, and transformation of inter- and intra-enterprise networks are contributing to the convergence of Financial Risk Management and Cyber Risk Management. It helps senior executives better understand the emergence of Cyber-Finance Risk Management that is anticipated to subsume most traditional risks generally treated in isolation such as various Financial Risks and Operational Risks. Based on a comprehensive review of most recent Cyber Security and Risk Management trends in two key sectors – Banking & Finance, and, Healthcare –  it facilitates understanding about latest vulnerabilities, threats, and risk assessment and risk mitigation strategies. Advancing beyond computational quantitative analytical risk assessment models found deficient during the global financial crisis, it helps better understand the key role of the ‘human factor’ while relating it to coherent People, Process, and Technology frameworks underlying ERM. To facilitate more precise and accurate Risk Assessment and Risk Modeling for Cyber-Finance Risk Management, the concluding section provides an overview of author’s related research that developed robust foundations for Cyber Risk Insurance (CRI) Modeling. Advancing upon research and practice in CRI Modeling, to help prepare the senior executives responsible for Risk Management and Cybersecurity, the presentation delineates the computational quantitative analytical risk assessment models suitable for catastrophic risks  assessment which are increasingly material to ongoing viability and sustenance of any enterprise.

受邀向包括首席安全官在内的《财富》100强企业资深实践领袖组成的国家团体发表的主旨演讲，聚焦企业风险管理（ERM）的新兴趋势。该演讲基于作者近期为华尔街投行提供的金融风险管理实践领导经验，以及在美国空军研究实验室、纽约州网络安全研究机构和纽约州立大学杰出科学家委员会监督下开展的网络安全风险管理研究。演讲阐述了"网络-金融-信任™框架"的开发成果，该框架旨在帮助人们直观理解企业间及企业内部网络持续数字化、虚拟化和转型如何推动金融风险管理与网络安全风险管理的融合。该框架协助高管更清晰地认识"网络金融风险管理"的兴起——这一新兴领域预计将涵盖多数传统上被孤立处理的风险（如各类金融风险与运营风险）。通过对银行金融业和医疗保健两大关键领域最新网络安全与风险管理趋势的全面梳理，演讲深入剖析了最新漏洞、威胁、风险评估及风险缓释策略。演讲突破全球金融危机中暴露缺陷的计算量化分析风险评估模型局限，通过将"人为因素"与ERM核心的人、流程、技术框架相关联，深化了对此关键要素的理解。为提升网络金融风险管理的评估与建模精度，结尾部分概述了作者为网络风险保险（CRI）建模奠定坚实基础的相关研究。基于CRI建模的研究与实践进展，本演讲为负责风险管理与网络安全的高管量身定制，详细阐释了适用于巨灾风险评估的计算量化分析模型——这类评估对任何企业的持续生存发展正变得日益关键。
