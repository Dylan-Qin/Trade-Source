This article inputs into a research project on the law’s approach to geophysical phenomena of full movement – full movement that is produced by man but which man is unable to control. The concept of full movement beyond control can be illustrated in several domains. The more specific areas of environmental protection and sustainable development highlight two significant examples: the movement of greenhouse gas and the movement of waste.  The hypothesis proposed here is that there exists a silent risk of full movement beyond control. Even as a discernible and potentially measurable phenomenon, the risk of full and beyond control is commonly denied or underestimated. Its treatment is generally based on the illusion that, since it is man who created the movement, he will always have the ability to regain control of it. This flawed approach to the risk explains many of the difficulties encountered in environmental governance matters, particularly in the area of sustainable development and especially when such difficulties motivate the rule of law. Using the idea of silent risk may also be useful for granting full movement beyond control the transversal and inclusive place it warrants.

本文为一项关于法律如何应对完全运动的地球物理现象的研究项目提供了输入。所谓完全运动，指的是由人类引发但人类无法控制的运动。失控的完全运动这一概念可在多个领域中得以阐明。环境保护与可持续发展这两个具体领域尤为突出地体现了两个重要实例：温室气体的运动和废弃物的运动。本文提出的假设是，失控的完全运动存在一种隐性风险。即便作为一种可识别且可能量化的现象，完全且失控的风险通常被否认或低估。对其处理往往基于一种错觉：既然是人类创造了这种运动，人类就始终有能力重新掌控它。这种对风险的错误认知解释了许多环境治理事务中遇到的困难，尤其是在可持续发展领域，特别是当这些困难推动法治进程时。运用隐性风险的概念，或许也有助于赋予失控的完全运动应有的横向包容地位。
