The current article about execution of the Data Protection Act (DPA) proposal was sent a week before the State of New York state wide shut-down due to the global COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic to Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, the US Senator from the State of New York who had proposed the DPA. The article underscored the need to advance the focus of its execution beyond ex-post reactive penalization of respective firms for compromise of privacy of personal information by firms 'storing' such data to focus on ex-ante Sustainability and Survival material to individuals. There were two specific issues underlying the above recommendations. First, it is not just about storage of such 'entrusted' data but if and how such data was 'exploited' by the trusted firms to Command & Control the Survival and Sustainability of respective individuals. Second, in most cases, those firms may not even be responsible for such compromise of individual data entrusted to them given that they are themselves subject to being 'hacked' by third parties. Hence, to solve the more critical systemic problem encompassing all individuals and firms, we need to build and stress-test systems to preempt and prevent such 'hacking' attacks in addition to the proposed normative compliance measures. Essentially, for Sustainability and Survival of individual Command & Control (C2), we need to focus on developing and deploying Adversarial C2 systems to stress test the robustness of C2 systems as well as Counter-Adversarial C2 to counter the adversarial threats.The specific focus of global networked systems, infrastructures, and networks that can get impacted in global systemic exponential cascading attacks given the inter-connectivity of networks and often endogenous nature of such attacks was compared with analogous global contagion risks of COVID-19 and their global and national 'spread' that all are monitoring. Over the subsequent few weeks, the COVID-19 global pandemic had unfolded with major adverse impacts evident across public health, global financial and economic, and, global geopolitical, national defense and security, and, related socioeconomic domains. The Survival & Sustainability of Systems at all levels which is at stake and the respective critical significance of Command & Controls - spanning global, national, organizational, individual, and, even human cellular levels of analysis – are being recognized worldwide as never before on the COVID-19 pandemic threats and vulnerabilities "global theater". The respective role of such Command & Controls that are the most essential defining attributes of all Self-Adaptive Systems and their self-identity, self-regulation, and, self-determination are also being recognized in terms of determining the Sustainability and Survival of the respective Systems at all levels. For preempting and preventing future similar global threats such as COVID-19, we need to develop and deploy Adversarial C2 systems to stress test the robustness of C2 for respective Systems as well as Counter-Adversarial C2 to counter the adversarial threats.

当前这篇关于《数据保护法案》(DPA)提案执行情况的文章，是在纽约州因全球COVID-19冠状病毒大流行而全面封锁前一周，发送给提出该法案的纽约州美国参议员柯尔斯滕·吉利布兰德的。文章强调需要将执行重点从对企业"存储"个人隐私信息泄露的事后反应性惩罚，转向事前关注关乎个人生存与可持续性的实质问题。上述建议基于两个具体问题：其一，核心不仅在于"受托"数据的存储，更在于受信企业是否及如何"利用"这些数据对个人的生存与可持续性实施"指挥与控制"；其二，多数情况下这些企业可能无需对受托数据的泄露负责，因为它们自身也面临第三方"黑客攻击"。因此，要解决这个涉及所有个体与企业的关键系统性难题，我们不仅需要推行规范合规措施，更须构建并压力测试能先发制人阻止此类黑客攻击的体系。本质上，为确保个人指挥与控制(C2)的可持续性与生存能力，我们需重点开发部署对抗性C2系统来压力测试C2系统的稳健性，以及反制对抗性威胁的反向对抗C2系统。文章特别关注了全球网络化系统、基础设施与网络在系统性指数级连锁攻击中的脆弱性——鉴于网络互联性及此类攻击常具内生性特征，这与当前全球密切监控的COVID-19类似传染风险及其国际传播形成类比。随后数周，COVID-19全球大流行迅速显现出对公共卫生、全球金融经济、地缘政治、国防安全及相关社会经济的重大冲击。在这场关乎各层级系统存续的"全球疫情威胁剧场"中，从全球、国家、组织、个体乃至人类细胞层面的指挥与控制关键作用正获得空前认知。作为所有自适应系统最本质特征的这类指挥与控制功能，其通过自我识别、自我调节与自主决策决定各层级系统存续的核心角色也正被广泛认同。为防范未来类似COVID-19的全球性威胁，我们必须开发部署对抗性C2系统来压力测试各系统的C2稳健性，并建立反向对抗C2以抵御威胁。我们全球后AI-量子金融科技指挥与控制网络企业、美国空军研究实验室商业化学院项目、AIMLExchange.com、BRINT.com及C4I-Cyber.com正致力于实现上述全球使命。作者保留提交论文的著作权（详见JIFM版权声明：http://www.journal-of-insurance-and-financial-management.com/index.php/JIFM/about/submissions#copyrightNotice）。《保险与金融管理期刊》研究论文预印本：Malhotra, Yogesh. 《后COVID19时代从数据保护到指挥与控制(C2)可持续性：美国数据保护法案执行与数据保护机构设立》；纽约州美国参议员柯尔斯滕·吉利布兰德提出的美国数据保护法案提案，《保险与金融管理期刊》第7卷第4期(2023年)第66-87页。2022年12月21日提交/2022年12月23日录用/2023年1月16日在线发布：https://journal-of-insurance-and-financial-management.com/index.php/JIFM/issue/view/Journal%20of%20Insurance%20and%20Financial%20Management-Vol.7-Issue.4 。©2022 Yogesh Malhotra博士版权所有，www.YogeshMalhotra.com。保留所有权利。www.YogeshMalhotra.com：全球风险管理网络有限责任公司，美国纽约州新哈特福德13413关键词：风险管理、指挥与控制、对抗性指挥与控制、反向对抗指挥与控制、系统存续、网络安全、疫情、COVID-19、冠状病毒、连锁攻击、数据保护法案JEL分类号：A, C, E, G, P, Z, A1, B23, C00, C01, C02, C4, C5, C6, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C13, C14, C15, C18, C19
