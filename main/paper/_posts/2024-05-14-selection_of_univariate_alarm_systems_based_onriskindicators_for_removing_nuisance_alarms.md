Alarm systems are crucial to the safety and efficiency of industrial processes, but they may be contaminated by massive nuisance alarms. Alarm deadbands and delay timers with their serial and parallel connections are often used to remove nuisance alarms. However, there is still no criterion to determine which one is the most appropriate for a particular process variable from these four alarm systems. This paper proposes a method to select the most suitable alarm system for a process variable, by formulating an indicator to evaluate the risk of missed abnormality detection. The technical challenge of the proposed method is about how to calculate the uncertainty of the risk indicator. The Bayesian estimation approach is utilized to yield the confidence intervals of the risk indicator for addressing the technical challenge. The alarm system with the lowest risk indicator is chosen as the most appropriate one. Numerical and industrial examples are presented to support the proposed method.

报警系统对工业过程的安全与效率至关重要，但它们可能受到大量无效报警的干扰。常采用报警死区和延时器及其串并联组合来消除无效报警。然而，目前仍缺乏标准来确定这四种报警系统中哪一种最适合特定过程变量。本文提出一种方法，通过构建评估异常漏检风险的指标，为过程变量选择最合适的报警系统。该方法的技术挑战在于如何计算风险指标的不确定性。为解决这一难题，采用贝叶斯估计方法得出风险指标的置信区间，最终选择风险指标最低的报警系统作为最优方案。数值案例和工业实例验证了所提方法的有效性。
