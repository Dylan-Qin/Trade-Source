Supply Chain Risk Management has become a key concern for organizations, which is even further emphasized by the current economic and financial crisis. Against this background, this paper investigates successful approaches and experiences by companies in dealing with this new reality, especially as it concerns the supply side. Using in-depth case studies conducted among eight European enterprises, we develop a set of propositions about how enterprises manage supply risks in the financial crises, highlight how their risk management approaches have shifted, and illustrate how they are related to Enterprise Risk Management. Our framework is further differentiated based on whether firms are predominantly engaged in manufacturing or services – a factor influencing how supply chain risk is managed. Transaction cost economics serves as our main theoretical anchor. By rigorously grounding our research in both theory and empirical evidence, we provide valuable insight for both academia and practice.

供应链风险管理已成为企业关注的核心问题，当前经济金融危机进一步凸显其重要性。在此背景下，本文探究了企业应对这一新形势的成功实践与经验，尤其聚焦于供应端管理。通过对八家欧洲企业的深度案例研究，我们提出关于企业在金融危机中管理供应风险的一系列命题，揭示其风险管理模式的转变，并阐明这些实践与企业风险管理的关联性。我们的研究框架还根据企业主要从事制造业或服务业进行了细分——这一因素影响着供应链风险的管理方式。交易成本经济学理论构成我们的主要理论基础。通过将研究严格扎根于理论与实证依据，我们为学术界和实践领域提供了有价值的见解。
