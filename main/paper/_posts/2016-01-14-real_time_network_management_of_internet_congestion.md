The Internet, as is the case with many other networks such as highways and electricity grids, operates under the assumption that capacity will be set to a level such that total peak demand will occasionally exceed capacity. Further, the Internet is designed so that multiple users may dynamically share capacity and multiple services may share the same network links and routers, which is more efficient than offering individual users dedicated capacity or different services using separate links and routers. Every link and router in the various networks that make up the Internet has a limit on its capacity to handle data. The capacity of each link and router in individual networks is determined by the equipment installed by the entity that runs each network in an attempt to optimize performance and cost; the lower the capacity relative to expected demand, the greater the probability that demand upon that link or router at times may exceed its capacity. Significantly, a user’s instantaneous demand for broadband Internet is bursty, meaning that it changes rapidly in time – and when aggregate instantaneous demand exceeds capacity on a network it causes congestion, which can degrade performance. Network operators typically estimate demand months to years in advance, and use such demand estimates to plan a schedule for capacity upgrades. Since it may take months to implement a capacity upgrade, the time scale for managing congestion in this manner is months to years. Thus, although capacity planning can greatly affect how much congestion occurs on a network over time, it cannot react to congestion as it occurs. The impact of congestion upon applications depends on the duration of congestion – which can vary from thousandths of a second up to hours or more – and the nature and design of the application. If the duration of congestion is short enough or the application is tolerant enough of congestion, a user will not notice any degradation in performance. Congestion is thus a problem only when its duration is long enough to be disruptive to applications. Congestion in a network can occur for a wide variety of reasons, some of which can be anticipated and some of which cannot. This report describes how network resources are allocated on a short time scale in order to, among other objectives, manage congestion on the network, and how such congestion management impacts applications and users. Congestion management practices are an important subset of network management practices implemented by a variety of parties or organizations, including Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Application Service Providers (ASPs). Policymakers have expressed great interest in learning what congestion management practices are used in the Internet and how these practices impact users and the broader Internet ecosystem. Furthermore, an understanding of congestion management techniques and practices is crucial in discussions about reasonable network management. One of the key design questions about any congestion management practice concerns the subset of network traffic to which the practice is applied, and its impact upon users and applications. Network operators apply some practices to all traffic on their networks, whereas in other cases practices are applied only to the traffic of specific users or to the traffic associated with specific applications. Application- or user- based congestion management practices may achieve better performance for selected applications. They also may enable service providers to offer connectivity products that cater to particular customer’s tastes or needs. However, they add complexity, which may result in added costs that each network operator will evaluate. In some cases application- or user- based congestion management practices may be harmful to applications. Congestion management practices are composed of generic technical building blocks, described in this report as traffic management “techniques”. This report discusses a range of user- and application- based congestion management techniques, including classification of packets, reservation of resources for particular network flows, storage of content in multiple locations, rate control, routing and traffic engineering, packet dropping, and packet scheduling. Congestion management techniques may be combined to offer a collection of capabilities in various network architectures, and can create services with differentiated performance either within an operator’s network or end-to-end. There are also architecture-specific implementations of congestion management techniques for broadband Internet access over cable, telephone, and cellular networks and for Content Delivery Networks. The offerings of a service provider often include multiple services that may utilize the same network links and routers. While there are benefits and efficiencies to sharing capacity between multiple services, such sharing of capacity also requires the use of congestion management practices. Congestion management “practices” are the uses of particular techniques by particular network operators to avoid, limit, or manage congestion.  This report illustrates a range of congestion management practices that show how providers may combine user- or application- based congestion management techniques, including traffic shaping, prioritization, transcoding, resource reservation, and preferential treatment. The report begins in Sections 1 and 2 by giving an overview of congestion and BITAG’s interest in the issue. Section 3 defines congestion and describes instances in which congestion can occur, the locations in the network where congestion can occur, the indicators of congestion, and the impact congestion can have on applications. In Section 4, the report articulates the differences between congestion management techniques and congestion management practices, and describes the different time scales at which congestion can be seen to occur in the network. This section also describes the parties that implement congestion management practices and on what basis. Although all congestion management is important, in order to limit scope and length Sections 5-7 focus on congestion management techniques and practices that: (1) are implemented or potentially implemented in a network that supports consumer broadband Internet access services; (2) act on a time scale of minutes or less; (3) are used for purposes of congestion management; and (4) are based on user or application. In Section 5, the report focuses on specific congestion management techniques. Section 6 gives specific examples of congestion management practices that are based on user or application. Finally, Section 7 gives the Technical Working Group’s recommendations.

互联网与公路网、电网等其他许多网络一样，其运行机制基于一个前提：容量设定在峰值需求偶尔会超出供给的水平。更高效的设计在于允许多用户动态共享带宽，多服务共用相同网络链路与路由器，而非为单个用户分配专属带宽或为不同服务配置独立链路。构成互联网的每段链路与每台路由器都存在数据处理能力上限，各子网中这些设备的容量由运营方根据性能与成本优化原则配置——容量与预期需求的比值越低，链路或路由器出现过载的概率就越高。值得注意的是，用户对宽带网络的瞬时需求具有突发性，当聚合瞬时需求超过网络容量时就会引发拥塞，导致性能下降。运营商通常需提前数月乃至数年预测需求，据此规划容量升级。由于扩容实施周期可能长达数月，这种拥塞管理的时间尺度为月级至年级。虽然容量规划能显著影响长期拥塞程度，但无法实时应对突发拥塞。拥塞对应用的影响取决于其持续时间（从毫秒级到小时级不等）及应用特性。只有当拥塞持续时间足以干扰应用时才会构成问题。网络拥塞成因复杂，部分可预见而部分不可控。本报告阐述网络资源在微观时间尺度上的分配机制（包括拥塞管理方法）及其对应用与用户的影响。拥塞管理实践是网络管理体系的重要组成，由互联网服务提供商（ISP）和应用服务提供商（ASP）等主体实施。政策制定者高度关注互联网拥塞管理实践及其对用户和生态的影响，理解这些技术对讨论合理网络管理至关重要。任何拥塞管理方案的核心设计问题都涉及作用对象（特定流量/用户/应用）及其影响。全域流量管理方案与定向管理方案各有优劣：后者可为特定应用优化性能，或满足个性化服务需求，但会增加复杂度与成本，甚至可能损害其他应用。拥塞管理实践由通用技术模块构成，本报告称之为"流量管理技术"，包括数据包分类、流量资源预留、内容分布式存储、速率控制、路由与流量工程、丢包策略及分组调度等。这些技术可通过不同组合形成差异化服务能力，在有线、电话、蜂窝网络及内容分发网络（CDN）中各有特定实现。服务商常将多业务部署于相同网络设备，共享容量虽提升效率，但也依赖拥塞管理。"拥塞管理实践"特指运营商运用具体技术应对拥塞的操作方法。本报告通过流量整形、优先级划分、转码、资源预留及优待策略等案例，展示用户/应用导向的实践组合。报告结构如下：第1-2章概述拥塞问题及BITAG的关注背景；第3章明确定义，分析拥塞发生场景、位置、表征及对应用的影响；第4章区分技术与实践，阐述不同时间尺度下的拥塞表现及实施主体；为聚焦研究范围，第5-7章重点讨论符合以下特征的案例：(1)应用于消费者宽带接入网络；(2)作用于分钟级以下时间尺度；(3)以拥塞管理为目的；(4)基于用户或应用属性。第5章详解具体技术，第6章提供定向管理实践案例，第7章陈述技术工作组建议。
