In this paper, we simulate and analyze the impact of financial regulations concerning the collateralization of derivative trades on systemic risk - a topic that has been vigorously discussed since the financial crisis in 2007/08. Experts often disagree on the efficacy of these regulations. Compounding this problem banks regard their trade data required for a full analysis as proprietary. We adapt a simulation technology combining advances in graph theory to randomly generate entire financial systems sampled from realistic distributions with a novel open source risk engine to compute risks in financial systems under different regulations. This allows us to consistently evaluate, predict and optimize the impact of financial regulations on all levels - from a single trade to systemic risk - before it is implemented. The resulting data set is accessible to contemporary data science techniques like data mining, anomaly detection and visualization. We find that collateralization reduces the costs of resolving a financial system in crisis, yet it does not change the distribution of those costs and can have adverse effects on individual participants in extreme situations.

本文模拟并分析了衍生品交易抵押相关金融监管对系统性风险的影响——这一议题自2007/08年金融危机以来一直备受热议。专家们对这些监管措施的有效性常有分歧，而银行又将全面分析所需的交易数据视为商业机密，使得问题更为复杂。我们采用结合图论进展的模拟技术，从现实分布中随机生成完整金融体系样本，并运用新型开源风险引擎计算不同监管下金融体系的风险。这种方法使我们能在政策实施前，从单笔交易到系统性风险的各个层面，持续评估、预测和优化金融监管的影响。生成的数据集适用于当代数据科学技术，如数据挖掘、异常检测和可视化。研究发现，抵押品制度虽能降低危机中金融体系的处置成本，但不会改变这些成本的分布，且在极端情况下可能对个别参与者产生不利影响。
