This study investigates the risk mitigation and internal control processes organizations implement in their Robotic Process Automation (RPA) deployments in accounting. The roles of internal controls and risk mitigation are examined by exploring how RPA Program Managers have adopted internal controls and risk mitigation regarding RPA in accounting. Employing interviews with 20 RPA Program Managers, this study provides rich insights into RPA Governance for accounting processes. The interviews revealed that organizations adopt various governance models to ensure proper oversight over RPA in accounting. RPA Governance models range from being fully centralized to being entirely decentralized. RPA risk and control oversight includes unique risk assessments for the RPA accounting environment

本研究探讨了组织在会计领域机器人流程自动化（RPA）部署中实施的风险缓释与内部控制流程。通过调研RPA项目经理如何在会计RPA应用中采用内部控制与风险缓释措施，深入剖析了这两者在其中的作用。基于对20位RPA项目经理的深度访谈，本研究为会计流程的RPA治理提供了丰富洞见。访谈显示，各组织采用多样化治理模式以确保对会计RPA的恰当监督，其治理框架呈现从完全集中式到完全分散式的光谱分布。针对RPA会计环境的特殊风险评估，构成了RPA风险与控制监督体系的重要组成部分。
