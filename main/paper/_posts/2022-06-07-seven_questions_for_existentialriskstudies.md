Recent years have seen the emergence of Existential Risk Studies (ERS), a rich field focused on understanding and mitigating a range of Extreme Technological Risks. This interdisciplinary and idiosyncratic field today finds itself at a crossroads: at the same time as many risks are growing increasingly urgent, there is increasing attention and potential to shape global action in response. The magnitude of both risks and opportunities create an urgent need for this field to reflect on how it defines itself going forward–as a community, as a science, and as a project pursuing change.Drawing on work from across the ERS field and beyond, as well as the authors' personal experiences, this article seeks to spur and aid this process of reflection. To that end, we pose and discuss seven key questions for the ERS field. These are: (1) how can scholars of ERS choose which risks to prioritize? (2) How or why can we prioritize extreme technological risk over other global problems, and what are the possible downsides of ERS? (3) What are the different possible approaches to studying and managing ETRs? (4) In what ways can the field of ERS pursue a coherent scientific approach? (5) How can or should ERS pursue impact to mitigate ETRs? (6) How diverse is the field of ERS, and how can greater diversity aid the ERS field? (7) How can ERS best reflect on -and communicate about these questions, as it continues to grow?We do not provide definitive answers, but attempt to explore how and why different people might respond in different ways. We point to open debates around: disciplinary direction, pluralism, epistemic modesty, diversity, inclusion, representation and accountability. We take these challenges to be not just important but increasingly urgent, as pivotal considerations in charting a path forward for our field–and, perhaps, our world.

近年来，生存风险研究（ERS）这一新兴领域逐渐兴起，它致力于理解和缓解一系列极端技术风险，成为一个内涵丰富的学科。这个跨学科且独具特色的领域如今正处在十字路口：一方面许多风险日益紧迫，另一方面全球应对行动的关注度与塑造潜力也在提升。风险与机遇的双重重要性迫切要求该领域从社群构成、科学定位到变革实践等维度重新审视自身发展方向。本文结合ERS领域内外研究成果及作者个人经验，旨在推动并辅助这一反思进程。为此我们提出并探讨了ERS领域的七个核心问题：（1）学者如何选择优先研究的风险类型？（2）为何应将极端技术风险置于其他全球问题之上？ERS可能存在哪些弊端？（3）研究与管理极端技术风险有哪些不同路径？（4）ERS领域如何建立连贯的科学方法论？（5）ERS应通过何种方式实现风险缓解的影响力？（6）该领域多样性现状如何？提升多样性有何裨益？（7）随着领域发展，ERS应如何有效反思并传播这些问题的探讨？. . 我们并未提供确定性答案，而是试图探究不同群体可能作出差异化回应的原因及方式。文中指出了若干开放性争议：学科方向、多元主义、认知谦逊、多样性、包容性、代表性与问责制。我们认为这些挑战不仅至关重要且日益紧迫，它们或将决定本领域——甚或整个人类社会——的未来发展轨迹。
