A core prediction of recent "dual-self" models is that a person's risk attitudes depend on her current level of self-control. While these models have received a lot of attention, empirical studies tailored to testing their core prediction are lacking. Using two prominent models, we derive precise hypotheses for choices between risky monetary payoffs in a state of low self-control, compared to regular self-control; in particular, lower levels of self-control should induce stronger risk aversion for stakes within a particular range.We test the hypotheses in a lab experiment with a large number of subjects (N = 308), using a well-established self-control depletion task and measuring risk attitudes via finely graduated choice lists. While independent manipulation checks document the effectiveness of our depletion task, we do not find any evidence for increased risk aversion after self-control depletion. Our findings have important implications for the future modeling of decision making under risk.

近期“双重自我”模型的一个核心预测是，个人的风险态度取决于其当下的自我控制水平。尽管这些模型备受关注，但专门检验其核心预测的实证研究仍属匮乏。基于两个经典模型，我们推导出关于低自控状态与常态自控状态下风险货币收益选择的精确假设：特定金额范围内，自我控制水平降低应导致更强的风险规避倾向。我们通过实验室实验（样本量N=308）检验这些假设，采用成熟的自控损耗任务并通过精细分级的选择列表测量风险态度。虽然独立操纵检验证实了损耗任务的有效性，但我们未发现自控损耗后风险规避增强的任何证据。本研究发现对风险决策的未来建模具有重要启示。
