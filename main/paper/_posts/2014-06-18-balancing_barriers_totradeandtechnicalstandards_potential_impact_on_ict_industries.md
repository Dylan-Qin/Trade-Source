This paper investigates the connection between technical standards, ICT industries, and international trade law to demonstrate how standards can be used as potential barriers to trade. There has been less attention paid to the role of standards as a form of protectionism, despite the introduction of Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (‘TBT Agreement’) on 15 April 1994. Stated as an objective, the TBT Agreement is to ensure that no unnecessary obstacles to international trade are created. While governments in the past have relied upon high tariffs and quotas imposed on imports to protect local industries or discriminate against foreign-produced goods, less transparent measures – referred to as non-tariff barriers – are now becoming more prominent. On one hand, it signals the growing significance of proprietary technologies in standards, demonstrating that public policy must embrace these concerns, but on the other hand, the continued tensions between two significant trading partners – China and the United States – demonstrates the complexity of international trade law in this area.

本文探讨技术标准、信息通信技术产业与国际贸易法之间的联系，以论证标准如何可能成为贸易壁垒。尽管《技术性贸易壁垒协定》（简称《TBT协定》）已于1994年4月15日生效，但标准作为保护主义手段的作用仍未受到足够重视。《TBT协定》旨在确保不构成对国际贸易不必要的障碍。过去政府依赖高关税和进口配额来保护本土产业或歧视外国产品，如今更不透明的非关税壁垒措施正日益凸显。一方面，这显示专有技术在标准中的重要性日益提升，表明公共政策必须关注这些问题；另一方面，中美两大贸易伙伴间持续紧张的关系，也凸显了该领域国际贸易法的复杂性。
