Integrated assessment is an analysis of a topic that integrates multiple lines of research. Integrated assessments are thus inherently interdisciplinary. They are generally oriented toward practical problems, often in the context of public policy, and frequently concern topics in science and technology. This paper presents a concept for and some initial work towards an integrated assessment of global catastrophic risk (GCR). Generally speaking, GCR is the risk of significant harm to global human civilization. More precise definitions are provided below. Some GCRs include nuclear war, climate change, and pandemic disease outbreaks. Integrated assessment of GCR puts all these risks into one study in order to address overarching questions about the risk and the opportunities to reduce it. The specific concept for integrated assessment presented here has been developed over several years by the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute (GCRI). GCRI is an independent, nonprofit think tank founded in 2011 by Seth Baum and Tony Barrett (i.e., the authors). The integrated assessment structures much of GCRI’s thinking and activity, and likewise offers a framework for general study and work on the GCR topic.

综合评估是对某一主题整合多方研究线索的分析。因此，综合评估本质上是跨学科的。这类评估通常以实际问题为导向，常涉及公共政策领域，并频繁关注科技议题。本文提出了针对全球灾难性风险（GCR）进行综合评估的构想及初步研究。广义而言，GCR指对全球人类文明造成重大伤害的风险，下文将提供更精准的定义。此类风险包括核战争、气候变化和大规模流行病爆发等。GCR综合评估将这些风险纳入统一研究框架，以解决关于风险本质及减灾机遇的核心问题。本文阐述的综合评估具体构想由全球灾难性风险研究所（GCRI）历经数年研发而成。GCRI是由塞斯·鲍姆与托尼·巴雷特（即本文作者）于2011年创立的独立非营利智库。该综合评估体系构成了GCRI大部分思想与行动的基础，同时也为GCR主题的普遍研究与实践提供了框架。
