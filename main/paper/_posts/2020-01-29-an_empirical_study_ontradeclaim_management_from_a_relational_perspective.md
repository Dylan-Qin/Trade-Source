Purpose – This study is designed to provide new insights on trade claim management by typifying trade claims from a relational perspective, which defines trade as an organic combination that exchanges relationships based on a mutual goal instead of conflicts between obligations and rights of the contracting parties.Design/methodology – This is a phenomenological study that aims to typify trade claims based on a relational perspective and extract implications for trade claim management. The research procedures of this study are as follows. First, international commercial dispute cases applying the CISG are collected. Second, the cases collected are quantified through content analysis. The variables for quantification are developed based on a relationship perspective. Third, cluster analysis is conducted on coded data to typify cases. And finally, this study compares the characteristics of each type using analysis of variance and suggests implications for the strategic management of trade claims from a relational perspective.Findings – Results show that trade claims are divided into four clusters, depending on whether flexibility is accepted or not and which party violates mutuality. There is also a difference between the claimant and the cause of the claim, according to the cluster. Based on the results, this study suggests that the buyer and the seller should employ different strategies depending on the type of trade claim and presents proposals for strategic claim management.Originality/value – Firstly, this study extends the theoretical discussion on trade claims by applying relational contract theory. Prior studies on trade claims have been primarily based on traditional contract theory. The second is to analyze trade claims quantitatively. Prior case studies on trade claims have mainly relied on qualitative research. Finally, the study contributes to international commercial practice by typifying trade claims and presenting options for strategic management.

目的——本研究旨在通过从关系视角对贸易索赔进行分类，为贸易索赔管理提供新的见解。该视角将贸易定义为基于共同目标交换关系的有机组合，而非合同双方权利义务的冲突。  . 设计/方法——这是一项现象学研究，旨在基于关系视角对贸易索赔进行分类，并提炼对贸易索赔管理的启示。研究步骤如下：首先，收集适用《联合国国际货物销售合同公约》（CISG）的国际商业纠纷案例；其次，通过内容分析法对案例进行量化，量化变量基于关系视角开发；第三，对编码数据进行聚类分析以分类案例；最后，通过方差分析比较各类别的特征，并从关系视角提出贸易索赔战略管理的启示。  . 研究发现——结果显示，根据是否接受灵活性以及哪一方违反互惠性，贸易索赔可分为四类。不同类别的索赔方和索赔原因也存在差异。基于此，本研究建议买卖双方应根据贸易索赔类型采取不同策略，并提出战略性索赔管理的方案。  . 原创性/价值——首先，本研究通过应用关系契约理论拓展了贸易索赔的理论讨论。先前研究主要基于传统契约理论；其次，采用定量方法分析贸易索赔，而既往案例研究多依赖定性分析；最后，通过分类贸易索赔并提出战略管理选项，为国际商业实践提供了参考。
