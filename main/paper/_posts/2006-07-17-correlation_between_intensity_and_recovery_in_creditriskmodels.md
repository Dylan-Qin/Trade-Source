There has been increasing support in the empirical literature that both the probability of default (PD) and the loss given default (LGD) are correlated and driven by macroeconomic variables. Paradoxically, there has been very little effort from the theoretical literature to develop credit risk models that would include this possibility. The goals of this paper are: first, to develop the theoretical reduced-form framework needed to handle stochastic correlation of recovery and intensity, proposing a new class of models; second, to understand under what conditions would our class of models reflect empirically observed features and, finally, to use concrete model from our class to study the impact of this correlation in credit risk term structures.  We show that, in our class of models, it is possible to model directly empirically observed features. For instance, we can define default intensity and losses given default to be higher during economic depression periods - the well-know credit risk business cycle effect. Using the concrete model we show that in reduced-form models different assumptions - concerning default intensities, distribution of losses given default, and specifically their correlation - have a significant impact on the shape of credit spread term structures, and consequently on pricing of credit products as well as credit risk assessment in general. Finally, we propose a way to calibrate this class of models to market data, and illustrate the technique using our concrete example using US market data on corporate yields.

实证文献中越来越多的证据表明，违约概率（PD）与违约损失率（LGD）存在相关性，且两者均受宏观经济变量驱动。然而矛盾的是，理论文献却鲜少尝试构建包含这种可能性的信用风险模型。本文目标有三：首先，建立处理回收率与违约强度随机相关性的理论简化形式框架，提出新模型类别；其次，探究该模型类在何种条件下能反映实证观察到的特征；最后，通过具体模型研究这种相关性对信用风险期限结构的影响。我们证明，该模型类可直接刻画实证观察到的特征。例如，能定义经济萧条时期更高的违约强度与违约损失率——即众所周知的信用风险经济周期效应。通过具体模型展示：在简化形式模型中，关于违约强度、违约损失率分布及其相关性的不同假设，会显著影响信用利差期限结构的形态，进而影响信用产品定价及整体信用风险评估。最后，我们提出基于市场数据校准此类模型的方法，并运用美国公司债券收益率市场数据进行实例演示。
