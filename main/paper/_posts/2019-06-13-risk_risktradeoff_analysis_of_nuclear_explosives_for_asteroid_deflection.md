To prevent catastrophic asteroid-Earth collisions, it has been proposed to use nuclear explosives to deflect away Earthbound asteroids. However, this policy of nuclear deflection could inadvertently increase the risk of nuclear war and other violent conflict. This article conducts risk-risk tradeoff analysis to assess whether nuclear deflection results in a net increase or decrease in risk. Assuming nonnuclear deflection options are also used, nuclear deflection may only be needed for the largest and most imminent asteroid collisions. These are low-frequency, high-severity events. The effect of nuclear deflection on violent conflict risk is more ambiguous due to the complex and dynamic social factors at play. Indeed, it is not clear whether nuclear deflection would cause a net increase or decrease in violent conflict risk. Similarly, this article cannot reach a precise conclusion on the overall risk-risk tradeoff. The value of this article comes less from specific quantitative conclusions and more from providing an analytical framework and a better overall understanding of the policy decision. The article demonstrates the importance of integrated analysis of global risks and the policies to address them, as well as the challenge of quantitative evaluation of complex social processes such as violent conflict.

为防止灾难性小行星撞击地球，有人提议使用核爆炸装置使近地小行星偏离轨道。然而这种核偏转策略可能无意中增加核战争及其他暴力冲突的风险。本文通过风险权衡分析来评估核偏转技术究竟会带来净风险增加还是降低。假设同时采用非核偏转方案，核偏转技术可能仅需用于应对最巨大且最迫在眉睫的小行星撞击——这类事件具有低频高损特性。由于涉及复杂多变的社会因素，核偏转对暴力冲突风险的影响更为模糊，目前尚无法明确其会带来暴力冲突风险的净增加还是降低。同样，本文对整体风险权衡也无法得出精确结论。本文的价值更多在于提供分析框架和提升政策决策的全局认知，而非具体量化结论。研究揭示了全球风险及其应对政策进行综合分析的重要性，同时也展现了暴力冲突等复杂社会过程量化评估的挑战性。
