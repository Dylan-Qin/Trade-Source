Intra-industry-trade (IIT) demonstrates the degrees of integration of an economy with the world and the status of that economy within the global value chain. This paper compared the IIT data of Korea and selected MENA countries. The Grubel and Lloyd index was calculated using the COMTRADE data during the period of 1995-2015 to compare the dynamics of IIT flows under each free trade agreement (FTA) regime. IIT flows did not show much change in patterns in the case of Algeria and Saudi- Arabia. In particular, it was found that the FTA of Algeria with the EU did not affect the trade structure. The comparative advantage of Algeria and Saudi-Arabia remains in their primary commodities reflecting a narrow industrial base. But the IIT flows of Turkey exhibited that Turkey had been integrating into the global value chain system after its FTA with the EU. These results are in accordance with the findings of Bülhart (2008) indicating that the positive association between IIT and income is not universal. As for Korea, its IIT flows shows that the Korea economy has become deeply integrated with the EU and the USA following its FTA. Overall, the IIT flows have been advancing to a high level of trade structure.

行业内贸易（IIT）反映了一个经济体与世界经济的融合程度及其在全球价值链中的地位。本文比较了韩国与部分中东和北非国家的行业内贸易数据，采用Grubel和Lloyd指数测算1995-2015年期间COMTRADE数据库的贸易动态，对比不同自由贸易协定（FTA）框架下的行业内贸易变化趋势。阿尔及利亚和沙特阿拉伯的行业内贸易模式未呈现显著变化，特别是阿尔及利亚与欧盟的自由贸易协定未对其贸易结构产生影响。两国仍保持初级产品的比较优势，反映出其狭窄的工业基础。而土耳其的行业内贸易数据表明，该国在与欧盟签订自贸协定后正逐步融入全球价值链体系。这些发现与Bülhart（2008）的研究结论相符，证实行业内贸易与收入水平之间的正向关联并不具有普遍性。就韩国而言，其行业内贸易数据显示，在签订自贸协定后，韩国经济已深度融入欧盟和美国市场。总体而言，韩国的行业内贸易正朝着更高层次的贸易结构演进。
