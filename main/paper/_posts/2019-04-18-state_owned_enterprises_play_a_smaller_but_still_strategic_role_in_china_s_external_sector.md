China’s external sector has been the engine behind the country’s robust economic growth over the past four decades. By 2016, China’s total merchandise trade accounted for 16.1% of the world total, compared to 0.6% in 1978 when its economic reforms were initiated. China’s rapid trade growth was attributable to a series of interrelated factors. This briefing focuses on one of those factors—China’s declining dependence on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in much, but not all, of its trade activity. Using the latest data, and starting from 1995 when official trade statistics became more reliable, this briefing (a) describes SOEs’ declining influence in China’s trade and (b) highlights prominent sectoral exceptions where Chinese SOEs still affect global market conditions.

中国的外贸部门是过去四十年里推动其经济强劲增长的主要动力。截至2016年，中国商品贸易总额占全球总量的16.1%，而在1978年经济改革启动之初，这一比例仅为0.6%。中国贸易的快速增长得益于一系列相互关联的因素。本简报重点探讨其中一个因素——中国在大部分（但非全部）贸易活动中对国有企业的依赖度逐步下降。基于自1995年官方贸易统计数据更为可靠以来的最新数据，本简报（1）阐述了国有企业在对外贸易中影响力的减弱；（2）着重分析了中国国企仍对全球市场产生显著影响的重点行业例外情况。
