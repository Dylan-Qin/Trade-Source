The weave of global free market concept is near to death now.  Hope for the free market trade was initiated by the World Trade Center (WTO) under its inspiring agreements as a part of multilateral trade negotiations. Several rounds of WTO showed light for free movement of goods, services even manpower from least developing countries to the developed markets. WTO was successful to negotiate a long list of agreements like Agreement on Agriculture, Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, Agreement on Trade Related Investment Measures, Agreement on Anti-Dumping, Agreement on Customs Valuation, Agreement on Pre-shipment Inspection, Agreement on Rules of Origin, Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures, Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, Agreement on Safeguards, General Agreement on Trade in Services, Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, Agreement on Government Procurement, and Trade Facilitation Agreement etc. within last three decades. But major challenge bring forward while the agreements started to be enforce in practice. First attract was led by USA who refuses to implement DFQFMA to the LDCs and introduced a condition of 97% products, they had selected these 97% so list of products so comprehensively for the countries that all major export items of the LDC countries like Bangladesh went out of 97%. Various counter proposals were placed and standard, compliance and conditions etc. forms of restrictions made the negotiation complex and time consuming.

全球自由贸易理念的构架如今已濒临消亡。对自由贸易的希望最初由世界贸易组织（WTO）通过其鼓舞人心的协议所发起，作为多边贸易谈判的一部分。WTO的数轮谈判为商品、服务乃至最不发达国家向发达市场的人力自由流动带来了曙光。过去三十年间，WTO成功协商了一系列重要协议，包括《农业协定》《实施卫生与植物卫生措施协定》《技术性贸易壁垒协定》《与贸易有关的投资措施协定》《反倾销协定》《海关估价协定》《装运前检验协定》《原产地规则协定》《进口许可程序协定》《补贴与反补贴措施协定》《保障措施协定》《服务贸易总协定》《与贸易有关的知识产权协定》《政府采购协定》以及《贸易便利化协定》等。然而当这些协议进入实际执行阶段时，重大挑战随之显现。首当其冲的是美国拒绝向最不发达国家实施免关税免配额市场准入（DFQFMA），反而提出97%产品的限定条件——其精心设计的97%产品清单将孟加拉国等最不发达国家的主要出口商品全部排除在外。各国提出的各类反提案，以及以标准、合规和条件等形式出现的限制措施，使得谈判变得异常复杂且耗时。
