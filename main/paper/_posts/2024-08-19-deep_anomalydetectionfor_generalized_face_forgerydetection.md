Nowadays, the face forgery causes great threat to societal security, hence it is of paramount importance to develop effective countermeasures against it. Though most existing methods adopt neural networks to automatically extract discriminative features for forgery detection and have achieved good results, there are still unignorable problems. Namely, when detecting forgery faces generated by unknown forgery methods, the detection performance de- creases seriously, which means the generalization capability is poor. To com- pensate for such limitations, a novel deep anomaly detection for generalized face forgery detection (DAGFD) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the artifact map generator optimized by triplet focal loss and metric-softmax loss is first used to locate the fake regions and amplify the semantic features of the forgery videos. Next, forgery detection is reformulated from the anomaly de- tection perspective, and the artifact map score is calculated to detect forgery videos. Furthermore, mean square error (MSE) loss is used to minimize the artifact map score of real samples while increase the one of forgery samples to generalize well to unseen forgery methods. Also, circle loss is used for auxiliary classifier to learn more discriminative artifact features. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method’s detection accuracy is better than other state-of-the-art methods.

如今，人脸伪造对社会安全构成重大威胁，因此开发有效的应对措施至关重要。尽管现有方法大多采用神经网络自动提取区分性特征进行伪造检测并取得良好效果，但仍存在不可忽视的问题。具体表现为：当检测未知伪造方法生成的假脸时，检测性能显著下降，表明其泛化能力不足。为弥补这一缺陷，本文提出了一种基于深度异常检测的广义人脸伪造检测新方法（DAGFD）。该方法首先通过三重焦点损失和度量-softmax损失优化的伪影图生成器定位伪造区域，放大伪造视频的语义特征；随后从异常检测角度重构伪造检测任务，通过计算伪影图得分实现伪造视频识别；进一步采用均方误差（MSE）损失最小化真实样本的伪影图得分，同时提升伪造样本得分，从而增强对未知伪造方法的泛化能力；此外引入圆形损失辅助分类器学习更具判别力的伪影特征。实验结果表明，所提方法的检测精度优于其他最先进方法。
