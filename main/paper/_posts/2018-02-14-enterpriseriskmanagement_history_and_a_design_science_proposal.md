Purpose − This paper investigates the evolution of enterprise risk management (ERM) out of fragmented disciplinary perspectives to provide a foundation for promoting interdisciplinary research and proposes a design science approach for more effective ERM implementation in organizations. Design/methodology/approach − This conceptual paper synthesizes ERM research and practice from multiple disciplines. Findings − Corporate risk management concepts were born in academic finance and developed further in the finance subset known as risk management and insurance. With the advent of ERM, efforts must broaden beyond applying statistical models to quantifiable risks. Other disciplines have expanded ERM research by embracing techniques to investigate risk management practices to produce knowledge that integrates practice and theory. ERM is promoted as integrated risk management, yet silos still remain in both practice and research. Originality/value − Provides a foundation and a proposal for moving ERM past academic and organizational silos, which is necessary to achieve the ERM philosophy and increase organizational resilience. Understanding the evolution and fragmented nature of ERM research and practice provides a foundation for interdisciplinary cooperation necessary to achieve the holistic ERM philosophy. A next frontier is effective ERM implementation. This paper argues for an organizational design science approach for mitigating the resistance to change that confounds effective implementation of ERM in organizations facing an increasingly uncertain environment and outlines future research for applying the approach to implementing the ISO 31000 risk management process.

目的——本文探讨了企业风险管理（ERM）如何从分散的学科视角中演变而来，为促进跨学科研究奠定基础，并提出一种设计科学方法以更有效地在组织中实施ERM。  . 设计/方法论/途径——本概念性论文综合了多学科领域的ERM研究与实务。  . 研究结果——企业风险管理概念起源于学术金融领域，并在金融学的风险管理与保险分支中进一步发展。随着ERM的出现，相关研究必须超越对可量化风险应用统计模型的范畴。其他学科通过采用调查风险管理实践的技术扩展了ERM研究，从而产生了整合实践与理论的知识体系。尽管ERM被倡导为整合性风险管理，但在实践和研究中仍存在壁垒。  . 原创性/价值——为突破ERM在学术界和组织中的壁垒提供了基础与方案，这对实现ERM理念和增强组织韧性至关重要。理解ERM研究与实践的演变过程及碎片化特征，为实现整体性ERM理念所需的跨学科合作奠定了基础。有效实施ERM是下一个前沿领域。本文主张采用组织设计科学方法来缓解变革阻力——这种阻力困扰着在日益不确定环境中实施ERM的组织，并概述了未来应用该方法实施ISO 31000风险管理流程的研究方向。
