Although Vietnam has been an official member of WTO since 2007, non-tariff measures such as Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) measures in WTO agreements are not familiar to many corporate or governmental entities. Therefore, TBT and SPS measures are not consistently implemented and the advantages of such agreements are not realized. It was determined that international policy learning, searching international experience for transferable ‘best practice’ and identifying common trends and pressures that affect other systems, would be an avenue toward amending domestic policy to facilitate compliance with TBT and SPS agreements.Given that the plastics and agricultural industries are fast emerging markets of particular importance to Vietnam’s economy, they were chosen as the focus of our study. Two other Southeast Asian countries, Malaysia and Thailand were selected for our policy learning study. Historical to date trade data with country specific policy development trends and strategies were collected and processed. Local experts in Malaysia, Thailand and WTO were consulted. It was discovered that the plastics industry is not an industry with a long history of development in Malaysia but which is one of the most important export products of Malaysia. Thailand is a leading agricultural products exporter even to markets which set up strict TBT and/or SPS measures. Export value, product structure and export market structure were all analyzed. Results suggest that the achievements of Malaysia and Thailand area attributable to well-engineered Government policy, as well as corporate compliance with TBT and SPS measures in both countries. In order to determine how the products of this study might reasonably inform domestic policy and industry practice a better knowledge of the current state of the industries with regard to implementation of TBT and SPS measures was required. Questionnaires were submitted to traders, producers and industry associations in Vietnam to document SPS and TBT agreements compliance practices. Results of the questionnaire illustrate how and to what extent lessons garnered from the policy learning study can be successfully employed in Vietnam.

尽管越南自2007年已成为世贸组织正式成员，但许多企业或政府机构对WTO协议中的技术性贸易壁垒（TBT）和卫生与植物检疫措施（SPS）仍不熟悉。因此，TBT和SPS措施未能得到连贯实施，相关协议的优势也未能充分体现。研究表明，通过国际政策学习、借鉴可移植的"最佳实践"国际经验，并识别影响其他体系的共同趋势与压力，可作为修订国内政策以促进TBT和SPS协议合规的有效途径。鉴于塑料和农业是越南经济中快速崛起的重要产业，本研究选定这两个领域作为重点。我们选取马来西亚和泰国这两个东南亚国家进行政策学习研究，收集并处理了历史贸易数据及各国政策发展趋势与战略，同时咨询了马来西亚、泰国及WTO的本地专家。研究发现：塑料产业虽非马来西亚的传统支柱产业，却已成为该国最重要的出口产品之一；泰国则是农产品出口强国，其产品甚至能进入设立严格TBT/SPS措施的市场。通过分析出口价值、产品结构和出口市场结构，结果显示马泰两国的成就源于政府精心设计的政策及企业对TBT/SPS措施的合规实践。为评估本研究结果对越南国内政策与行业实践的指导价值，需深入了解当前产业执行TBT/SPS措施的现状。我们向越南贸易商、生产商及行业协会发放问卷，记录其SPS/TBT协议合规实践。问卷结果揭示了政策学习经验在越南应用的可行性及实施路径。
