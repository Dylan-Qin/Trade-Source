La version française de ce document est disponible àhttp://ssrn.com/abstract=2198583The study of risk management began after World War II. Risk management has long been associated with the use of market insurance to protect individuals and companies from various losses associated with accidents. Other forms of risk management, alternatives to market insurance, surfaced during the 1950s when market insurance was perceived as very costly and incomplete for protection against pure risk. The use of derivatives as risk management instruments arose during the 1970s, and expanded rapidly during the 1980s, as companies intensified their financial risk management. International risk regulation began in the 1980s, and financial firms developed internal risk management models and capital calculation formulas to hedge against unanticipated risks and reduce regulatory capital. Concomitantly, governance of risk management became essential, integrated risk management was introduced and the chief risk officer positions were created. Nonetheless, these regulations, governance rules and risk management methods failed to prevent the financial crisis that began in 2007.

该文件的法文版本可在http://ssrn.com/abstract=2198583获取。风险管理研究始于第二次世界大战后。长期以来，风险管理一直与利用市场保险来保护个人和企业免受各种意外损失相关联。20世纪50年代，当市场保险被认为成本高昂且无法全面防范纯粹风险时，其他形式的风险管理方法应运而生，成为市场保险的替代方案。衍生品作为风险管理工具的使用兴起于20世纪70年代，并在80年代迅速扩展，因为企业加强了其金融风险管理。国际风险监管始于20世纪80年代，金融机构开发了内部风险管理模型和资本计算公式，以对冲意外风险并减少监管资本。与此同时，风险管理的治理变得至关重要，综合风险管理被引入，并设立了首席风险官职位。然而，这些法规、治理规则和风险管理方法未能阻止始于2007年的金融危机。
