The paper investigates the role of global supply chains in explaining the trade collapse of 2008-2009 and the long-term variations observed in trade elasticity. Building on the empirical results obtained from a subset of input-output matrices and the exploratory analysis of a large and diversified sample of countries, a formal model is specified to measure the respective short-term and long-term dynamics of trade elasticity. The model is then used to formally probe the role of vertical integration in explaining changes in trade elasticity. Aggregated results on long-term trade elasticity tend to support the hypothesis that world economy has undertaken in the late 1980s a "traverse" between two underlying economic models. During this transition, the expansion of international supply chains determined an apparent increase in trade elasticity. Two supply chains related effects (the composition and the bullwhip effects) explain also the overshooting of trade elasticity that occurred during the 2008-2009 trade collapse. But vertical specialization is unable to explain the heterogeneity observed on a country and sectoral level, indicating that other contributive factors may also have been at work to explain the diversity of the observed results.

该论文探讨了全球供应链在解释2008-2009年贸易崩溃及贸易弹性长期变化中的作用。基于部分投入产出矩阵的实证结果和对多样化国家样本的探索性分析，研究构建了一个正式模型来衡量贸易弹性的短期与长期动态变化。随后通过该模型系统检验了垂直整合对贸易弹性变化的解释力。长期贸易弹性的汇总结果支持了世界经济在1980年代末经历两种基本经济模式"跨越"的假说。在此转型期间，国际供应链的扩张导致了贸易弹性的表面增长。两个与供应链相关的效应（结构效应和牛鞭效应）也解释了2008-2009年贸易崩溃期间贸易弹性的超调现象。但垂直专业化无法解释国家与行业层面观察到的异质性，这表明其他影响因素可能也在导致观测结果多样性方面发挥了作用。
