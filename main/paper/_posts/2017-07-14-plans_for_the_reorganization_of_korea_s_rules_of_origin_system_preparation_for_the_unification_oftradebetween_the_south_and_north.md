North-South trade has virtually been suspended due to the front of the May 24th Action due to the Cheonan Incident occurrence on March 26, 2010. Increased inter-Korean economic cooperation projects allowed construction of the Kaesong Industrial District, which started at Geumgang Mountain tourism in 1989. However, as unification is expected to take place in our nation, and not far into the future inevitably many feel, trade is expected to grow significantly even before the unification of North-South trade. In particular, recent government initiatives in Eurasia (2013.10) actively promoting unification through Infrastructure, etc., now is the time necessary for restructuring measures laid across the customs administration. The purpose of this study is to present the issues and problems related to the restructuring plan of customs system of preferential trade expanding to meet the objectives of these inter and non-preferential rules of origin compared with the north-south trade expansion and associated rules of origin.

由于2010年3月26日发生的"天安舰事件"引发的"5·24措施"，南北贸易实际上已处于中断状态。朝韩经济合作项目的增加使得开城工业园区的建设成为可能，这一合作始于1989年的金刚山旅游项目。然而，随着国家统一被普遍认为将在不远的将来实现，即使在南北统一之前，双边贸易也有望大幅增长。特别是近期政府推出的欧亚倡议（2013年10月）正通过基础设施建设等方式积极推动统一进程，当前正是需要对海关管理体系进行全面重组的关键时期。本研究旨在通过对比南北贸易扩展过程中优惠与非优惠原产地规则的实施情况，提出与海关制度重组方案相关的问题与挑战，以应对不断扩大的优惠贸易目标。
