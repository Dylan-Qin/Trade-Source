This article empirically investigates the impact of trade barriers on the world wine trade, focusing on trade costs impeding exports, including transport, tariffs, technical barriers and sanitary and phytosanitarystandards. A gravity model is estimated using data from the main importing and exporting countries for the years 1997 to 2010. The Poison Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimator accounts for heteroskedasticity and the presence of zero trade flows. Our results identify which regulations can adversely affect trade, providing useful information to policy-makers involved in negotiations on trade frictions. While sanitary and phytosanitary measures do not seem to obstruct exports, technical barriers have a varying impact on trade. A decreasing trend for tariffs has largely been compensated by more stringent technical barriers. The overall result is that frictions in the world wine trade have not changed during the past fifteen years.

本文实证研究了贸易壁垒对全球葡萄酒贸易的影响，重点考察阻碍出口的贸易成本，包括运输、关税、技术壁垒及卫生与植物检疫标准。研究采用1997至2010年间主要进出口国家的数据，通过引力模型进行估算，并运用泊松伪最大似然（PPML）估计量解决异方差性和零贸易流问题。研究结果明确了哪些法规可能对贸易产生不利影响，为参与贸易摩擦谈判的决策者提供了实用信息。研究发现，卫生与植物检疫措施似乎并未阻碍出口，而技术壁垒对贸易的影响则存在差异。关税下降的趋势在很大程度上被更严格的技术壁垒所抵消。总体结果表明，过去十五年间全球葡萄酒贸易的摩擦程度并未发生变化。
