There is increasing number of attacks aiming web servers; mostly at the application level. This is due to the fact that web services emerging rapidly without security considerations and network level solutions allow their connections tunnel through. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) can be configured to detect web attacks. These systems produce too many logs as they don’t have enough information about the network they are installed on. A prototype implementation of network-aware IDS is developed and its benefits are introduced.

针对网络服务器的攻击日益增多，主要集中在应用层面。这主要是因为网络服务在快速发展时未充分考虑安全性，而网络层面的解决方案又允许其连接隧道穿透。入侵检测系统（IDS）可配置用于识别网络攻击，但由于缺乏对所部署网络的足够了解，这些系统会产生大量日志。本文开发了一种网络感知型IDS原型系统，并介绍了其优势。
