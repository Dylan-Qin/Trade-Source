Spurred by the increased interest in applying “risk control” techniques in an asset allocation context, we offer a practitioner’s review of techniques that have been newly proposed or revived from academic history. We discuss minimum variance, “1/N” or equal-weighting, maximum diversification, volatility weighting and volatility targeting – and especially equal risk contribution or “risk parity”, a concept that has become a real buzz word. We start from a taxonomy of risk control techniques. We discuss their main characteristics and their pluses and minuses and we compare them against each other and against the maximum Sharpe Ratio criterion. We illustrate their implications by means of an empirical example. We also highlight some key papers from the vast and still growing literature in this field. All in all, we aim to provide a practical and critical guide to risk control strategies. It may help to demystify risk control techniques, to appreciate both the “forest” and the “trees”, and to judge these techniques on their potential merits in practical investment applications.

受资产配置领域对应用“风险控制”技术兴趣日益增长的推动，我们对新近提出或从学术历史中复兴的技术进行了实践性综述。我们探讨了最小方差法、“1/N”等权重配置、最大分散化、波动率加权与波动率目标策略——尤其是等风险贡献或“风险平价”这一已成为热门话题的概念。我们从风险控制技术的分类体系切入，分析其主要特征与优劣，将其相互对比并与最大夏普比率准则进行对照。通过实证案例阐明其应用效果，并精选该领域浩瀚且持续增长的文献中的关键论文加以评述。总体而言，我们致力于为风险控制策略提供实用而严谨的指南，助力破除风险控制技术的神秘面纱，既见“森林”亦见“树木”，从而在实际投资应用中基于潜在价值客观评判这些技术。
