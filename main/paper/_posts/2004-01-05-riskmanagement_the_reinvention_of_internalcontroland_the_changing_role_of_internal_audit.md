The publication of the Turnbull guidance represented a radical redefinition of the nature of internal control as a feature of corporate governance in the UK, explicitly aligning internal control with risk management. This paper explores this change, using sociological perspectives on risk and its conceptualisation to frame the debate about internal control and risk management within the UK corporate governance arena - the most recent manifestation of an ongoing competition for the control of economic and social resources. The paper demonstrates that developments in corporate governance reporting requirements offer opportunities for the appropriation of risk and its management by groups wishing to advance their own interests. This is illustrated by a review of recent changes in internal audit.

《特恩布尔指南》的发布标志着英国公司治理中内部控制性质的根本性重新定义，明确将内部控制与风险管理相挂钩。本文通过社会学视角对风险及其概念化的探讨，审视这一变革，从而在英国公司治理领域——这场持续争夺经济和社会资源控制权的最新表现形式中——构建关于内部控制与风险管理的讨论框架。研究表明，公司治理报告要求的发展为某些群体提供了将风险及其管理手段据为己有的机会，以此推进自身利益。这一现象通过近期内部审计领域的变革得到了印证。
