An important question for corporate finance officers is whether risk management systems, such as Value at Risk (VaR), currently are producing accurate results.  In contrast to previous research on assessing the accuracy of risk systems or VaR, which has focused on backtesting a large sample of  historical observations, we provide tools for real-time assessment, using a time window that varies adaptively with the data.  The objective is to quickly signal if the estimation process is systematically biased, subject to a specified rate of false detections.  For example, if the volatility is systematically underestimated by 25 percent our procedure detects this in an average of 25 observations.  Previous techniques have often backtested thousands of observations. We also discuss the trade-off between increasing detection power at the risk of detecting meaningless errors and suggest a parameter to specify the balance desired for a specific application.

企业财务主管面临的一个重要问题是，当前的风险管理系统（如风险价值VaR）是否能够产生准确结果。与以往通过回溯测试大量历史数据样本来评估风险系统或VaR准确性的研究不同，我们提供了实时评估工具，采用随数据自适应变化的时间窗口。该方法旨在快速识别估值过程是否存在系统性偏差，同时将误判率控制在指定范围内。例如，当波动率被系统性低估25%时，我们的程序平均仅需25次观测即可检测出偏差，而传统技术往往需要回溯数千次观测数据。我们还探讨了提高检测灵敏度与误检无关误差之间的权衡关系，并提出了一个参数来根据具体应用需求指定平衡点。
