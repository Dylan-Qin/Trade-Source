Trade in health products has been flourishing in recent years as the demand for better health has been growing throughout the world. At the same time, trade in health products is hampered by substantive trade barriers. In this paper, we present evidence that countries around the world still apply tariffs and nontariff measures that increase prices and limit the availability of health-related products such as pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and medical equipment. The case for liberalizing trade in these products is therefore strong. In addition, we show that improving trade facilitation performance, using the World Trade Organization’s Trade Facilitation Agreement as a starting point, can be linked to improved handling of health-related products such as vaccines which, in turn, would boost usage. In the last part of the paper, we study the price differences for insulin across countries. We observe that the price of insulin has various determinants, one of them being open trade: the higher the level of competition between manufacturers, the lower the price of insulin. In summary, lowering trade barriers on health products can make a substantive contribution to building up health systems and lowering out-of-pocket payments of patients.

近年来，随着全球对健康需求的不断增长，健康产品的贸易蓬勃发展。与此同时，健康产品贸易也受到实质性贸易壁垒的阻碍。本文提供的证据表明，世界各国仍在实施关税和非关税措施，这些措施提高了药品、疫苗和医疗设备等健康相关产品的价格并限制了其可获得性。因此，放开这些产品的贸易具有充分理由。此外，我们还表明，以世界贸易组织的《贸易便利化协定》为起点，提高贸易便利化绩效可以与改善疫苗等健康相关产品的处理相关联，从而促进其使用。在本文的最后部分，我们研究了各国胰岛素的价格差异。我们观察到，胰岛素的价格有多种决定因素，其中之一是开放的贸易：制造商之间的竞争越激烈，胰岛素的价格就越低。总之，降低健康产品的贸易壁垒可以为建立卫生系统和降低患者自付费用做出实质性贡献。
