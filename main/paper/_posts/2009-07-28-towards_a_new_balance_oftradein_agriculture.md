Trade in agriculture is linked to a whole range of economic, environmental, societal and future interests. For this reason, international regulation of trade in agricultural goods is highly contentious. While mainly directed towards an opening of markets, the WTO Agreement on Agriculture also has some entry points for ‘non trade concerns’. However, the agreement still looks like a casual patchwork that allows rather unsystematically for exemptions, without explicitly exposing the grounds that allow for them. The question arises of how the agreement could be drafted in a more structured way, in order to make sure that the economic objectives are efficiently pursued, and at the same time that human rights and environmental concerns are adequately taken account of‘ The concept of sustainable development provides for a methodical ‘seven step’ framework that gives guidance on integrated decision making processes. In this paper, this framework is partially applied to the Agreement on Agriculture. This working paper served as an introductory note to a brainstorming workshop on the subject that took place on 27 March 2009 at the World Trade Institute, University of Bern.

农产品贸易涉及一系列经济、环境、社会及未来利益。正因如此，国际农产品贸易监管始终存在高度争议。虽然《WTO农业协定》主要旨在推动市场开放，但也为"非贸易关切"设置了若干入口条款。不过该协定仍显得零散拼凑，其豁免条款缺乏系统性安排，亦未明确阐述豁免依据。由此引发的问题是：如何以更具结构性的方式重新拟定协定，在有效实现经济目标的同时，充分兼顾人权与环境关切？可持续发展概念提供的"七步法"框架，为综合决策流程提供了方法论指导。本文将该框架部分应用于《农业协定》分析。本工作论文系2009年3月27日伯尔尼大学世界贸易研究所专题研讨会的引言文件。
