The trade collapse that followed the recent financial crisis has led to a renewed interest on the measurement issues affecting international merchandise trade statistics in the new globalized economy.  The international fragmentation of industrial production blurs the concept of country of origin and calls for the production of new statistics on the domestic content of exports, with a view of estimating trade in value added.  Alongside, the international statistical community has revised in 2010 the concepts and definitions on both, international merchandise trade and trade in services statistics.  This paper discusses the various issues related to the concepts of "goods for processing" and  "intra firm trade" in trade statistics, and provides an overview of the method of analysing the impact of the fragmentation of production in international value chains.

近期金融危机后的贸易崩溃使人们重新关注影响新全球化经济中国际商品贸易统计的测量问题。工业生产的国际碎片化模糊了原产国的概念，要求编制关于出口国内含量的新统计数据，以估算增加值贸易。与此同时，国际统计界于2010年修订了国际商品贸易和服务贸易统计的概念和定义。本文讨论了贸易统计中"加工货物"和"公司内贸易"概念相关的各种问题，并概述了分析国际价值链中生产碎片化影响的方法。
