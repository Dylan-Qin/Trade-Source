While gravity models of trade perform well in empirical tests of both goods and services, efforts to tailor gravity models to the unique features of services trade have been limited. In particular, since trade in services can be conducted via travel or directly over the internet, trade costs vary both across trade partners and within products. This paper proposes that interacting the level of internet connectivity with a measure of physical distance can help shed light on the unique role of the internet as a direct means of trading services. On aggregate and for 7 of the 10 services sectors considered, increases in the level of internet connectivity across country-pairs significantly decrease distance costs for services trade. The decrease in distance costs ranges from 3–32 percent, depending on the sector and level of internet connectivity. However, this result does not hold for aggregate goods trade using the same sample of countries.

尽管引力模型在商品和服务贸易的实证检验中表现良好，但针对服务贸易独特特征定制引力模型的努力仍然有限。特别是由于服务贸易可以通过旅行或直接通过互联网进行，贸易成本在不同贸易伙伴之间和产品内部都存在差异。本文提出，将互联网连接水平与物理距离指标相互作用，有助于揭示互联网作为服务贸易直接渠道的独特作用。总体而言，在所考察的10个服务部门中有7个部门，国家间互联网连接水平的提高显著降低了服务贸易的距离成本。距离成本的降幅从3%到32%不等，具体取决于部门和互联网连接水平。然而，在使用相同国家样本的总体商品贸易中，这一结果并不成立。
