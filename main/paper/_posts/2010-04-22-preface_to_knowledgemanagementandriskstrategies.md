This book deals with knowledge management with an emphasis on knowledge risk, i.e., a general trend of knowledge value getting shorter and becoming temporary. The shortening of knowledge value lifespan will have a profound impact on companies’ employment policies, and employees’ strategies for gaining knowledge. How to manage knowledge selection, including personnel management, will be the key to survival for companies, when corporate competency shifts from stable business contacts to the quality of their offers, and when the value of knowledge, which is the foundation of products and services, is becoming more and more short-lived. Work-sharing and human resource derivatives are thus proposed as new concepts in order to deal with knowledge selection risk.

本书探讨了知识管理，重点聚焦于知识风险，即知识价值日益缩短并趋于临时化的普遍趋势。知识价值生命周期的缩短将对企业的雇佣政策和员工的知识获取策略产生深远影响。当企业竞争力从稳定的业务关系转向产品服务质量，当作为产品服务基石的知识价值愈发短暂时，如何管理知识选择（包括人员管理）将成为企业生存的关键。为此，书中提出了工作共享和人力资源衍生品这两个新概念，以应对知识选择风险。
