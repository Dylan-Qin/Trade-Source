The unprecedented burden that the COVID-19 pandemic has placed on individuals and healthcare systems highlights the need for rapid, reliable diagnostic techniques and easy to procure biological matrices to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus. While saliva contains detectable levels of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in infected individuals, several molecular assays that detect SARS-CoV-2 do not include saliva as an approved sample. We evaluate saliva as a clinical sample in detecting SARS-CoV-2 on the Cepheid Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV reverse transcription PCR assay and assess how removal of cellular debris and mucus through centrifugation impacts the performance of SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva. We further compare sensitivity of uncentrifuged and centrifuged saliva samples by performing limit of detection testing in contrived samples. Cohen’s kappa statistic was 0.78 between the gold-standard, nasopharyngeal swabs in viral transport media (NP-VTM), and saliva indicating significant agreement in SARS-CoV-2 detection between the sample types. The positive percent agreement (PPA) between centrifuged saliva and NP-VTM samples was 0.92 compared to a PPA of 0.85 between uncentrifuged saliva and NP-VTM. In contrived samples, heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 was reliably detected at a concentration of 51,852 copies/mL in uncentrifuged saliva and 2,074 copies/mL in centrifuged saliva. Ct values increased less consistently in uncentrifuged saliva compared to centrifuged saliva, as indicated by the coefficient of Determination R-squared values of 0.92 and 0.54, respectively. Our study indicates that saliva is a viable clinical sample for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in a reverse transcription PCR assay and removal of cellular debris improves sample performance.

COVID-19大流行给个人和医疗系统带来的空前压力，凸显了对快速可靠诊断技术及易于获取的生物样本以检测SARS-CoV-2病毒的需求。尽管感染者唾液中存在可检测水平的SARS-CoV-2病毒，但多项分子检测方法尚未将唾液列为获批样本。本研究评估了唾液作为临床样本在Cepheid Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV逆转录PCR检测中的表现，并探讨离心去除细胞碎片和粘液对唾液样本检测性能的影响。通过人工样本进行检测限测试，进一步比较了离心与非离心唾液样本的灵敏度。. . Cohen's kappa统计量显示，金标准鼻咽拭子病毒转运培养基（NP-VTM）与唾液样本间的检测一致性为0.78，表明两种样本类型在SARS-CoV-2检测中具有显著一致性。离心唾液与NP-VTM样本的阳性符合率（PPA）达0.92，而非离心唾液与NP-VTM的PPA为0.85。在人工样本中，未离心唾液对热灭活SARS-CoV-2的可靠检测浓度为51,852拷贝/毫升，离心后唾液则提升至2,074拷贝/毫升。未离心唾液的Ct值增长稳定性低于离心样本，其判定系数R平方值分别为0.54和0.92。本研究表明唾液可作为逆转录PCR检测SARS-CoV-2的有效临床样本，且去除细胞碎片能显著提升样本性能。
