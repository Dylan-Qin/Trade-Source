This paper compares the risk of structured exposures with that of defaultable corporate bonds with the same agency ratings. Risk is defined in a variety of ways including return volatility, value at risk, expected shortfall and betas with credit portfolios.

本文比较了结构化风险敞口与具有相同机构评级的可违约公司债券的风险。风险通过多种方式定义，包括收益波动率、风险价值、预期短缺以及与信用投资组合的贝塔系数。
