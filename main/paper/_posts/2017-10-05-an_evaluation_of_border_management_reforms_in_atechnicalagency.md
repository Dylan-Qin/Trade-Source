Impact evaluations of trade facilitation reforms have almost exclusively focused on reforms by data-rich customs agencies. Other "technical" agencies also intervene in the logistics of international trade, and do so in ways that can cause significant interruptions in the flow of the imported products they oversee. This paper is the first to evaluate a reform by a technical agency, namely, the agency responsible for food safety and animal health in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The data environment is much more challenging than in customs, but enables the investigation of novel questions. The study finds that on-the-ground practices regarding sampling of import shipments departed substantially from those planned in the reform. It finds little evidence that the reform was successful in its attempt to improve the targeting of risky shipments. There is limited evidence that the reform increased trade flows, but circumstances make it difficult to establish a strong causal link to the specific reform studied.

对贸易便利化改革的成效评估几乎全部集中于数据充足的海关机构所实施的改革。其他“技术性”机构同样介入国际贸易物流环节，其干预方式可能导致其监管的进口产品流动出现严重中断。本文首次对一家技术性机构——即前南斯拉夫马其顿共和国负责食品安全与动物健康的机构——实施的改革进行评估。该领域的数据环境比海关更为复杂，但也为研究新问题提供了可能。研究发现，在实际操作中针对进口货物的抽样检测与改革设计的方案存在显著偏差。几乎没有证据表明该改革在提高高风险货物筛查准确性方面取得成功。有有限证据显示改革促进了贸易流量增长，但客观条件使得难以确立其与所研究的具体改革之间存在明确因果关系。
