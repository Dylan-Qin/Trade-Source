China’s trade and investment relationship with Africa is important to both trading partners. For China, Africa represents a growing source of raw materials –most importantly crude oil, iron ore/concentrates, and copper-- which have helped fuel China’s rapid infrastructure development. For Africa, China represents a major trading partner and investor that provides it with cheap consumer products, buys its natural resources, and helps build its infrastructure.This briefing describes China’s trade and investment in Africa’s major raw material markets, and addresses the roles that Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and special economic zones have played in this relationship. This bilateral trade relationship is relevant to U.S. firms, as changing Chinese demand and supply conditions can impact global commodity prices and competitive conditions for U.S. firms operating in Africa.

中国与非洲的贸易和投资关系对双方都至关重要。对中国而言，非洲正成为日益重要的原材料来源地——尤其是原油、铁矿石/精矿和铜——这些资源助力了中国基础设施的快速发展。对非洲来说，中国既是重要的贸易伙伴，也是主要投资者，为其提供廉价消费品、购买自然资源并帮助建设基础设施。本简报概述了中国在非洲主要原材料市场的贸易与投资情况，并探讨了国有企业与经济特区在这一关系中的作用。这一双边贸易关系对美国企业具有影响，因为中国供需状况的变化可能波及全球大宗商品价格，并影响在非洲运营的美国企业的竞争环境。
