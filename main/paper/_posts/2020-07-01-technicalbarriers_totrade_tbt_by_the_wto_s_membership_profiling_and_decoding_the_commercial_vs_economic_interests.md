The paper brings out the pattern of notification of TBT measures under the WTO.  While, using the WTO grouping of countries does put the developing countries, who are usually adopting international standards, as the largest yearly notifier since 2004.  The pattern takes a completely different turn when the notifier is mapped to two other well-established grouping categories like the World Banks Income-based grouping and the U/NIDO’s industrial competitiveness index (CIP).  We come to the understanding that the high-income and industrially most advanced countries are the largest notifiers at the WTO.  This will have serious implication if the international trade policies are based on a wrong premise, that the developing countries are the most significant creators of global trade barriers. It is undoubtedly to impact the innovations and technological developments in the region as the only trade barrier tariff will be significantly decreased while the actual creators of trade barrier continue to escape as we do not identify them.

该论文揭示了WTO框架下技术性贸易壁垒(TBT)措施的通报模式。虽然采用WTO国家分类确实显示自2004年以来，通常采用国际标准的发展中国家成为年度最大通报方。但当采用世界银行基于收入的分类和联合国工发组织工业竞争力指数(CIP)这两种成熟分类体系时，通报模式呈现完全不同的态势。我们由此认识到：高收入且工业最发达国家才是WTO体系内最主要的通报方。如果国际贸易政策基于"发展中国家是全球贸易壁垒最主要制造者"这一错误前提，将产生严重后果。由于仅关税这一贸易壁垒将大幅降低，而真正的贸易壁垒制造者仍未被识别并持续逃避责任，这无疑将影响该地区的创新与技术发展。
