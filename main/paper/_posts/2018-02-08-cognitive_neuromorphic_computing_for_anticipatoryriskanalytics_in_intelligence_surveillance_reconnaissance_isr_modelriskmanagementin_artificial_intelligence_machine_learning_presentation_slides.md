Drawing upon insights shared in the MIT: AI & Machine Learning: Management and Leadership learning community of practice, the current Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) presentation advances the focus on "collective intelligence of people and computers" in the context of Cognitive Computing for Anticipatory Risk Analytics in Intelligence, Surveillance, & Reconnaissance (ISR). It defines as well as distinguishes multi-level Cognitive Computing process engineering frameworks of Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning as applied in KM practices of US and worldwide firms, governments, and ISR agencies from Cognitive-Neuromorphic Chips. A recent IEEE Spectrum report also published as "The Neuromorphic Chip's Make-or-Break Moment" observes that "Neuromorphic Chips Are Destined for Deep Learning—or Obscurity" given that the Neuromorphic Chip researchers "have hitched their wagon to deep learning's star." Drawing upon insights on Model Risk Management and Anticipatory Risk Analytics focus of top Wall Street investment banks and hedge funds beyond the Global Financial Crisis currently guiding national and global Cyber Risk Insurance industry practices, we demonstrate how Model Risk Management (MRM) and Anticipatory Risk Analytics are even more critical in the global and national domains of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR). The first operational use of AI and Deep Learning AI technologies in the Defense Intelligence Enterprise led by Project Maven and Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team is used as a case study for illustrating how Anticipatory Risk Analytics & MRM assume even greater significance at the  intersections of Space and Cyberspace wherein Offensive and Defensive Cybersecurity strategies, such as discussed in the recent 2015 and 2016 presentations at the Princeton Quant Trading Conference, are deployed.

借鉴麻省理工学院“人工智能与机器学习：管理与领导力”实践学习社区的分享见解，当前的情报、监视与侦察（ISR）演示进一步聚焦于“人与计算机的集体智能”，这一概念置于认知计算在ISR领域进行预见性风险分析的背景下。该演示定义并区分了人工智能（AI）与机器学习在美国及全球企业、政府和ISR机构知识管理（KM）实践中应用的多层次认知计算流程工程框架，以及与认知神经形态芯片的差异。近期《IEEE综览》发表的《神经形态芯片的成败时刻》报告指出，“神经形态芯片要么成就深度学习，要么沦为 obscurity”，因为相关研究者“已将未来押注于深度学习的星辰”。  基于全球金融危机后华尔街顶级投行和对冲基金在模型风险管理与预见性风险分析方面的实践，这些经验目前正指导着国家和全球网络风险保险行业的运作。我们展示了模型风险管理（MRM）与预见性风险分析在ISR的全球及国家层面更为关键的作用。以“专家计划”和算法战跨职能团队主导的国防情报体系中首次实战应用AI与深度学习技术为例，本研究通过案例阐明：在太空与网络空间交汇处部署攻防网络安全战略（如2015及2016年普林斯顿量化交易会议所述）时，预见性风险分析与MRM的重要性尤为凸显。
