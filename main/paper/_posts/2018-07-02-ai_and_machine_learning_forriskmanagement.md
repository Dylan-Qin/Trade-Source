We explore how artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning solutions are transforming risk management. A non-technical overview is first given of the main AI and machine learning techniques of benefit to risk management. Then an analysis, using current practice and empirical evidence, is carried out of the application of these techniques to the risk management fields of credit risk, market risk, operational risk, and compliance (‘RegTech’). We conclude with some thoughts on current limitations and views on how the field is likely to develop in the short- to medium-term. Overall, we present an optimistic picture of the role of AI and machine learning in risk management, but note some practical limitations around suitable data management policies, transparency, and lack of necessary skillsets within firms.

我们探讨人工智能（AI）与机器学习解决方案如何重塑风险管理。首先对有助于风险管理的主要AI与机器学习技术进行非技术性概述，随后结合当前实践与实证证据，分析这些技术在信用风险、市场风险、操作风险及合规（"监管科技"）等风险管理领域的应用。最后就当前局限性提出思考，并对该领域中短期发展趋势进行展望。总体而言，我们呈现了AI与机器学习在风险管理中的积极作用，但也指出企业在数据管理政策适配性、技术透明度及内部技能缺口等方面存在的现实制约。
