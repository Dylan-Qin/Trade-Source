Credit risk is the major challenge for risk managers and market regulators. Banks, regulators and central banks do not agree on how to measure credit risk and, more particularly, on how to compute the optimal capital that is necessary for protecting the different partners that share this risk. Asking banks to keep too much capital in reserve to cover credit risk can be a source of market distortion in risk management behavior. All these issues arise in part because credit risk is not well understood. So the contribution of Duffie and Singleton will be welcomed by the academics, regulators, and practitioners who consult it. The book has thirteen chapters, three appendices (two on affine processes), a comprehensive list of references, and an index (authors and subjects). It covers all subjects related to credit risk. The main focus is modeling credit risk: measuring portfolio credit risk and pricing different securities exposed to credit risk. The focus on credit risk management is less important. The book covers with great clarity the relevant topics of credit risk. It reflects the strong academic competence of the authors. This is certainly the best reference on credit risk available on the market. I recommend the book to academics and professionals, and also for the teaching of credit risk at Masters and PhD levels in finance and economics.

信用风险是风险经理和市场监管者面临的主要挑战。银行、监管机构和中央银行在如何衡量信用风险，尤其是如何计算保护风险分担各方所需的最优资本方面存在分歧。要求银行留存过多资本以覆盖信用风险，可能导致风险管理行为的市场扭曲。这些问题的出现部分源于人们对信用风险的理解尚不充分。因此，达菲和辛格尔顿的著作将受到学术界、监管机构和从业者的欢迎。全书共十三章，含三个附录（其中两个涉及仿射过程）、详尽的参考文献列表及作者与主题索引，涵盖了信用风险相关所有议题。核心内容聚焦信用风险建模：包括投资组合信用风险度量及信用风险相关证券定价。信用风险管理并非本书重点。该书以极高清晰度阐述了信用风险关键课题，彰显了作者深厚的学术造诣。这无疑是当前市场上最权威的信用风险参考著作。我向学术界与专业人士强烈推荐此书，同时也建议将其用于金融经济领域硕士及博士阶段的信用风险教学。
