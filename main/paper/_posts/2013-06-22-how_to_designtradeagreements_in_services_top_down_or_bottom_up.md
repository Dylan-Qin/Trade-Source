This paper deals with claims, recently raised in various circles, that structural faults in the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) have prevented WTO Members from advancing services liberalization under the Agreement. The GATS is generally associated in this context with a bottom-up (positive-list) scheduling approach where the sectors on which trade commitments are undertaken are selected individually. This is claimed to be less efficient, in terms of liberalization effects, than alternative approaches under which everything is considered to be fully committed unless specifically excluded (top-down or negative listing). However, a closer look at services negotiations conducted in various settings, including the Doha-Round process, WTO accession cases and different types of regional trade agreements, suggests that such structural issues have limited, if any, impact on the results achieved. What ultimately matters are not negotiating or scheduling techniques, but the political impetus that the governments concerned are ready to generate.

本文针对近期各方提出的关于《服务贸易总协定》(GATS)存在结构性缺陷、阻碍世贸组织成员推进服务贸易自由化的主张展开探讨。在此背景下，GATS通常被认为采用自下而上(肯定列表)的承诺方式，即各成员自主选择开放的服务部门。有观点指出，相较于"除非明确排除否则全面开放"(自上而下或否定列表)的承诺模式，这种模式在自由化效果上效率较低。然而，深入考察多哈回合谈判、世贸组织加入案例及各类区域贸易协定中的服务贸易谈判实践可发现，此类结构性问题对实际谈判成果的影响微乎其微。最终起决定性作用的并非谈判技巧或承诺方式，而是相关政府推动自由化的政治意愿。
