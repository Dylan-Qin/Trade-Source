This paper assesses the scope for and implications of trade measures for environmental purposes in the WTO and the European Union. The assessment is illustrated by a number of cases that have tested the limits of legal provisions in the WTO and EU dealing with issues arising at the intersection of trade liberalization and environmental protection such as the maintenance of domestic health, safety and environmental standards and cross-border activity. The conclusions of the paper point to a trend towards the regionalization of trade and environment rule making and implementation, with the EU moving along its distinctive policy making path, and the GATT/WTO barely moving at all. The paper demonstrates the limitations of judicial and quasi-judicial means of dealing with trade measures for non-trade purposes and argues for approaching the legitimacy of such measures through the lens of process rather than outcome, expanding participation and interest representation in national and international decision- and policy-making.

本文评估了世界贸易组织（WTO）和欧盟中出于环境目的采取贸易措施的范围及其影响。评估通过一系列案例加以说明，这些案例检验了WTO和欧盟法律条款在处理贸易自由化与环境保护交叉问题（如维护国内健康、安全与环境标准以及跨境活动）时的界限。论文的结论指出，贸易与环境规则制定及实施呈现区域化趋势——欧盟正沿着其独特的政策制定路径推进，而关贸总协定/WTO则几乎停滞不前。研究揭示了通过司法和准司法手段处理非贸易目的贸易措施的局限性，并主张应从程序而非结果的角度审视此类措施的合法性，同时扩大国家和国际决策及政策制定过程中的参与度与利益代表性。
