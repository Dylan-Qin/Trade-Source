The most extreme risk are those that threaten the entirety of human civilization, known as global catastrophic risks. The very extreme nature of global catastrophes makes them both challenging to analyze and important to address. They are challenging to analyze because they are largely unprecedented and because they involve the entire global human system. They are important to address because they threaten everyone around the world and future generations. Global catastrophic risks also pose some deep dilemmas. One dilemma occurs when actions to reduce global catastrophic risk could harm society in other ways, as in the case of geoengineering to reduce catastrophic climate change risk. Another dilemma occurs when reducing one global catastrophic risk could increase another, as in the case of nuclear power reducing climate change risk while increasing risks from nuclear weapons. The complex, interrelated nature of global catastrophic risk suggests a research agenda in which the full space of risks are assessed in an integrated fashion in consideration of the deep dilemmas and other challenges they pose. Such an agenda can help identify the best ways to manage these most extreme risks and keep human civilization safe.

最极端的风险是那些威胁整个人类文明的全球性灾难风险。全球性灾难的极端性质使得它们既难以分析又至关重要。难以分析是因为它们大多史无前例，且涉及全球人类系统；至关重要则在于它们威胁着全世界所有人及子孙后代。全球性灾难风险还带来若干深刻困境：其一是降低灾难风险的措施可能在其他方面损害社会，例如为缓解灾难性气候变化风险实施的地球工程；其二是降低某类全球灾难风险可能加剧另一类风险，比如核能虽能降低气候变化风险，却会增大核武器威胁。全球性灾难风险具有复杂互联的特性，这要求建立综合评估所有风险的研究框架，同时考量其引发的深层困境与其他挑战。此类研究有助于找到管理极端风险、守护人类文明的最佳途径。
