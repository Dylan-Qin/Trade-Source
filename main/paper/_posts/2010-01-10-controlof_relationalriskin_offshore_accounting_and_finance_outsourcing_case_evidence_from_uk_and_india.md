Many companies in USA and Western Europe are taking advantage of developments in information technology and outsourcing parts of the accounting process to vendors in other parts of the world. Offshore outsourcing of accounting presents some unique risks, control problems and challenges. In this paper we focus on the control of relational risk, a form of risk concerned with the potential for an outsourcing partner's opportunistic behaviour. Drawing on multiple case studies of global outsourcing relationships involving India based vendors and clients in UK, this paper identifies relational risks and the controls adopted by vendors and clients. It is argued that the findings have more general implications for the management of offshore outsourcing of administrative functions.

美国和西欧的许多公司正利用信息技术的发展，将部分会计流程外包给世界其他地区的供应商。会计离岸外包带来了一些独特的风险、控制问题和挑战。本文重点关注关系风险的控制，这类风险涉及外包合作伙伴机会主义行为的潜在可能。通过研究以印度供应商和英国客户为主的全球外包关系多案例，本文识别了关系风险及供需双方采取的控制措施。研究结果对行政职能离岸外包管理具有更广泛的启示意义。
