There are a variety of strategies which are designed to manage foreign exchange risk. Each of them, however, is constructed under specific assumptions, for a specific risk profile. It is often the case that several strategies are applicable to a given scenario. The question arises as to which strategy would be expected to yield the best results in a given scenario. The current study addresses this issue empirically, using a set of simulated foreign exchange cash flows to compare the profits resulting from the use of different foreign exchange risk management strategies. The risk management strategies considered for the study are: forward currency contacts, currency options, and cross-currency hedges. The study analyzes and evaluates these foreign exchange risk management strategies to find out which of the strategies is appropriate in particular situations.

存在多种旨在管理外汇风险的策略。然而，每种策略都是基于特定假设、针对特定风险状况构建的。在特定情境下，往往有多个策略适用。问题在于，在给定情境中哪种策略有望产生最佳效果。本研究通过实证方法探讨这一问题，利用一组模拟外汇现金流来比较采用不同外汇风险管理策略所产生的利润。研究中考虑的风险管理策略包括：远期外汇合约、货币期权和交叉货币对冲。研究分析并评估这些外汇风险管理策略，以确定在特定情况下哪种策略最为适用。
