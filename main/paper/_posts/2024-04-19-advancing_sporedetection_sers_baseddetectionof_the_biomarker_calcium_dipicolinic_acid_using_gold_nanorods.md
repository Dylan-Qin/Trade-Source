Detecting bacterial spores is crucial for safeguarding public health, preventing bioterrorism threats, and ensuring food safety. Rapid and accurate detection methods enable timely response to potential outbreaks and facilitate effective risk mitigation strategies. In this study, we employ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to detect Bacillus thuringiensis spores by targeting the biomarker calcium chelate dipicolinic acid (CaDPA). Our method involves spore disruption via sonication to release CaDPA, followed by SERS detection using gold nanorods. We demonstrate the successful detection of biogenic CaDPA in complex samples containing disrupted spore constituents. Our method clearly distinguishes the CaDPA signal from other spore components and noise sources. Notably, it enables the detection of CaDPA at dilutions corresponding to single-spore levels. The dilutions and detection limit are validated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). These findings highlight the potential of combining SERS with CaDPA as a sensitive and specific technique for bacterial spore detection, with implications for various fields requiring rapid and reliable spore identification.

检测细菌孢子对于保障公共卫生、防范生物恐怖主义威胁以及确保食品安全至关重要。快速准确的检测方法能及时应对潜在疫情爆发，并助力制定有效的风险缓解策略。本研究采用表面增强拉曼光谱（SERS）技术，通过靶向生物标志物钙螯合吡啶二羧酸（CaDPA）来检测苏云金芽孢杆菌孢子。我们的方法通过超声破碎孢子释放CaDPA，随后使用金纳米棒进行SERS检测。实验证明，该方法能成功检测含破碎孢子成分的复杂样本中的生物源性CaDPA，并能清晰区分CaDPA信号与其他孢子组分及噪声源。值得注意的是，该方法可实现单孢子水平对应稀释度下的CaDPA检测，其稀释梯度与检测限通过高效液相色谱（HPLC）验证。这些发现揭示了SERS结合CaDPA检测作为一种高灵敏度、高特异性细菌孢子检测技术的潜力，对需要快速可靠孢子鉴别的多个领域具有重要应用价值。
