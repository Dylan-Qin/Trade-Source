The Prediction & Control Problem: Typically, prediction is based upon historical data where plenty of data is available over extended time duration within relatively "static" linear and normal contexts. Such relatively deterministic, and, [statistically] linear and normal contexts are suitable for typical AI-ML-DL driven analytics and data science driven prediction based on history. The Prediction Problem occurs wherein either past data is unavailable or is sparse as in case of COVID 19 wherein future prediction is based upon negligible to sparse [but increasingly cumulative] context-specific data in real time while the specific contexts are dynamically evolving. Prediction is typically used for Control as in the context of "flattening the curve" [which is a function of both minimizing the "spread" of the COVID 19 risk such as by using 'social distancing' while maximizing the "capacity" to mitigate the COVID 19 risk such as by increasing hospital bed capacity] in context of each "hot spot" [Different 'hot spots' may be characterized by differences in severity and intensity of the outbreak risk given context-specific determinants such as density and connectedness that may determine the rate and speed of spread of such risk.]

预测与控制问题：通常，预测是基于历史数据进行的，这些数据在相对“静态”的线性和正态环境中长期大量存在。这种相对确定且[统计上]线性和正态的环境，适合典型的由AI-ML-DL驱动的分析和数据科学驱动的基于历史的预测。预测问题出现在过去数据不可用或稀少的情况下，例如COVID-19疫情中，未来预测是基于实时可忽略到稀少[但逐渐累积]的特定情境数据，而这些特定情境正在动态演变。预测通常用于控制，例如在“拉平曲线”的背景下[这是最小化COVID-19风险的“传播”（如通过“社交距离”）和最大化缓解COVID-19风险的“能力”（如增加医院床位容量）两者的函数]，针对每个“热点”区域[不同的“热点”可能因疫情风险的严重程度和强度而异，这取决于特定情境的决定因素，如人口密度和连通性，这些因素可能决定此类风险的传播速度和范围。]
