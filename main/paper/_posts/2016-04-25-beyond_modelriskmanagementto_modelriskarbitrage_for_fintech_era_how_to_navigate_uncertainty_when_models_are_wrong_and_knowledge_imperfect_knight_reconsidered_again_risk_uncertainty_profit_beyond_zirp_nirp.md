The 2016 invited research presentation at the Princeton Quant Trading Conference proposes two new financial innovations and their interrelationships: ‘Model Risk Arbitrage’ for ‘Open Systems Finance’. It develops the new framework of Model Risk Arbitrage for profit-maximization in the emerging global financial markets characterized by unprecedented uncertainty, complexity, and, rapid discontinuous changes. It develops the new framework of ‘Open Systems Finance’ aligned with George Soros’ Reflexivity Theory based upon empirical practical experience in financial markets as contrasted from ‘Closed Systems Finance’ models characterizing most of classical and academic Finance and Economics theory. Aligning with George Soros’ Reflexivity Theory and associated Hegelian Dialectic, it characterizes ‘reflexivity’ as the missing link in Finance theory, research, and, practice that can help understand the effect of feedback and feedforward loops across Time and Space in information-based non-deterministic ‘open systems’ Finance. Consistently, it is based on the Hegelian Dialectic characterizing the [profit-maximizing] Black Hat approach as compared with the [risk-optimizing] White Hat approach. The Black Hat approach exploits all vulnerabilities at all levels of all systems to maximize advantage over the White Hat approach. Similarly, Model Risk Arbitrage exploits all model risks at all levels of all systems to maximize advantage over Model Risk Management. Open Systems Finance framework advances beyond ‘silo’ based mindsets characterizing academic theory and practices and thus serves as foundation for developing and executing Model Risk Arbitrage strategies for profit-maximization. The current presentation advances upon last two decades of our applied and industrial research and global practices on post-WWW era management and modeling frameworks of uncertainty and risk management. It builds upon our research and practices on designing self-adaptive complex systems for high velocity hyper-turbulent environments characterized by high uncertainty.  The 2016 invited presentation is the sequel to the 2015 invited presentation at the Princeton Quant Trading Conference which advanced Frank Knight’s (1921) original treatise developing the foundation of Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit for the Cyber Era.  The 2015 presentation laid the foundation for examining modeling and management of ‘true uncertainty’ which is distinct from [theoretical] risk and “which forms the basis of a valid theory of profit and accounts for the divergence between actual and theoretical competition” (Knight 1921). That presentation further advanced upon prior research in collaboration with world’s distinguished cybersecurity experts affiliated with the Air Force Research Lab and Wall Street’s leading risk management experts from top investment banks such as JP Morgan. That work developed the original basis for understanding emerging Cyber Finance practices at the intersection of leading-edge developments in both Finance and Cybersecurity related risk and uncertainty management. In addition, it also developed robust computational quantitative finance modeling foundations for industrywide Cyber Risk Insurance Modeling practices.

2016年普林斯顿量化交易会议特邀研究报告提出了两项金融创新及其相互关系：面向"开放系统金融"的"模型风险套利"。该研究构建了"模型风险套利"新框架，旨在以前所未有的不确定性、复杂性和快速不连续变化为特征的新兴全球金融市场中实现利润最大化。研究同时发展了与乔治·索罗斯反身性理论相契合的"开放系统金融"新框架，该框架基于金融市场实证经验，有别于表征传统学院派金融经济理论的"封闭系统金融"模型。研究将"反身性"定位为金融理论、研究与实践领域缺失的关键环节，结合黑格尔辩证法与索罗斯反身性理论，阐释了这种基于信息的非确定性"开放系统"金融中跨越时空的反馈与前馈循环效应。研究采用黑格尔辩证法，将利润最大化的"黑帽策略"与风险优化的"白帽策略"进行对比——黑帽策略通过利用各系统层面的所有漏洞来最大化对白帽策略的优势，同理，模型风险套利通过利用各系统层面的所有模型风险来最大化对模型风险管理的优势。开放系统金融框架突破了学术理论与实践中常见的"孤岛思维"，为开发与执行利润最大化的模型风险套利策略奠定基础。本次报告基于我们过去二十年在后互联网时代管理与风险建模框架的应用研究及全球实践，延续了针对高不确定性超湍流环境设计自适应复杂系统的研究成果。作为2015年普林斯顿量化交易会议特邀报告的续篇，本次报告进一步发展了弗兰克·奈特(1921)关于网络时代风险、不确定性与利润基础的开创性论述。2015年报告为区分于(理论)风险的"真实不确定性"建模与管理研究奠定基础——奈特指出这种不确定性"构成了利润有效理论的基础，并解释了实际竞争与理论竞争的差异"。该研究曾与美国空军研究实验室顶尖网络安全专家及摩根大通等顶级投行风险管理专家合作，为理解金融与网络安全交叉领域的前沿风险管理实践建立了理论基础，同时为行业级网络风险保险建模实践奠定了稳健的计算量化金融建模基础。
