With the increase in cyber attacks, the issue of risk to web services is of great concern, making it particularly important to apply new techniques to improve the performance of intrusion detection systems. In this study, we present a novel application of a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on pseudo-count exploration for network intrusion anomaly detection. We describe how to introduce a pseudo-count exploration (PCE) approach for supervised intrusion anomaly detection based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms and construct an exploration space based on their architecture. For intrusion detection systems (IDSs), setting up dense extrinsic rewards consistent with intrusion detection is very difficult because the identifications are all manual and cannot be automatically identified and these identified intrusion events are stored to form a network feature dataset. We select the NSL-KDD and AWID datasets and compare our proposed new models based on the pseudo-count exploration of double deep Q networks (PCE-DDQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PCE-PPO) with existing machine learning and traditional DRL techniques. It is found that our models significantly outperform the other two types of models in terms of detection performance, especially on the AWID dataset where the anomaly distribution is highly unbalanced. In addition in terms of training cost, our model is faster than the traditional DRL model. We also discuss the effect of discount factor size on the detection ability of the models, and we select Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves as evaluation metrics in addition to the F1 score metrics commonly used for the NSL-KDD and AWID datasets. These two metrics can give a more objective evaluation of the extremely unbalanced dataset, and our models achieve excellent performance on all three types of metrics.

随着网络攻击的增加，网络服务面临的风险问题备受关注，这使得应用新技术提升入侵检测系统性能显得尤为重要。本研究提出了一种基于伪计数探索的深度强化学习算法在网络入侵异常检测中的创新应用。我们阐述了如何将伪计数探索（PCE）方法引入基于深度强化学习（DRL）算法的有监督入侵异常检测，并基于其架构构建探索空间。对于入侵检测系统（IDS）而言，由于所有识别均为人工操作且无法自动完成，这些已识别的入侵事件被存储形成网络特征数据集，因此建立与入侵检测相一致的密集外部奖励机制极为困难。我们选用NSL-KDD和AWID数据集，将提出的基于双深度Q网络伪计数探索（PCE-DDQN）和近端策略优化（PCE-PPO）的新模型与现有机器学习及传统DRL技术进行对比。研究发现，我们的模型在检测性能上显著优于另外两类模型，尤其在异常分布高度不平衡的AWID数据集上表现突出。此外在训练成本方面，我们的模型比传统DRL模型更为高效。我们还探讨了折扣因子大小对模型检测能力的影响，除NSL-KDD和AWID数据集常用的F1分数指标外，额外选取未加权平均召回率（UAR）和受试者工作特征（ROC）曲线作为评估标准。这两项指标能对极端不平衡数据集给出更客观的评价，而我们的模型在全部三类指标上均表现出卓越性能。
