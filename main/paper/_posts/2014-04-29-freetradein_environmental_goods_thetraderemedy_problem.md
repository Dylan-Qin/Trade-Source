In late June of 2013, in a major speech on climate change, President Obama announced a plan “to launch negotiations toward global free trade in environmental goods and services,” including clean energy technology. Removing or lowering tariffs on goods such as solar panels and wind turbines would lead to lower prices and greater availability of those products. However, there is one major hurdle to progress in this area: While normal tariffs are covered by the APEC declaration, special tariffs imposed through the so-called “trade remedies” — antidumping (AD) duties, countervailing duties (CVD), and safeguards — are not.

2013年6月下旬，奥巴马总统在一场关于气候变化的重要演讲中宣布了一项计划，旨在"启动关于环境商品和服务全球自由贸易的谈判"，包括清洁能源技术。取消或降低太阳能电池板和风力涡轮机等商品的关税将导致这些产品的价格下降和供应增加。然而，这一领域的进展面临一个主要障碍：虽然亚太经合组织宣言涵盖了正常关税，但通过所谓的"贸易救济"——反倾销税、反补贴税和保障措施——征收的特殊关税并不包括在内。
