War causes disruption. In this study, we examine risk preferences and self-control behaviors of young children from Syria as they were exposed to the Syrian war. We measure children’s risk preferences and self-control ability using incentivized games. To discern the effect of the war from other confounding effects, we compare children born in Syria and exposed to the war with children living in the Turkish side of the border and not exposed to the war. We find that conflict affects behavior. After controlling for demographics and cognitive ability, children exposed to the war take more risks. We do not find a significant impact of exposure to the war on self-control or on impulsivity.

战争造成混乱。本研究中，我们考察了暴露于叙利亚战争的叙利亚幼童的风险偏好与自控行为。通过激励性游戏测量儿童的风险偏好与自控能力。为区分战争影响与其他混杂因素，我们将叙利亚境内经历战争的儿童与边境土耳其一侧未经历战争的儿童进行对比。研究发现冲突会影响行为：在控制人口统计特征与认知能力后，经历战争的儿童更倾向于冒险。但战争暴露对自控力或冲动性未产生显著影响。
