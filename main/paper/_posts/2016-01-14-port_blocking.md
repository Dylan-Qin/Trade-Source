Executive Summary: The term “port blocking” refers to the practice of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) identifying Internet traffic by the combination of port number and transport protocol, and blocking it entirely. Port blocking thus affects the traffic associated with a particular combination of port number and transport protocol on that ISP, regardless of source or destination IP address. The practice can potentially prevent the use of particular applications altogether by blocking the ports those applications use. Port blocks can be deployed in a range of network locations, from where the ISP connects with other networks to data centers and customer locations. The Internet was built around the premise of an open and shared environment. Additionally, Internet standards assume all hosts on the global Internet can connect directly to each other, on any specified port number. The practical reality is that blocking of Internet port numbers, either in the short or long term, is a technique that has been used by both wireline and wireless network providers for various reasons for over a decade. One of the original and enduring motivations for blocking ports is to prevent network attacks and abuse associated with particular application protocols.  Some network and security administrators view port blocking as a critical tool for securing systems and information, and see it as part of the ISP’s mission to manage the security risk to its users from theft and destruction of personal information, business records, and other critical electronic forms of information. TCP port 25, used for sending email, is an example of a port that is blocked by some operators to prevent network abuse – such as spam email. Port blocking has also been used to enforce ISPs’ terms of service. Likewise, port blocking was once viewed as a useful tool for managing capacity and bandwidth-intensive applications such as peer-to-peer file-sharing applications on enterprise and university networks. However, increased network capacity and a variety of developments in the application space have caused most residential ISPs to seek other ways of managing capacity. Finally, though rare, port blocking has at times been used to hinder competing applications, such as Voice over IP (VoIP). Port blocking is among a set of tools and tactics (Network Address Translation (NAT) being the other major example) that can compromise the original intent of ports: to provide reliable local addresses so that end systems can manage multiple communications at once. Port blocking can complicate application design and development and create uncertainty about whether applications will function properly when they are deployed. Port blocking can also cause applications to not function properly or “break” by preventing applications from using the ports they were designed to use.  One of the outcomes of port blocking is an increase in the use of “port overloading.”  Port overloading is a tactic whereby application developers will design applications to use a common port, in order to minimize the chance of a port blocking practice impacting the usability of that application. Importantly, it may not be obvious to Internet users why an application affected by port blocking is not working properly, because the application may simply be unable to connect or fail silently. If error messages are provided, they may not contain specific details as to the cause of the problem. Users may seek assistance from the ISP’s customer service, online documentation, or other knowledgeable sources if they cannot diagnose the problem themselves. The fact that the problem could alternatively be caused by home networking equipment or a software-based port block complicates the process of diagnosis. Users’ ability to respond to port blocking depends on their technical sophistication and the extent to which workarounds are available. Overcoming port blocking may require the user to install a software update, change a configuration setting, request an opt-out from the ISP, or to upgrade their level of service (for example from residential to business). If these options are not available, or if users or customers lack the knowledge or willingness to pursue them, users may be prevented from using the blocked application altogether, or they may have to switch to a different application or a different network (from wireless to wireline, for example). Because port blocking can affect how particular Internet applications function, its use has the potential to be anti-competitive, discriminatory, otherwise motivated by non-technical factors, or construed as such. As a result, the Broadband Internet Technical Advisory Group (BITAG) has a number of suggested practices when it comes to port blocking: ISPs should avoid port blocking unless they have no reasonable alternatives available for preventing unwanted traffic and protecting users. Further, if port blocking is deemed necessary, it should only be used for the purposes of protecting the implementing ISP’s network and users. Port blocking should not be used for ongoing capacity management, to enforce non-security terms of service, or to disadvantage competing applications. ISPs that can reasonably provide to their users opt-out provisions or exceptions to their port blocking policies should do so.  Whether opt-out provisions can be supported may depend on the particulars of the access network technology, the location port blocking is implemented in the network, administrative complexity, cost, and other factors. ISPs should publicly disclose their port blocking policies. The information should be readily available to both customers and non-customers alike, and should be as informative and concise as possible. For example, port blocking policies could be provided on the ISP’s public facing website, on a page dedicated to...[see report for remainder of recommendations].

执行摘要：“端口阻断”一词指的是互联网服务提供商（ISP）通过端口号与传输协议的组合来识别互联网流量，并完全阻断该流量的做法。因此，端口阻断会影响该ISP上与特定端口号和传输协议组合相关的所有流量，无论源或目标IP地址如何。这种做法可能通过阻断应用程序使用的端口，彻底阻止特定应用的使用。端口阻断可部署在从ISP与其他网络连接到数据中心和客户位置的各种网络节点中。  . . 互联网的构建前提是一个开放共享的环境。此外，互联网标准假设全球互联网上的所有主机可以在任何指定端口上直接相互连接。但现实情况是，无论是短期还是长期，互联网端口号的阻断技术已被有线和无线网络提供商出于各种原因使用超过十年。端口阻断最初且持久的动机之一是防止与特定应用协议相关的网络攻击和滥用。一些网络和安全管理员将端口阻断视为保护系统和信息安全的关键工具，并将其视为ISP管理用户信息安全风险（如个人信息、业务记录和其他关键电子信息的盗窃或破坏）的职责之一。例如，用于发送电子邮件的TCP端口25被某些运营商阻断，以防止网络滥用（如垃圾邮件）。  . . 端口阻断也被用于强制执行ISP的服务条款。同样，端口阻断曾被视为管理容量和带宽密集型应用（如企业和大学网络中的点对点文件共享应用）的有效工具。然而，网络容量的提升以及应用领域的多种发展使得大多数住宅ISP寻求其他方式管理容量。最后，尽管罕见，端口阻断有时也被用于阻碍竞争性应用（如互联网语音协议（VoIP））。  . . 端口阻断属于一系列可能损害端口原始意图的工具和策略（另一主要例子是网络地址转换（NAT）），即提供可靠的本地地址，使终端系统能够同时管理多个通信。端口阻断可能使应用设计和开发复杂化，并导致应用在部署时是否正常工作的不确定性。它还可能导致应用无法正常运行或“失效”，因为应用无法使用其设计使用的端口。端口阻断的一个结果是“端口复用”使用的增加。端口复用是应用开发者设计应用使用通用端口的策略，以最小化端口阻断对该应用可用性的影响。  . . 重要的是，互联网用户可能无法明确知道受端口阻断影响的应用为何无法正常工作，因为应用可能只是无法连接或静默失败。如果提供错误消息，可能不会包含具体的问题原因。用户若无法自行诊断问题，可能会向ISP的客户服务、在线文档或其他知识来源寻求帮助。由于问题也可能由家庭网络设备或基于软件的端口阻断引起，诊断过程变得更加复杂。  . . 用户应对端口阻断的能力取决于其技术水平和可用的解决方法。克服端口阻断可能需要用户安装软件更新、更改配置设置、向ISP申请退出阻断或升级服务级别（例如从住宅升级到商业）。如果这些选项不可用，或用户缺乏相关知识或意愿，用户可能完全无法使用被阻断的应用，或不得不切换到其他应用或网络（例如从无线切换到有线）。  . . 由于端口阻断可能影响特定互联网应用的功能，其使用可能具有反竞争性、歧视性、受非技术因素驱动或被如此解读。因此，宽带互联网技术咨询组（BITAG）提出了一些建议做法：ISP应避免端口阻断，除非没有其他合理替代方案来阻止不需要的流量和保护用户。此外，如果端口阻断确有必要，应仅用于保护实施阻断的ISP网络和用户。端口阻断不应用于持续的容量管理、强制执行非安全相关的服务条款或损害竞争性应用。ISP应尽可能为用户提供退出端口阻断政策的选项或例外。  . . 是否支持退出选项可能取决于接入网络技术的具体情况、端口阻断在网络中的实施位置、管理复杂性、成本等因素。ISP应公开披露其端口阻断政策。相关信息应易于客户和非客户获取，并尽可能简明扼要。例如，端口阻断政策可在ISP的公开网站上提供，放在专门页面中……[其余建议详见报告]。
