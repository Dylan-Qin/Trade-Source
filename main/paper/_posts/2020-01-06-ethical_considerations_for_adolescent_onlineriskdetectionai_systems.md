We seek to develop future Artificial Intelligent (AI) risk detection algorithms to address keeping adolescents safe by providing accurate and customized services to teens and their parents. Training such accurate algorithms needs data of minor which raises ethical challenges. Also, the proper use of such systems is another issue. In this workshop, we hope to gain more insights about possible approaches to address these ethical challenges.

我们致力于开发未来的人工智能（AI）风险检测算法，通过为青少年及其父母提供精准定制化服务来保障未成年人安全。训练此类精准算法需要涉及未成年人的数据，这引发了伦理挑战。此外，如何正确使用这类系统也是另一个问题。本次研讨会旨在深入探讨应对这些伦理挑战的可能途径。
