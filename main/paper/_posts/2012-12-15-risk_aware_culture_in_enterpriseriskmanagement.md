Industries companies increasingly recognize the importance of  cultural aspects of risk management. Human is a key element of conditioning the effectiveness of the im-plementation of enterprise risk management process.  Since organizations have very similar technologies, systems and structures, some argue that the difference in perfor-mance is largely due to systematic differences in the behavior of their employees, in other words their risk-aware culture. This paper presents  key aspects of risk-aware culture theory based on "Safety Culture Application Guide" proposed by  PRISM (Process Industries Safety Management).

各行业公司日益认识到风险管理中文化层面的重要性。人是制约企业风险管理流程实施成效的关键要素。鉴于各组织所采用的技术、系统与架构高度趋同，有观点认为绩效差异主要源于员工行为的系统性差异，即风险意识文化的不同。本文基于流程工业安全管理协会（PRISM）提出的《安全文化应用指南》，阐述了风险意识文化理论的核心要素。
