The paper discusses a number of issues related to the treatment of trade credit internationally, a priori (treatment by banking regulators) and a posteriori (treatment by debtors and creditors in the case of default), which are currently of interest to the trade finance community, in particular the traditional providers of trade credit and guarantees, such as banks, export credit agencies, regional development banks, and multilateral  agencies. The paper does not deal with the specific issue of regulation of official insured-export credit, under the OECD Arrangement, which is a specific matter left out of this analysis. Traditionally, trade finance has received preferred treatment on the part of national and international regulators, as well as by international financial agencies in the treatment of trade finance claims, on grounds that trade finance was one of the safest, most collateralized, and self-liquidating forms of trade finance. Preferred treatment of trade finance also reflects the systemic importance of trade, as in sovereign or private defaults a priority is to "treat" expeditiously trade lines of credits to allow for such credit to be restored and trade to flow again. It is not only a matter of urgency for essential imports to be financed, but also a pre-condition for economic recovery, as the resumption of trade is necessary for ailing countries to restore balance of payments equilibrium. The relatively favourable treatment received by trade finance was reflected in the moderate rate of capitalization for cross-border trade credit in the form of letters of credit and similar securitized instruments under the Basel I regulatory framework, put in place in the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, as the banking and regulatory communities moved towards internal-rating based and risk-weighted assets systems under the successor Basel II framework, a number of complaints emerged with respect to the treatment of trade credit – particularly in periods of crisis. Issues of pro-cyclicality, maturity structure and country risk have been discussed at some length in various fora, including in the WTO at the initiative of Members. Part of the issue was that Basel II regulation was designed and implemented in a manner that, in periods of banking retrenchment, seemed to have affected the supply of trade credit more than other potentially more risky forms of lending. With the collapse of trade in late 2008 and early 2009, the regulatory treatment of trade credit under Basel II clearly became an issue and was discussed by professional banking organizations, regulators and international financial institutions. A sentence made its headway into the communiqué of G-20 Leaders in London in April 2009, calling upon regulators to exercise some flexibility in the application of Basel II rules, in support of trade finance. As the issue of removing the obstacles to the supply of trade finance spread became part of the public debate, discussions with respect to the regulatory treatment of trade finance in the context of the making of "Basel III" rules are now raising political attention. Part of the underlying problem regarding the design of regulation of trade finance is that banking regulators may not have enough understanding of the way that trade and trade finance operate in practice. In turn, the banking community has made insufficient progress in explaining these issues to regulators and in providing evidence about the high level of safety and soundness of their activity, in collecting statistical information and even in defining clearly what comprises trade finance. This paper aims at clarifying such issues.  The WTO, in its role as an "honest broker", is trying to help the parties concerned, and has been asked from time to time to act as a go-between between the two communities, in order to clarify issues. Section 1 looks at the overall Basel framework and its evolution over time, with particular emphasis on the regulation of trade finance. Section 2 looks at issues raised in the WTO context by the trading and trade finance communities, be it by WTO Members or by experts, and how this has helped to clarify some of the disputed issues. Section 3 raises a number of questions which need clarification from the trade finance community for regulators to be able to better capture the reality of trade finance operations, and allow them to regulate with full understanding of its implications.

本文探讨了国际贸易信贷处理中的若干议题，包括事前（银行监管机构的处理方式）和事后（违约情况下债务人与债权人的处理方式），这些议题当前备受贸易金融界关注，尤其是传统贸易信贷与担保提供方，如银行、出口信用机构、区域开发银行及多边机构。本文不涉及经合组织安排下官方保险出口信贷的监管这一具体问题，该问题未被纳入本次分析范围。. . 传统上，贸易金融在国家及国际监管机构以及国际金融机构处理贸易金融债权时享有优先待遇，理由是贸易金融被视为最安全、最具抵押性且能自我清偿的贸易融资形式之一。这种优待也反映了贸易的系统重要性——当主权国家或私营部门违约时，优先"处理"贸易信贷额度以恢复信贷流动和贸易往来，不仅关乎紧急必需品的进口融资，更是经济复苏的前提条件，因为贸易恢复是困境国家重建国际收支平衡的必要条件。. . 这种相对优待体现在1980年代末至1990年代初实施的巴塞尔I框架下，信用证等证券化跨境贸易信贷工具适用的适度资本充足率要求。但随着银行业与监管界转向巴塞尔II框架下的内部评级与风险加权资产体系，关于贸易信贷处理的质疑开始浮现——尤其在危机时期。周期性、期限结构与国家风险等问题已在包括WTO成员发起的多边论坛中被广泛讨论。. . 部分问题在于巴塞尔II监管的设计与实施方式，在银行收缩时期似乎对贸易信贷供给的冲击大于其他风险更高的贷款形式。随着2008年末至2009年初的贸易崩溃，巴塞尔II下贸易信贷的监管处理明显成为银行专业组织、监管机构与国际金融机构的讨论焦点。2009年4月G20伦敦峰会公报特别提出，呼吁监管机构在实施巴塞尔II规则时保持灵活性以支持贸易金融。. . 随着消除贸易金融供给障碍成为公共辩论议题，围绕"巴塞尔III"规则制定中贸易金融监管处理的讨论正引发政治关注。监管设计中的根本问题在于：银行监管者可能对贸易及贸易金融的实际运作机制理解不足；而银行业在向监管者解释这些问题、提供业务安全稳健的证据、收集统计数据乃至明确定义贸易金融范畴等方面进展有限。. . 本文旨在澄清这些问题。作为"诚实中间人"的WTO正努力协助相关方，并时常受邀充当两大群体间的沟通桥梁。第一章概述巴塞尔框架及其演变，重点分析贸易金融监管；第二章考察WTO框架内贸易界与金融界（包括成员方与专家）提出的问题，及其对争议焦点的澄清作用；第三章提出需要贸易金融界澄清的若干问题，以帮助监管者更准确把握行业实况，实现基于充分认知的监管决策。
