Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to study strategic trade policies under international process research and development (R&D) competition with or without market leaders for free trade and a subsidy regime and compare the effects of R&D subsidies and export subsidies on the equilibrium levels of firm profit and social welfare.Design/methodology – For the analysis, we use previous work by Haaland and Kind (2008) and construct a differentiated goods duopoly model, wherein two firms compete via quantity in a thirdcountry market for free trade and the subsidy regime. We consider simultaneous-move quantity competition when the two firms choose their quantities simultaneously and sequential-move quantity competition when they choose their quantities sequentially. The results are compared to those of Balboa, Daughety and Reinganum (2004), who studied export subsidies.Findings – The following are the findings. First, the results of firm preference orderings regarding firm position from Dowrick (1986) and Balboa, Daughety and Reinganum (2004) may not hold in our model when the firms’ strategies are strategic substitutes under free trade. Second, the preference rankings under Cournot competition for free trade and a subsidy regime are the same as those in the strategic trade policy of export subsidy. Third, except for the cases of too close substitutes and complements, the results of firm and government preferences regarding firm position are different from those of Balboa, Daughety and Reinganum (2004) in that Stackelberg leadership in a subsidy regime is advantageous when the goods are substitutes but is disadvantageous when the goods are complements. Moreover, the equilibrium level of firm profit is the highest in the Cournot-Nash play when the goods are substitutes in a subsidy regime. Fourth, except for the cases of too close substitutes and complements, the results of firms’ and their respective governments’ trade regime preferences are similar to those of Balboa, Daughety and Reinganum (2004) in that a Stackelberg leader firm and government prefer free trade if the goods are substitutes and prefer a subsidy regime if the goods are complements. Furthermore, a Stackelberg follower firm and government strongly prefer a subsidy regime to free trade.Originality/value – By analyzing the effects of R&D subsidies and export subsidies in international markets, we can find similarities and differences between them in international markets.

目的——本文旨在研究国际流程研发（R&D）竞争环境下，存在或不存在市场领导者时自由贸易与补贴制度下的战略贸易政策，并比较研发补贴与出口补贴对企业利润和社会福利均衡水平的影响。. . 设计/方法——基于Haaland和Kind（2008）的研究框架，我们构建了差异化产品双寡头模型，其中两家企业在第三国市场通过产量竞争，分别考察自由贸易与补贴制度。我们分析两种情形：当企业同时选择产量时的同步移动产量竞争（古诺竞争），以及当企业先后选择产量时的序贯移动产量竞争（斯塔克尔伯格竞争）。研究结果将与Balboa、Daughety和Reinganum（2004）关于出口补贴的经典研究进行对比。. . 研究发现——主要结论如下：第一，当自由贸易下企业策略呈战略替代关系时，Dowrick（1986）与Balboa等（2004）提出的企业位次偏好排序结论在本模型中可能不成立；第二，古诺竞争下自由贸易与补贴制度的偏好排序与出口补贴战略贸易政策的研究结果一致；第三，除产品替代性或互补性极强的情况外，本模型关于企业位次的企业偏好与政府偏好结果与Balboa等（2004）存在差异：当产品为替代品时，补贴制度下的斯塔克尔伯格领导者具有优势，而互补品情形下则处于劣势。此外在补贴制度中，替代品情境下企业利润均衡值在古诺-纳什博弈时达到最高；第四，除极端替代/互补情形外，企业及其政府对贸易制度的偏好与Balboa等（2004）相似：替代品时斯塔克尔伯格领导企业及政府倾向自由贸易，互补品时偏好补贴制度。而斯塔克尔伯格跟随企业及政府则强烈倾向补贴制度而非自由贸易。. . 创新点/价值——通过分析国际市场中研发补贴与出口补贴的效应，本研究揭示了二者在国际市场上的异同点。
