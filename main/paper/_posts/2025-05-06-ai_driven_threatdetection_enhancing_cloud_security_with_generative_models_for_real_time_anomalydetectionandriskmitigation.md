With the unsurpassed growth of cloud computing comes lots of security challenges that can be only solved by advanced threat detection solutions for safeguarding of sensible data and infrastructure. Traditional security system using rule-based intrusion detection and signaturebased threat monitoring can not prevent sophisticated cyber threats. As the generative AI models, VAEs, GANs, transformers and so on, they are also very powerful technology tools for real time anomaly detection & risk mitigation. These AI driven models lead to the ability of early identification and response to threat patterns of normal and malicious behavior dynamically learned. In this paper, we explore the role of AI in cloud security, advantages of this AI over traditional methods, best way of implementing this AI, advantages of security using this AI, and the challenges in implementing this AI in cloud security. However, even with AI, the threat detection is more effective, but still some of the problems with interpretability of the model, adversarial robustness, computational overhead and regulator conducted compliance remain still. Other research directions in future are also presented for strengthening AI enhanced cybersecurity frameworks.

随着云计算无可匹敌的发展，随之而来的是大量安全挑战，这些挑战只能通过先进的威胁检测解决方案来保护敏感数据和基础设施。传统的安全系统使用基于规则的入侵检测和基于签名的威胁监控，无法防范复杂的网络威胁。而生成式AI模型，如变分自编码器（VAE）、生成对抗网络（GAN）、Transformer等，同样是实时异常检测和风险缓解的强大技术工具。这些AI驱动模型能够动态学习正常和恶意行为的威胁模式，从而实现早期识别和响应。本文探讨了AI在云安全中的作用、相较于传统方法的优势、实施该AI的最佳方式、使用该AI的安全优势，以及在云安全中实施该AI所面临的挑战。然而，即便有了AI，威胁检测更为有效，但模型可解释性、对抗鲁棒性、计算开销和监管合规等问题依然存在。本文还提出了未来加强AI增强网络安全框架的其他研究方向。
