Processing trade contributed greatly to China’s economic growth. The total value of China’s processing trade was US $1.7 billion during the initial period of reform and opening up, and reached US $1.2 trillion in 2015. However, the proportion of processing trade in China’s trade volume has been gradually declining due to the restrictions on processing trade imposed in the 2000s, a decline in overseas demand since the global financial crisis, and increasing labor costs in China. Nevertheless, its proportion still constitutes about 30% of the total trade value of China, remaining important. In particular, the percentage of processing trade with Korea accounts for approximately 50%, playing a vital role in China’s total trade with Korea.This seeks to grasp the structural changes in the China-South Korea trade and regulatory environment over time, and describes the implication for policy carried by the analysis.

加工贸易对中国经济增长贡献巨大。改革开放初期，中国加工贸易总额仅为17亿美元，到2015年已攀升至1.2万亿美元。但由于2000年代对加工贸易实施的限制、全球金融危机后海外需求下降以及中国劳动力成本上升等因素，加工贸易在中国贸易总额中的占比逐渐下降。尽管如此，其占比仍保持在中国贸易总额的30%左右，地位依然重要。其中中韩加工贸易占比约达50%，在中韩双边贸易中发挥着关键作用。本研究旨在把握中韩贸易结构与监管环境的历时性变迁，并阐释分析结果对政策制定的启示。
