Korean Abstract:최근 선진국 주도로 WTO 체재 개혁이 구체적으로 논의되고 있다. 이러한 WTO 체제 개혁 이면에는 글로벌 가치사슬의 확산, 세계 무역의 급속한 디지털화, 포용적 무역의 확산 등 글로벌 통상환경의 변화에 적절히 대응하지 못하고 있다는 WTO 자체의 문제점도 있지만 이와 함께 중국을 겨냥하여 과잉생산을 유발하는 산어보조금 및 국영기업의 불공정 행위에 대해 WTO 규정으로 귲하려는 선진국들의 의도도 내포되어 있다. 이에 본 연구보고서는 우리나라 입장에서 WTO 체제 개혁 논의에 대한 의제별 협상대응방안과 함께 글로벌 통상환경의 변화를 고려한 중장기 다자통상정책의 새로운 방향을 제시하였다.English Abstract:The World Trade Organization (WTO), launched in 1995 as a successor of the GATT system, has ambitiously begun its first multilateral trade negotiation round, Doha Development Agenda (DDA) in 2001. Since then, notwithstanding with its great ambition, the DDA has failed to draw visible results for more than 17 years, and hence confidence in the WTO-centered multilateral trading system has been declining accordingly. Nevertheless, there are some of the accomplishments of the WTO. The liberalization of the commodity markets has expanded and deepened through the conclusions of plurilateral negotiations under the WTO such as the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) and the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), and rules in service and intellectual property rights have been set-out and established. As a result of these achievements, the volume of global commodity trade has increased by more than three times, and the market share of developing countries has also increased from 28% in 1995 to 43% in 2017. The expansion of the number of member states is another achievement of the WTO. Although such expansion may have increased the difficulties and complexity of decision making in the WTO, it is clear that the expansion of new business opportunities by successfully incorporating developing countries into the global economy and applying unified WTO rules and standards is an achievement of the WTO. Along with the strengthening of the dispute settlement system, the Agreement on Trade Facilitation (TFA) and its implementation are the greatest achievements of the WTO system. The Trade Facilitation Agreement is the first multilateral trade agreement concluded after the establishment of the WTO and the launch of the DDA negotiations, while the Information Technology Agreement and the Government Procurement Agreement are plurilateral agreements. Economically, it is expected of the increase in exports by more than $ 1 trillion, the creation of 20 million export-related jobs, and the increase in the world's GDP by about $ 960 billion due to the reduction of trade costs and the improvement of trade environment.The limitations and problems of the WTO system are as clear as these achievements. In particular, governance issues that have long been pointed out are such typical examples. Decisions in the WTO system are in fact made by consensus, and enlarging the number of Member States has become a decisive factor in hindering efficient decision-making in the WTO. Although The ‘Single Undertaking’ principle of concluding the agreement contributed to maintaining the consistency and stability of the multilateral trade system, it caused the problem of the rigidity of the WTO system at the same time. The dispute settlement procedure is also increasingly problematic. Recently, the dispute settlement implementation process is increasingly followed by the retaliation process. In such processes, the situation in which the complainant must observe the implementation failure of the defendant until the retaliation is approved is undermining the fairness of the WTO system. Not only that, the lack of safeguard measures in service trade and the limitations and problems of special and differential treatment for developing countries have been pointed out as major challenges related to the current WTO system. In addition to the challenges of the WTO system itself, the fact that the WTO does not adequately respond to the rapidly changing global trade environment is also a major problem of the current WTO system. The reason why the FTAs around the world in the 2000’s have rapidly expanded is the WTO multilateral system has failed to respond effectively to the new trading environment. Since the early 2000s, the Global Production Networks have rapidly spread out and the 'made in world' has become common due to such international division of production, and hence the set-out of new trading rules and further tariff concessions in accordance with such development has long been awaited. However, the progress of DDA has fallen far short of expectation due to the confrontation between developed and developing countries. As the global economic slowdown has been prolonged since the global financial crisis in 2008, countries around the world have strengthened their protectionist policies for their industries and jobs. Notwithstanding, the WTO failed to issue a proper prescription for them. WTO members have constantly bashed protectionism and stated the importance of strengthening multilateral trade system whenever there is opportunity, but this is only an empty declaration; non-tariff measures have steadily increased since the financial crisis and have not returned to pre-2008 levels.

世界贸易组织（WTO）作为关贸总协定体系的继承者于1995年成立，并于2001年雄心勃勃地启动了首轮多边贸易谈判——多哈发展议程（DDA）。尽管怀抱宏大愿景，但历经17年多谈判仍未取得显著成果，WTO为核心的多边贸易体系公信力随之持续下滑。不过WTO仍取得若干成就：通过《信息技术协定》《政府采购协定》等诸边谈判推动货物市场自由化向纵深发展，建立服务贸易与知识产权规则体系。全球货物贸易量由此增长逾三倍，发展中国家市场份额从1995年的28%提升至2017年的43%。成员规模扩大是另一项成就——虽然增加了决策复杂度，但将发展中国家成功纳入全球经济体系并适用统一规则，由此拓展的新商业机遇无疑是WTO的功绩。争端解决机制的强化与《贸易便利化协定》（TFA）的实施堪称WTO体系最显著成就。该协定是WTO成立暨DDA启动后达成的首份多边贸易协定（前述两项为诸边协定），预计将通过降低贸易成本、改善贸易环境带动出口增长超1万亿美元，创造2000万个出口相关岗位，推动全球GDP增长约9600亿美元。. . WTO体系的局限性与问题同样显而易见。长期受诟病的治理问题尤为典型：决策实际遵循协商一致原则，成员扩容已成为阻碍效率的关键因素。"一揽子承诺"原则虽维护了多边体系稳定性，却导致体制僵化。争端解决程序也日益凸显弊端——近期案件执行阶段频繁出现报复措施，申诉方须容忍被诉方拖延执行直至报复获批的情形损害了体系公正性。此外，服务贸易保障措施缺位、发展中国家特殊与差别待遇问题亦被列为现行体系主要挑战。除体制本身问题外，WTO未能有效应对快速变化的全球贸易环境亦是重大缺陷。2000年代区域自贸协定激增的根源，正是多边体系对新贸易环境的失能：全球生产网络扩张使"世界制造"成为常态，但发达与发展中国家对立导致DDA未能及时制定新规则、推进关税减让。2008年金融危机后全球经济持续低迷，各国强化产业与就业保护政策，WTO却未能提出有效解决方案。成员虽屡次空泛申明反对保护主义、强调多边体系重要性，但非关税措施持续增加至今未回落至危机前水平。

### **论文解读：WTO 체재 개혁과 한국의 다자통상정책 방향**  

#### **1. 研究目的**  
论文旨在分析WTO多边贸易体系的成就与局限性，探讨其改革方向，并提出韩国在多边贸易政策上的应对策略。核心关注点包括：  
- 评估WTO的历史贡献与当前困境；  
- 识别体制性缺陷（如决策效率、争端解决机制问题）；  
- 提出适应新贸易环境的改革建议，为韩国政策制定提供参考。  

#### **2. 研究方法**  
- **历史分析法**：梳理WTO自1995年成立以来的关键事件（如多哈回合谈判、诸边协定成果）；  
- **问题导向分析**：通过案例（如争端解决机制失效、区域自贸协定激增）揭示体制矛盾；  
- **数据支撑**：引用贸易量、市场份额等量化指标佐证观点。  

#### **3. 核心观点**  
- **成就**：  
  - 推动全球货物贸易量增长3倍，发展中国家市场份额显著提升（28%→43%）；  
  - 通过《信息技术协定》《贸易便利化协定》（TFA）等实现局部自由化，TFA预计带动全球出口增长1万亿美元；  
  - 争端解决机制曾强化规则约束力，发展中国家纳入统一规则体系。  
- **局限性**：  
  - **治理低效**：协商一致原则和成员扩容导致决策僵化；  
  - **规则滞后**：未能应对全球生产网络（如“世界制造”）和新贸易壁垒（如非关税措施）；  
  - **执行缺陷**：争端解决程序冗长，报复措施损害公正性；  
  - **发展议题分歧**：发达国家与发展中国家在特殊待遇、服务贸易规则上对立。  

#### **4. 创新点**  
- **系统性归因分析**：将WTO困境归为“体制设计”与“环境适应”双重问题，而非单纯成员分歧；  
- **政策联动视角**：指出区域自贸协定激增是WTO功能缺位的直接结果，需通过改革弥合多边与区域机制；  
- **韩国政策建议**：主张韩国应平衡多边与区域策略，推动WTO改革（如灵活决策机制、更新数字贸易规则）。  

#### **5. 潜在影响**  
- **理论层面**：为多边贸易体系改革提供结构化分析框架，强调规则灵活性与包容性；  
- **实践层面**：  
  - 对韩国：建议其利用中等强国地位，在数字经济、服务业等领域主导规则制定；  
  - 对WTO：呼吁优化协商一致原则，引入“临界数量”模式（如诸边协定）提升效率；  
  - 对全球贸易：若改革停滞，区域化趋势可能进一步削弱多边体系权威性。  

### **总结**  
论文通过实证与问题分析，指出WTO需在决策机制、规则更新、执行效率等方面改革，而韩国应通过多边与区域政策协同，在变革中争取话语权。研究为理解WTO困境及未来方向提供了清晰路径。
