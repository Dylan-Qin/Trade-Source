This article analyzes the main content involved in the risk assessment of industrial control system secure integrated, covering two parts,they are standard system and technical system.Firstly, the introduction explains the importance, connotation, and principles of risk assessment; Then, from the perspectives of safety risk assessment,security risk assessment, and secure integrated risk assessment, the existing international and national standards are highly condensed and summarized,and the risk assessment processes of different standards are summarized.The key is to summarize and analyze typical risk assessment methods from different perspectives.Risk propagation as an important part of risk assessment, it includes the study of risk propagation paths and mechanisms. Based on this, we explore integrated risk assessment methods and look forward to the future prospects of secure integrated risk assessment.

本文分析了工业控制系统安全一体化风险评估涉及的主要内容，涵盖标准体系和技术体系两部分。首先，引言阐述了风险评估的重要性、内涵及原则；随后从安全风险评估、信息安全风险评估以及安全一体化风险评估三个角度，对现有国际和国家标准进行了高度凝练与总结，归纳了不同标准下的风险评估流程。重点是从不同视角总结分析了典型的风险评估方法。风险传播作为风险评估的重要组成部分，包括对风险传播路径和机制的研究。在此基础上，我们探索了一体化风险评估方法，并展望了安全一体化风险评估的未来前景。
