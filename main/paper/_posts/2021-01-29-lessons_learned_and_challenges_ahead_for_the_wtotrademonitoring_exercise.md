The paper introduces the WTO Trade Monitoring exercise and shows how the idea and the principles behind the current Trade Monitoring effort have much earlier origins than the financial crisis. It also provides an overview of selected trends and developments identified by the monitoring exercise since 2009 and focuses on recent developments in the global trading environment, including the effects of the increasingly protectionist rhetoric which has characterized much of the debate on trade over the past couple of years. Finally, the paper addresses the challenges facing the WTO monitoring exercise, and the way forward after ten years of existence.

本文介绍了世贸组织的贸易监督机制，并揭示当前贸易监督工作背后的理念和原则其实远早于金融危机时期。文章概述了2009年以来监督机制识别出的若干重要趋势与发展动态，重点关注全球贸易环境的最新变化，包括过去两年贸易讨论中日益凸显的保护主义言论所产生的影响。最后，论文探讨了世贸组织贸易监督机制面临的挑战，以及这项运行十年的机制未来发展方向。
