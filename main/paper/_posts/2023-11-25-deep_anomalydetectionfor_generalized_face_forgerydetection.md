Nowadays, the face forgery causes great threat to societal security, hence it is of paramount importance to develop effective countermeasures against it. Though most existing methods adopt neural networks to automatically extract discriminative features for forgery detection and have achieved good results on uncompressed videos, there are still unignorable problems. Namely, when detecting forgery faces generated by unknown forgery methods, the detection performance decreases seriously, which means the generalization capability is poor. To compensate for such limitations, a novel deep anomaly detection for generalized face forgery detection (DAGFD) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the residual artifact map generator optimized by triplet focal loss and metric-softmax loss is first used to locate the fake regions of the compressed videos and amplify the semantic features of the forgery videos. Next, forgery detection is reformulated from the anomaly detection perspective, and the artifact map score is calculated to detect forgery videos. Furthermore, mean square error (MSE) loss is used to minimize the artifact map score of real samples while increase the one of forgery samples to generalize well to unseen forgery methods. Also, circle loss is used for auxiliary classifier to learn more discriminative artifact features. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method’s detection accuracy is better than other state-of-the-art methods.

当前，人脸伪造技术对社会安全构成重大威胁，因此开发有效的应对措施至关重要。尽管现有方法多采用神经网络自动提取区分性特征进行伪造检测，并在未压缩视频上取得良好效果，但仍存在不可忽视的问题：当检测未知伪造方法生成的人脸时，检测性能显著下降，表明其泛化能力不足。为弥补这一缺陷，本文提出了一种新型深度异常检测方法——广义人脸伪造检测框架（DAGFD）。具体而言，首先利用由三元组焦点损失和度量-softmax损失优化的残差伪影图生成器，定位压缩视频的伪造区域并放大伪造视频的语义特征；其次从异常检测角度重构伪造检测任务，通过计算伪影图得分实现伪造视频识别；进一步采用均方误差（MSE）损失最小化真实样本的伪影图得分，同时提升伪造样本得分，以增强对未知伪造方法的泛化能力；此外引入圆形损失辅助分类器学习更具判别力的伪影特征。实验结果表明，所提方法的检测精度优于其他先进技术。
