I investigate sovereign risk management using expected utility theory. A proposition is derived under which conditions which degree of hedging is optimal. An application to the case of Russia shows that a risk-acceptant attitude can serve as an explanation of the decisions to bail out Rosneft and to leave some oil exposure unhedged.

我运用期望效用理论研究主权风险管理。通过推导得出一个命题，阐明了在何种条件下何种程度的对冲是最优的。以俄罗斯为例的应用表明，风险偏好的态度可以解释其决定救助俄罗斯石油公司以及保留部分石油风险敞口不进行对冲的行为。
