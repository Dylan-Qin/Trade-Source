We take up the question of potential conflicts between the objectives of risk management policies and those connected with maximization of the firm's value. This question is a timely one, since many firms have a special committee devoted to risk management - banks and insurance companies in particular. In the wake of the Enron affair, various proposals have been formulated regarding the composition of the different committees set up by boards of directors. In the financial literature, it is now a widely accepted fact that risk management issues can give rise to conflicts of interest between heads of firms and shareholders, notably when executives are remunerated in stock options. In our opinion, the board's risk management committee must be composed of competent and independent directors who hold no options to purchase the firm's shares.

我们探讨风险管理政策目标与公司价值最大化目标之间可能存在的冲突问题。这一问题具有现实意义，因为许多企业（尤其是银行和保险公司）都设立了专门的风险管理委员会。安然事件后，针对董事会下设各委员会的组成已提出了多种改革方案。金融学界现已普遍认同：当高管薪酬采用股票期权形式时，风险管理问题可能导致企业负责人与股东之间的利益冲突。我们认为，董事会风险管理委员会必须由不持有公司股票期权的、具备专业能力且保持独立性的董事组成。
