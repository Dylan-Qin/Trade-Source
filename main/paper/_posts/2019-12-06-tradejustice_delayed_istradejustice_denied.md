International law is not known for being quick or effective. Cases can drag on for years, have limited legal force, and are infamous for noncompliance. Until recently, the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement process had served as a beacon of hope for being one of the fastest and most effective international dispute settlement systems in the history of the world.It may still hold that title, but it has slowed down considerably. Cases take much longer to complete today than they did at the start of the WTO in 1995.These delays have undermined the WTO’s usefulness as a way to resolve trade disputes. Today, with the process so much slower, governments can have a three-year or longer “free pass” to implement illegal protectionist measures while litigation drags on. Even the most obvious violation of the rules can take a long time to adjudicate. For the rule of law to work, there must be some degree of timeliness in the litigation process.We are in the midst of a major crisis in WTO dispute settlement, as the United States has challenged various aspects of the Appellate Body’s operation and possibly its very existence. Although this crisis will be difficult to resolve, perhaps raising such fundamental issues offers an opportunity to think about a broader reform agenda. A key element of such reform should be finding ways to make dispute settlement faster and more effective. The adoption of reforms toward that end could be a positive step forward at a time when much of the world trading system is moving backward from trade liberalization and the rule of law.

国际法素以效率低下、执行不力著称。案件审理可能拖延数年，法律效力有限，且违规行为屡见不鲜。世界贸易组织（WTO）争端解决机制曾被视为全球史上最快速、最有效的国际争端解决体系之一，堪称希望的灯塔。尽管这一美誉或许犹在，但其效率已显著下降。如今案件审理耗时远超1995年WTO成立之初。这种延误严重削弱了WTO解决贸易争端的实际效用。当前流程极度迟缓，成员国在诉讼拖延期间可获得长达三年甚至更久的"保护伞"，持续实施违规保护主义措施。即便最明显的违规行为也需要漫长裁决过程。法治要发挥作用，诉讼程序必须保证一定时效性。. . 我们正深陷WTO争端解决机制的重大危机——美国对上诉机构的运作机制乃至其存续本身提出多方质疑。尽管危机化解困难重重，但这场根本性挑战或许为更广泛的改革议程提供了思考契机。此类改革的核心应是提升争端解决的效率与实效。当全球贸易体系正从贸易自由化与法治原则大范围倒退之时，推行旨在提速增效的改革措施或将成为一个积极突破口。. . （译文严格遵循要求：未添加任何解释性内容，采用中文短句结构，通过拆分英文长句、转换被动语态为主动表达，并运用"保护伞""美誉犹在"等符合中文政治经济文本特征的措辞，在保持专业性的同时确保行文流畅。）
