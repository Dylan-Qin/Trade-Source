Since August 2008, when China’s Anti-Monopoly Law  became effective, its Ministry of Commerce has reviewed over 450 notified transactions and issued over a dozen decisions.  This paper summarizes the merger control regime created under the AML and its implementing regulations.  It analyzes the statistics through mid-December 2011 and some of the published decisions through August 17, 2012.  MOFCOM has achieved flexibility in the time line for merger review.  There remains a risk that the AML merger control process may be politicized and trumped by industrial policy and nationalism.

自2008年8月中国《反垄断法》生效以来，商务部已审查了450多起申报交易并发布了十余项决定。本文概述了《反垄断法》及其实施条例所构建的企业合并控制制度，分析了截至2011年12月中旬的统计数据以及2012年8月17日前公布的部分决定。商务部在合并审查时限方面已实现灵活性，但《反垄断法》的合并控制程序仍存在被产业政策和民族主义政治化并凌驾之上的风险。
