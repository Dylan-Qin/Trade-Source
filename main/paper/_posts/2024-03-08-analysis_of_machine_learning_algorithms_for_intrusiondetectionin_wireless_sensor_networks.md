A wireless sensor network faces significant power and security issues that are incompatible. As the complexity of security increases, the use of batteries will also increase. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have limited power, and their structure is continuously changing, so attempts to depend on the security of widely used methods like cryptography are the research highlights; the necessity for flexible and reliable intrusion detection techniques while illuminating the numerous forms of assault that risk the integrity and confidentiality of wireless sensor net- works. Machine learning (ML) method utilization is the primary concern of this review paper to enhance intrusion detection in WSNs. This paper highlights the incorporation of ML for WSNs by carrying out a comprehensive literature review of the advancements made in the areas of attack identification, and intrusion detection. The review offers insights into the applicability of various ML approaches for different attack scenarios and intrusion detection by examining the advantages and disadvantages of each methodology. By blending monitoring and decision intelligence, machine learning algorithms are among the suggested strategies for delivering services for this kind of network’s security.

无线传感器网络面临着显著且相互矛盾的功耗与安全问题。随着安全复杂性的提升，电池消耗也会相应增加。无线传感器网络（WSN）具有能量受限的特性，且其结构持续动态变化，因此如何依托密码学等广泛使用的安全方法成为研究重点；在阐明威胁无线传感器网络完整性与机密性的多种攻击形式的同时，亟需开发灵活可靠的入侵检测技术。本综述论文聚焦机器学习（ML）方法在增强WSN入侵检测中的应用，通过系统梳理攻击识别和入侵检测领域的研究进展，重点探讨了机器学习与WSN的融合。该综述通过评估各类方法的优缺点，深入剖析了不同机器学习技术针对多样化攻击场景及入侵检测的适用性。通过融合监测与决策智能，机器学习算法被视为保障此类网络安全服务的推荐策略之一。
