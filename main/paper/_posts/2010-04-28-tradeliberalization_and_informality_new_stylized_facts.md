The relationship between trade liberalization and informal activity has not received the attention, whether theoretical or empirical, that it may deserve. The conventional view posits that trade liberalization would cause a rise in informality. This paper uses three different data sets to assess the sign of the relationship. Empirical results provide a mixed picture. Macro-founded data tend to produce results supporting the conventional view; micro-founded data do not. Empirical results also suggest that while informal output increases with deeper trade liberalization, informal employment falls.

贸易自由化与非正规活动之间的关系尚未获得其应得的理论或实证关注。传统观点认为，贸易自由化会导致非正规经济扩张。本文通过三组不同数据集来评估两者关系的方向性。实证结果呈现矛盾态势：宏观基础数据倾向于支持传统观点，而微观基础数据则得出相反结论。研究还表明，尽管贸易自由化程度加深会促使非正规产出增加，但非正规就业却呈现下降趋势。
