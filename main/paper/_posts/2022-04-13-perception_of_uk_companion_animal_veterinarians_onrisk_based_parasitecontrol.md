Parasites can pose a risk to companion animals and potentially their owners. Current parasiticide use is possibly impacting the environment, increasing adverse reaction and resistance risk. As such parasiticides should be dispensed by the veterinary team proportional to individual risk, including owners in their approach. A mixed-methods questionnaire was designed and distributed using snowball sampling to ascertain overall understanding, observance, and attitude towards utilising a risk-based approach to parasite prophylaxis by UK companion animal veterinarians. 85.71% of veterinarians surveyed reported that they broadly understood risk-based parasite control whereas only 53.92% said they utilise it always or often. Significant correlations were found between more frequent risk-based parasite control utilisation and increased owner involvement (p<= 0.0007) and prescription confidence (p= 0.0001). Most attitudes towards adopting risk-based control were positive. There was significant association with positive attitude and greater utilisation frequency (p= 0.0010), as well as working in corporate practice (p= 0.0126). Understanding risk-based parasite control has potential to increase responsible utilisation of parasiticides by veterinarians, and therefore mitigate risks associated. Most veterinarians would like to see the profession move towards risk-based control use, but institutional changes are required. Further research, and education is also needed.

寄生虫可能对伴侣动物及其主人构成威胁。当前驱虫药的使用可能正在影响环境，增加不良反应和耐药性风险。因此，兽医团队应根据个体风险（包括主人因素）按比例分配驱虫药。本研究采用混合方法问卷设计，通过滚雪球抽样分发，以评估英国伴侣动物兽医对基于风险的寄生虫预防方法的整体理解、实践情况及态度。85.71%的受访兽医表示基本理解基于风险的寄生虫防控，但仅53.92%表示总是或经常采用该方法。研究发现，更频繁采用基于风险防控与加强主人参与度（p≤0.0007）及处方信心（p=0.0001）存在显著相关性。多数兽医对采用该防控方法持积极态度，积极态度与更高使用频率（p=0.0010）及在连锁诊所工作（p=0.0126）显著相关。理解基于风险的防控有望促进兽医更负责任地使用驱虫药，从而降低相关风险。多数兽医希望行业转向基于风险的防控，但需进行制度性变革，同时需要进一步研究和教育支持。
