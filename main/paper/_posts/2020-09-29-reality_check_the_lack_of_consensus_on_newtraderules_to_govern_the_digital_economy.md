This article makes three arguments. First, that beyond a very narrow set of largely uncontroversial disciplines on domestic legislative reforms to facilitate or promote e-commerce and cooperate in this area, it has proven and will likely continue to prove extremely difficult to establish anything but the most superficial consensus with respect to meaningful new trade rules to govern the digital economy. Second, it argues that with respect to a second set of rules that seek to establish genuine and enforceable constraints to governments’ ability to effect harmful regulatory interventions in the digital economy, the textual outcomes that have emerged so far in trade agreements such as the CPTPP are so riddled with broadly formulated exceptions and carve-outs, that there is little prospect for business to obtain the predictability and certainty that these new rules should ideally promise. Finally, this article argues that a set of exogenous factors has conspired to make the need to establish consensus on new trade rules to govern the digital economy more urgent but also infinitely more difficult, including but not limited to a backlash against technology the rise in income inequality in advanced industrialized countries, a resurgence in protectionism, and an America no longer willing to show constructive leadership that threatens to permanently cripple the rules based multilateral trading system.

本文提出三个论点。首先，除了一系列极为有限且基本无争议的国内立法改革措施——这些措施旨在促进电子商务及该领域合作——事实证明，过去和未来都极难就数字经济治理方面有实质意义的新贸易规则达成任何超越表面共识的协议。其次，本文认为对于第二类规则——即试图真正且可执行地限制政府对数字经济实施有害监管干预的能力——目前《全面与进步跨太平洋伙伴关系协定》等贸易协定中形成的文本成果充斥着宽泛表述的例外条款和豁免规定，企业几乎无法通过这些新规则获得理论上应提供的可预测性和确定性。最后，本文指出一系列外部因素共同作用，使得就数字经济新贸易规则达成共识的需求变得更加紧迫，同时也无限复杂化。这些因素包括但不限于：对技术反弹的浪潮、发达工业化国家收入不平等的加剧、保护主义抬头，以及美国不再愿意展现建设性领导力——这种态势可能永久性破坏基于规则的多边贸易体系。
