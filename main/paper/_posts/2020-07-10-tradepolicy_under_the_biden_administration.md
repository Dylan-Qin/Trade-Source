The past several years have been tumultuous ones for U.S. trade policy. After strident rhetoric from Donald Trump during his presidential campaign, his administration followed up with a wide range of aggressive actions. Congress, U.S. trading partners, businesses, and consumers have all been pushed to their limits by an administration that has taken U.S. policy in a protectionist and unilateral direction.If Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden wins the 2020 election, he will face the challenge of developing a coherent U.S. trade policy that provides stability and certainty. This paper presents an overview of the trade issues a President Joe Biden would likely face, with some suggestions on possible approaches his administration might take. It covers seven major topics, with some overlap among them:Trade agreements: What should U.S. trade agreements say, and with whom should the United States negotiate them?The World Trade Organization (WTO): How should a Biden administration deal with the many challenges faced by the multilateral trade institution that is the foundation of the trading system?China: How should a Biden administration approach China’s controversial and difficult integration into the trading system?The United States‐​Mexico‐​Canada Agreement (USMCA): Can some of the USMCA’s flaws be fixed during implementation?Executive trade actions: How should a Biden administration use executive branch discretion over trade policy?The role of Congress: Is it time to recalibrate the legislative/​executive balance of power over trade?Personnel: Who should be in charge of U.S. trade policy?

过去几年对美国贸易政策而言可谓动荡不安。唐纳德·特朗普在总统竞选期间发表激烈言论后，其政府随后采取了一系列强硬行动。这个将美国政策推向保护主义和单边主义的政府，已将国会、美国贸易伙伴、企业和消费者逼至极限。如果民主党总统候选人乔·拜登赢得2020年大选，他将面临制定连贯贸易政策的挑战——这项政策需要提供稳定性和确定性。本文概述了拜登总统可能面临的贸易议题，并对其政府可采取的策略提出建议，涵盖以下七个相互关联的重点领域：  . . **贸易协定**：美国贸易协定应包含哪些内容？应与哪些国家进行谈判？  . **世界贸易组织（WTO）**：拜登政府应如何应对这个贸易体系基石所面临的多重挑战？  . **中国议题**：拜登政府该如何处理中国融入贸易体系引发的争议与难题？  . **美墨加协定（USMCA）**：能否在实施过程中修正该协定的部分缺陷？  . **行政贸易措施**：拜登政府应如何运用行政部门对贸易政策的裁量权？  . **国会角色**：是否应重新调整立法与行政分支在贸易事务上的权力平衡？  . **人事安排**：谁应主导美国贸易政策？
