Trade can be a powerful engine for economic growth, poverty reduction, and development. However, harnessing the power of trade is often difficult for developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, because of supply-side domestic constraints (lack of trade-related infrastructure and capacity). The Aid for Trade Initiative was launched to address these constraints. This paper sets forth strategies to identify the most binding constraints to trade expansion so countries and donors can channel resources toward reforms and projects that have the largest effect. It shows that the four most common objectives of aid-for-trade projects (increasing trade, diversifying exports, maximizing the linkages with the domestic economy, and increasing adjustment capacity) have the potential to boost growth and reduce poverty in developing countries. However, the potential of trade may not be realized as developing countries often face binding constraints that prevent them from turning trade opportunities into trade, and trade into growth. First, they face difficulties turning trade opportunities into trade flows because of capacity constraints and lack of adequate trade-related infrastructure. Second, some domestic constraints choke the impact of trade expansion on economic growth. The paper focuses on the first set of constraints and presents various diagnostic tools available to identify them. These tools often pinpoint a long list of constraints. As all constraints cannot be addressed simultaneously, there is a need to identify the most binding ones in order to prioritize reforms. The paper suggests combining the different diagnostic tools in an appropriate framework to achieve this prioritization. An adaptation of the growth diagnostics can be such a framework. By shifting the focus from growth to trade, this framework can be readily adapted by local authorities and development practitioners.

贸易可以成为经济增长、减贫和发展的强大引擎。然而，发展中国家尤其是最不发达国家由于供给侧国内制约因素（缺乏与贸易相关的基础设施和能力），往往难以发挥贸易的推动作用。"贸易援助倡议"正是为应对这些制约因素而启动。本文提出了一系列识别贸易扩张最紧迫制约因素的策略，以便各国和捐助方将资源投向能产生最大效果的改革和项目。研究表明，贸易援助项目最常见的四大目标（扩大贸易规模、促进出口多元化、最大化与国内经济的联动效应、提升调整适应能力）有望推动发展中国家经济增长并减少贫困。但贸易潜力可能无法充分释放，因为这些国家常面临刚性约束，使其难以将贸易机遇转化为实际贸易活动，再将贸易转化为经济增长。首先，受能力限制和贸易基础设施不足影响，他们难以将贸易机会转变为贸易流量；其次，部分国内制约因素削弱了贸易扩张对经济增长的促进作用。本文重点探讨第一类制约因素，介绍了多种可用于识别这些问题的诊断工具。这些工具通常会列出一长串制约因素，由于无法同时解决所有问题，必须识别最关键的制约因素以确定改革优先级。文章建议在适当框架内综合运用不同诊断工具来实现优先排序，调整后的"增长诊断法"可作为此类框架。通过将关注点从增长转向贸易，该框架能方便地被当地政府和发展实践者采用。
