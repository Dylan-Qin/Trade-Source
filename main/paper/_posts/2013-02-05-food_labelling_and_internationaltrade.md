National food labelling legislation dealing with matters such as health claims nutritional content and safety warnings are governed by a complex of international agreements the most important of which are the the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS). This article examines the food labelling jurisprudence which has been developed by the recent decisions of the WTO dispute panels and Appeal Body. It seeks to locate this jurisprudence within the complex of other international instruments such as the Cartagena Biosafety Protocol as well as the GATT and the TRIP Agreements.

国家食品标签法规涉及健康声明、营养成分和安全警示等事项，这些法规受一系列国际协定的约束，其中最重要的是世界贸易组织的《技术性贸易壁垒协定》（TBT）和《实施卫生与植物卫生措施协定》（SPS）。本文探讨了世贸组织争端解决小组和上诉机构近期裁决所形成的食品标签判例体系，并试图将这些判例置于《卡塔赫纳生物安全议定书》、《关税与贸易总协定》（GATT）及《与贸易有关的知识产权协定》（TRIPS）等其他国际法律文书的框架中进行定位。
