This paper examines how services trade and policies contribute to connectivity. It highlights the economic relevance of services and identifies some key channels through which trade in services contributes to physical and digital connectivity. The paper examines the impact of services trade policies on connectivity in view of recent research showing their impact on sectoral performance, economic welfare and development. Finally, it discusses the positive contribution that aid for trade can make in support of services policies. The paper finds that services sectors play a multifaceted and significant role in connecting countries to the international trading system, and matter greatly to economic development and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Services significantly affect connectivity by: (i) providing the basic infrastructure to support trade in goods; (ii) facilitating supply chains and entering trade as value added embodied in goods; (iii) providing the backbone that enables e-commerce and the on-line supply of services; (iv) and enhancing export diversification through their cross-border electronic supply. The paper underscores that services trade policies have a fundamental impact on connectivity. Restrictions to investment and cross-border trade in services remain high and widespread. But an enabling policy environment – promoting competition, openness to trade and investment, and adequate regulatory frameworks – can enhance connectivity, lower trade costs, and foster growth and economic performance. For example, improving the policy environment for services sectors can help attract the FDI required to meet the SDGs and develop the ICT infrastructure needed to bridge the digital divide. Aid for Trade can play a supportive role in this regard.

本文探讨了服务贸易及其政策如何促进互联互通。文章重点分析了服务的经济重要性，并指出了服务贸易促进实体与数字互联互通的若干关键渠道。基于近期研究表明服务贸易政策对行业表现、经济福利及发展具有重要影响，本文研究了这类政策对互联互通的作用。最后，文章讨论了贸易援助对服务政策的积极支持作用。研究发现：服务业在连接各国与国际贸易体系方面发挥着多层面重要作用，对经济发展和实现可持续发展目标（SDGs）至关重要。服务业通过以下方式显著影响互联互通：（一）提供支撑货物贸易的基础设施；（二）促进供应链发展并以商品内含增值形式参与贸易；（三）构建支持电子商务和在线服务供给的技术骨架；（四）通过跨境电子化供应推动出口多元化。研究强调，服务贸易政策对互联互通具有根本性影响。目前对服务业投资和跨境贸易的限制仍普遍存在且程度较高，但营造有利的政策环境——促进竞争、开放贸易投资、完善监管框架——能够增强互联互通、降低贸易成本并提振经济增长表现。例如，改善服务业政策环境有助于吸引实现SDGs所需的外国直接投资，并发展弥合数字鸿沟所需的信息通信技术基础设施。贸易援助可在此领域发挥重要支持作用。
