This paper provides the first-ever survey of the implications of violent conflict risk for planetary defense program decisions. Arguably, the aim of planetary defense should be to make Earth safer from all threats, including but not limited to threats from near-Earth objects (NEOs). Insofar as planetary defense projects affect other risks besides NEOs, these other risks should be taken into account. This paper evaluates three potential effects of planetary defense programs on violent conflict risk. First, planetary defense may offer a constructive model for addressing a major global risk. By documenting the history of its successes and failures, the planetary defense community can aid efforts to address other global risks, including but not limited to violent conflict. Second, the proposed use of nuclear explosions for NEO deflection and disruption could affect the role of nuclear weapons in violent conflict risk. The effect may be such that nuclear deflection/disruption would increase aggregate risks to human society. However, the effect is difficult to assess, mainly due to ambiguities in violent conflict risk. Third, planetary defense could reduce violent conflict risk by addressing the possibility of NEO collisions being mistaken as violent attacks and inadvertently triggering violent conflict. False alarms mistaken as real attacks are a major concern, especially as a cause of nuclear war. Improved awareness of NEOs and communication between astronomers and military officials could help resolve NEO false alarms. Each of these three effects of planetary defense programs on violent conflict risk can benefit from interaction between the communities that study and address NEO and violent conflict risks.

本文首次探讨了暴力冲突风险对行星防御项目决策的影响。可以说，行星防御的目标应是使地球免受所有威胁，包括但不限于近地天体（NEOs）的威胁。既然行星防御项目会影响近地天体以外的其他风险，这些风险也应纳入考量。本文评估了行星防御项目对暴力冲突风险的三种潜在影响：首先，行星防御可为应对重大全球风险提供建设性范例。通过记录其成功与失败的历史，行星防御界有助于应对包括暴力冲突在内的其他全球风险。其次，利用核爆炸偏转或摧毁近地天体的提议可能影响核武器在暴力冲突风险中的作用。这种影响可能导致核偏转/摧毁技术增加人类社会的整体风险，但由于暴力冲突风险存在诸多不确定性，该影响难以评估。第三，行星防御可通过消除近地天体碰撞被误判为暴力攻击的可能性，从而降低意外引发暴力冲突的风险。将虚假警报误认为真实攻击是重大隐患，尤其是可能引发核战争。提高对近地天体的认知并加强天文学家与军事官员间的沟通，有助于化解近地天体误报危机。研究近地天体风险与暴力冲突风险的群体相互交流，将有助于优化上述三种影响。
