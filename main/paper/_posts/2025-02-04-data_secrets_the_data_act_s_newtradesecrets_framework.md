The recently adopted Data Act (DA) creates a complex system of data access, (re-)use and portability rights whose deeper implications are yet to be fully unpacked. Underpinning this sweeping intervention in data transactions is a general desire by the EU legislator to preserve and foster a competitive data market, favour fairness in data contracts, allow users of Internet of Things (IoT) products to have access to their co-generated data, and to empower public sector bodies, in certain special situations, to access privately held datasets. These are ambitious policy objectives that align well with the European Commission’s Data Strategy.Naturally, as in every complex legal intervention aimed at regulating multifaceted dynamics, rules and rights are accompanied by exceptions and carve-outs. Trade secrets (TS), given their ability to cover situations that may escape the scope of (other) intellectual property rights, have attained a very distinctive place in the DA’s architecture. Not only TS feature quite prominently as a tool to mitigate and, one might say, undermine, some of the data access and sharing obligations of the DA. They are also the recipients of a very specific and unique set of regulatory interventions, including a duty to notify a competent authority which will be tasked with what can be arguably viewed as a prima-facie validity assessment of the trade secret claim. Furthermore, specific rules on technical protection measures could arguably equip TS with remedies that go beyond the traditional limits of this category. These two innovations are central to the present analysis and will be assessed in relation to the two specific data sharing regimes within which they are developed: Internet of Things (IoT) and Business-to-Government (B2G) data sharing obligations.This paper, while building on previous scholar analysis, focuses specifically on information that has the simultaneous legal status of data and trade secret. It centres on the potentially conflicting obligations to protect, yet to share, such information as well as on the interfaces developed in the DA to address this conflict. It argues that the EU legislator may have effectively created a new (sub)category of TS, governed by their own subset of rules and procedures found in the DA, for those cases where TS are embedded in IoT or B2G data sharing obligations. The paper refers to this new category as data secrets. The analysis proceeds as follows: Section 2 examines the foundational principles and objectives underpinning the DA and the EU Trade Secrets Directive (TSD), identifying key challenges in uniting these separate approaches. Section 3 examines how the DA addresses TS protection while pursuing greater data access by focusing on the specific regimes for IoT and B2G data sharing. Section 4 highlights two key novel characteristics of data secrets that are relatively foreign to conventional notions of trade secrecy. The first is the decision-making powers of competent authorities as intermediate bodies in confirming trade secrecy. The second is the central role of technical protection measures as technological means for achieving trade secrecy and potentially expanding its effects. Section 5 concludes that data secrets manifestly supplement existing legal structures for trade secret protection in the EU data economy, but in doing so open up a number of theoretical and interpretative questions that seek proper systematization.

新近通过的《数据法案》（DA）构建了一套复杂的数据访问、（再）使用与可携权体系，其深层影响尚待全面解析。欧盟立法者对此番数据交易全面干预的核心诉求在于：维护并培育竞争性数据市场、促进数据合同公平性、确保物联网（IoT）产品用户获取其协同生成的数据，以及在特定特殊情形下授权公共部门获取私有数据集。这些雄心勃勃的政策目标与欧盟委员会《数据战略》高度契合。. . 如同所有旨在规范多维动态的复杂法律干预，该法案的权利规则亦伴随例外与豁免条款。鉴于商业秘密（TS）能够覆盖其他知识产权无法触及的情形，其在《数据法案》架构中获得了独特地位——不仅作为关键工具显著缓解（甚至可理解为削弱）部分数据访问与共享义务，更成为一系列特殊监管措施的适用对象，包括需向主管机构申报的义务（该机构将承担对商业秘密主张的表面有效性评估职责）。此外，关于技术保护措施的专门规则可能突破传统商业秘密救济边界。这两项创新构成本文分析核心，将结合其适用的两大具体数据共享机制——物联网（IoT）与企业对政府（B2G）数据共享义务——进行评估。. . 本文在既有学术研究基础上，聚焦同时具备数据与商业秘密双重法律属性的信息，重点探讨保护与共享此类信息的潜在义务冲突，以及《数据法案》为解决冲突设计的衔接机制。本文主张：当商业秘密嵌入物联网或B2G数据共享义务时，欧盟立法者可能已实质创设了受《数据法案》专门规则程序管辖的新（子）类别商业秘密。本文将之命名为"数据秘密"。. . 具体分析路径如下：第二节考察《数据法案》与《欧盟商业秘密指令》（TSD）的核心理念与目标，揭示二者融合的关键挑战；第三节通过物联网与B2G数据共享的具体制度，剖析《数据法案》在扩大数据访问同时保护商业秘密的路径；第四节指出数据秘密相对传统商业秘密观念的两大新颖特征：一是主管机构作为中间主体确认商业秘密的决策权，二是技术保护措施作为实现并可能扩展商业秘密效力的技术手段之核心作用。第五节得出结论：数据秘密显著补充了欧盟数据经济中现有商业秘密保护框架，但由此引发诸多需系统化解决的理论与解释性问题。
