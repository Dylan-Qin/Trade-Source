This chapter provides a general analysis of the rules, standards, and principles concerning digital trade found in preferential trade agreements (PTAs) and which countries and regions have fostered such development. It traces its evolution in three distinctive periods: a first generation of agreements, focused on electronic commerce rules; a second generation, centred on the development of data flows rules; and a third generation, that has seen the appearance of ‘pure’ digital trade agreements and new data economy rules. The chapter also examines the possibility of convergence in larger agreements (plurilateral or multilateral) based on the developments found in the three generations of PTAs.

本章对优惠贸易协定（PTAs）中涉及数字贸易的规则、标准和原则进行了总体分析，并探讨了哪些国家和地区推动了此类发展。研究将其演变过程划分为三个显著阶段：第一代协定以电子商务规则为核心；第二代协定聚焦于数据流动规则的制定；第三代则出现了"纯粹"的数字贸易协定和新型数据经济规则。基于这三代PTAs的发展轨迹，本章还探讨了在更广泛协议（诸边或多边）中实现规则趋同的可能性。
