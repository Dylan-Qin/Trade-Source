Weather derivatives are financial contracts that allow entities to hedge themselves against the adverse impacts of fluctuations in the weather. The pricing of such contracts is based on a combination of actuarial and arbitrage methods. Risk management of portfolios of weather derivatives centres on the estimation of two distributions: the expiry distribution and the short term risk distribution. These distributions can be used to calculate the expiry VaR and the VaR, respectively. The expiry distribution can be estimated relatively easily using the actuarial methods used to price contracts and manage portfolios. The short term risk distribution, however, is much more difficult to estimate since it depends on market dynamics and the statistics of changes in probabilistic meteorological forecasts. Nevertheless, we show that, under certain reasonable assumptions, the short term risk distribution for a large class of standard contracts takes a particularly simple form. It depends on a single volatility that can be derived without having to perform any statistical analysis of past forecasts. In addition we show that the framework we develop for calculating the short term risk distribution leads to a simple method for the actuarial valuation of options during the contract period.

天气衍生品是一种金融合约，允许实体对冲天气波动带来的不利影响。此类合约的定价基于精算与套利方法的结合。天气衍生品组合的风险管理核心在于对两种分布的估算：到期分布与短期风险分布。这两种分布可分别用于计算到期风险价值（VaR）和风险价值（VaR）。利用定价合约和管理组合的精算方法，到期分布相对容易估算。然而短期风险分布的估算则困难得多，因为它取决于市场动态和概率气象预报变化的统计特性。尽管如此，我们证明在特定合理假设下，大量标准合约的短期风险分布具有特别简单的形式——其仅取决于单一波动率参数，且无需对历史预测数据进行统计分析即可推导得出。此外，我们提出的短期风险分布计算框架还能衍生出合约期间期权精算估值的简易方法。
