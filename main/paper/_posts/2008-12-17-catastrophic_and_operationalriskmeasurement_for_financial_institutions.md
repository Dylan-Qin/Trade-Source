Recent debacles in the financial industry are a reminder that although risk management tools have greatly developed over the past 15 years, industry vulnerability has not declined proportionately.  In our study, we build on Allen and Bali (2007), and infer extreme risk in financial institutions and its operational component.  Our contribution is twofold: first, extending the specification and estimation procedure for the model, and then estimating on a dataset of European institutions, spanning major turmoil episodes in the past two decades. Operational risk is evaluated individually for each institution, by regressing monthly stock returns on proxies that capture institutions exposure to market and credit risks.  The residuals are used to infer operational VaR for financial companies using extreme value theory.  The results confirm the conclusion that the operational component of catastrophic risk can be inferred using market data.

金融业近期的危机提醒我们，尽管风险管理工具在过去15年取得了长足发展，但行业的脆弱性并未相应降低。本研究基于Allen和Bali（2007）的成果，推断了金融机构的极端风险及其操作风险成分。我们的贡献体现在两个方面：首先扩展了模型的设定与估计程序，随后对欧洲机构数据集进行估计——该数据集涵盖了过去二十年间的重大动荡事件。通过将月度股票收益率对反映机构市场风险与信用风险敞口的代理变量进行回归，我们分别评估了每家机构的操作风险。运用极值理论，这些残差被用于推断金融企业的操作风险在险价值。结果证实了以下结论：灾难性风险中的操作风险成分可通过市场数据进行推断。
