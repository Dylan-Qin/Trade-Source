We study auditors' client risk management in the first year of SOX 404 implementation, and find that there exists a pecking order among auditors' strategies to manage control risk resulting from internal control weaknesses.  We first examine the relations between internal control weaknesses and audit fee, audit fee increase, modified opinion, and auditor resignation, respectively, and establish that these are viable strategies to manage control risk on a stand-alone basis.  When we investigate these strategies simultaneously, descriptive evidence suggests that there exists a pecking order among auditors' client risk management strategies.  Our ordered logit analyses document that, as the clients' control risk increases, auditors are likely to respond in the order of audit fee adjustments, modified opinions, and auditor resignations.  We further create an index based on the severity of auditors' responses, and find that the degree of control risk is positively correlated with this auditor response index.  Our comprehensive evidence suggests that auditors use an array of ordered strategies to manage client-related control risk.

我们研究了《萨班斯-奥克斯利法案》404条款实施首年审计师的客户风险管理行为，发现审计师针对内部控制缺陷引发的控制风险存在层级化的管理策略。首先分别检验了内部控制缺陷与审计费用、审计费用增长、非标准审计意见及审计师辞任之间的关系，证实这些策略单独运用时均可有效管理控制风险。当我们同步考察这些策略时，描述性证据表明审计师的客户风险管理策略存在优先顺序。有序逻辑回归分析显示，随着客户控制风险上升，审计师可能依次采取审计费用调整、出具非标准意见和终止审计合约的应对措施。我们进一步根据审计师反应强度构建指数，发现控制风险程度与该反应指数呈正相关。综合证据表明，审计师采用了一系列有序策略来管理客户相关的控制风险。
