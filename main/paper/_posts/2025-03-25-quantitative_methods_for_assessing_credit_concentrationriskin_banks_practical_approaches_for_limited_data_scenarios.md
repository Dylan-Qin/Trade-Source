Recently, banks have been contending with increasing credit risk, particularly as financial markets display signs of instability. The focal point of these concerns is credit concentration risk, which highlights the potential for significant losses when a borrower has excessive credit connections. In regions like China, banks frequently encounter difficulties due to unreliable data sources, creating challenges for traditional risk assessment models(Jiang C et al., 2024). Conventional techniques often struggle to navigate such uncertain conditions, leading to a growing interest in innovative solutions such as rough set theory, a method that can provide insights even in situations of incomplete data. With the continuously evolving financial landscape, there is a critical need for adaptable quantitative approaches to effectively manage credit concentration risk. This research urges a reevaluation of risk management practices to address the complexities of today's financial environment.

近期，银行正面临日益加剧的信用风险，尤其在金融市场显现不稳定迹象之际。这些担忧的核心在于信用集中风险——当借款人存在过度信贷关联时，可能引发重大损失。在中国等地区，银行常因数据来源不可靠而陷入困境，这给传统风险评估模型带来了挑战（Jiang C等，2024）。传统方法往往难以应对此类不确定状况，使得粗糙集理论等创新解决方案备受关注，该方法即便在不完整数据条件下仍能提供有效洞见。随着金融环境持续演变，亟需采用适应性强的量化手段来有效管控信用集中风险。本研究呼吁重新审视风险管理实践，以应对当今金融环境的复杂性。
