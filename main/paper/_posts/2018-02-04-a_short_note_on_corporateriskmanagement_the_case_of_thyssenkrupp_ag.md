Based on the most recent annual report of thyssenkrupp we look for various features of modern risk management. It appears that there could be challenges to have a full view of low probability and high impact risks, to be able to perceive concentration as well as wrong way risks and to capture risk dependencies. Also, we perform a multiple linear regression to identify key drivers for EBITDA. We identify two and find the transparency on their potential adverse impacts to be limited in the current reporting. Especially in light of the strategy to become a diversified industrial group it might be worthwhile to expand the mentioned capabilities - or reveal more of them in the annual reporting.

根据蒂森克虏伯最新年报，我们研究了现代风险管理的多个特征。目前看来，在全面掌握低概率高影响风险、识别集中度风险与逆向风险、以及捕捉风险关联性方面可能存在挑战。同时，我们通过多元线性回归分析确定了息税折旧摊销前利润（EBITDA）的关键驱动因素，发现其中两项因素在当前报告中对潜在负面影响的透明度有限。特别是考虑到集团向多元化工业集团转型的战略，提升上述风险管理能力——或在年报中更充分披露相关信息——将具有重要价值。
