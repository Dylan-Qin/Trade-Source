Increased risk exposure levels, technological developments and the growing information overload in supply chain networks drive organizations to embrace data-driven approaches in Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM). Data Mining (DM) employs multiple analytical techniques for intelligent and timely decision making; however, its potential is not entirely explored for SCRM. The paper aims to develop a DM-based framework for the identification, assessment and mitigation of different type of risks in supply chains. A holistic approach integrates DM and risk management activities in a unique framework for effective risk management. The framework is validated with a case study based on a series of semi-structured interviews, discussions and a focus group study. The study showcases how DM supports in discovering hidden and useful information from unstructured risk data for making intelligent risk management decisions.

供应链网络中不断增加的风险暴露水平、技术发展以及日益严重的信息过载问题，正推动各组织在供应链风险管理（SCRM）中采用数据驱动方法。数据挖掘（DM）通过多种分析技术实现智能化的及时决策，但其在SCRM领域的潜力尚未得到充分发掘。本文旨在开发一个基于DM的框架，用于识别、评估和缓解供应链中的各类风险。该框架采用整体性方法，将DM与风险管理活动整合于统一体系，以实现高效风险管理。通过基于半结构化访谈、专题讨论和焦点小组研究的案例验证，该研究展示了DM如何从非结构化风险数据中挖掘隐藏的有效信息，从而为智能化风险管理决策提供支持。
