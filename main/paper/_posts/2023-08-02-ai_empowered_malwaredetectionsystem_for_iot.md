The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the way we live and work. However, the increased connectivity of IoT devices has also made them a target for malware attacks. Traditional malware detection methods are not always effective against IoT malware, as they often rely on signatures that attackers can easily circumvent. In this paper, we propose an AI-powered malware detection system for IoT. Our system uses a hybrid deep learning approach that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory networks (LSTM). CNNs are used to extract features from IoT malware binary code, and LSTM networks are used to model the temporal relationships between these features. We evaluate the system against his three datasets of publicly available IoT malware. As a result, we found that our system achieved him a high accuracy of 99.98% in detecting his IoT malware. We also show that our system is effective against zero-day IoT malware, malware that has not yet been discovered by security researchers.

物联网（IoT）彻底改变了我们的生活和工作方式。然而，IoT设备连接性的增强也使其成为恶意软件攻击的目标。传统的恶意软件检测方法并不总能有效应对IoT恶意软件，因为它们通常依赖于攻击者容易绕过的特征签名。本文提出了一种基于AI的IoT恶意软件检测系统。该系统采用混合深度学习方法，结合了卷积神经网络（CNN）和长短期记忆网络（LSTM）。CNN用于从IoT恶意软件二进制代码中提取特征，而LSTM网络则用于建模这些特征之间的时序关系。我们在三个公开可用的IoT恶意软件数据集上对该系统进行了评估。结果表明，我们的系统在检测IoT恶意软件时达到了99.98%的高准确率。我们还证明，该系统对零日IoT恶意软件（即尚未被安全研究人员发现的恶意软件）同样有效。
