Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS) require auditors to evaluate internal control and assess control risk when performing an audit. Among the factors to be considered are the control environment, control activities, management's attitude's toward internal control, and culture.  Research on how, or whether, culture influences auditors' evaluation of internal control and assessment of control risk is lacking in the literature. The purpose of this study is to serve as a first step in determining whether culture influences auditors' evaluation of internal control and assessment of control risk and if so, how. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on a non-random sample of 200 CPAs in the U.S. to determine whether there are differences in auditors' evaluation of internal control and assessment of control risk in different cultures. Using Hofstede's cultural dimensions (individualism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance and masculinity), the results of the study indicate that auditors evaluate internal control and assess control risk significantly different for companies that operate in countries that are on opposite ends of the cultural continuum as measured by Hofstede's dimensions. The results of the test suggest that for internal control there is a "culture risk" at work, that can be defined as the risk that an entity's internal control maybe be less (more) effective, with a higher (lower) degree of control risk, purely as a function of the culture in which the entity operates. Auditors assess control risk higher for companies operating in countries with a low individualism score, a high power distance score, and a low uncertainty avoidance score. They also evaluate total internal control as less effective in countries with a low individualism score, a high power distance score, a low masculinity score and a low uncertainty avoidance score. Areas for future research are suggested.

《公认审计准则》(GAAS)要求审计师在执行审计时评估内部控制并判断控制风险。需考量的因素包括控制环境、控制活动、管理层对内部控制的态度以及文化因素。现有文献缺乏关于文化如何（或是否）影响审计师对内部控制的评估及控制风险判断的研究。本研究旨在初步探讨文化是否会影响审计师对内部控制的评估及控制风险判断，若存在影响，则进一步分析其作用机制。. . 通过对美国200名注册会计师的非随机样本进行方差分析(ANOVA)，本研究检验了不同文化背景下审计师对内部控制评估及控制风险判断的差异性。基于霍夫斯泰德文化维度理论（个人主义、权力距离、不确定性规避和男性气质），研究结果显示：对于处于霍夫斯泰德文化维度两极的国家运营的企业，审计师对其内部控制的评估和控制风险的判断存在显著差异。测试结果表明，在内部控制领域存在"文化风险"——即实体内部控制的有效性可能降低（或提升），控制风险水平可能增高（或降低），这纯粹取决于该实体所处的文化环境。. . 研究发现：对于在低个人主义、高权力距离和低不确定性规避文化国家运营的企业，审计师会判定其控制风险更高；同时在低个人主义、高权力距离、低男性气质和低不确定性规避文化国家，审计师对整体内部控制有效性的评价更低。文末提出了未来研究的建议方向。
