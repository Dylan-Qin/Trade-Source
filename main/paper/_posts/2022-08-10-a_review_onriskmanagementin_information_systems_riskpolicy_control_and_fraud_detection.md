Businesses are bombarded with great deals of risks, vulnerabilities, and unforeseen business interruptions in their lifetime, which negatively affect their productivity and sustainability within the market. Such risks require a risk management system to identify risks and risk factors and propose approaches to eliminate or reduce them. Risk management involves highly structured practices that should be implemented within an organization, including organizational planning documents. Continuity planning and fraud detection policy development are among the many critically important practices conducted through risk management that aim to mitigate risk factors, their vulnerability, and their impact. Information systems play a pivotal role in any organization by providing many benefits, such as reducing human errors and associated risks owing to the employment of sophisticated algorithms. Both the development and establishment of an information system within an organization contributes to mitigating business-related risks and also creates new types of risks associated with its establishment. Businesses must prepare for, react to, and recover from unprecedented threats that might emerge in the years or decades that follow. This paper provides a comprehensive narrative review of risk management in information systems coupled with its application in fraud detection and continuity planning.

企业在存续期间会面临大量风险、漏洞和不可预见的业务中断，这些负面因素会削弱其生产力和市场可持续性。此类风险需要借助风险管理体系来识别风险因素，并提出消除或降低风险的解决方案。风险管理包含一系列高度结构化的实践措施，应通过组织规划文件等形式在企业内部落实。其中，业务连续性规划和反欺诈政策制定是风险管理的核心实践，旨在降低风险因素的脆弱性及其影响。信息系统通过运用复杂算法减少人为错误及相关风险，为各类组织提供关键支撑。但信息系统的开发建设在降低业务风险的同时，也会带来新型风险。企业必须为未来数十年可能出现的突发威胁做好预防、应对和恢复准备。本文系统综述了信息系统的风险管理及其在反欺诈和连续性规划中的应用。
