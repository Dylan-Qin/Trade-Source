The world’s economy did not suffer de-globalisation after the 2008-2009 Global Crisis, but entered a phase of "New Normal". While trade-income elasticity has been returning to its pre-1990s long-term values, the world is much more open to trade today than it was 25 years ago.  We show that part of the slowdown in trade can be attributed to a reduction in the rate of convergence between developed and developing countries, after a phase of high growth differential from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s. The rise of global value chains was another factor that contributed to this phenomenon, itself linked to a significant reduction in trade frictions in the 1990s, explained both by technological innovations and by important trade agreements. On the other hand, with the rise of income, household consumption of services such as housing, health and education increases more rapidly than demand for goods. Most of these services are less tradable than merchandises and the trade-in-services frictions in a gravity model tend to be higher than for goods. Though in the long run, rising income will induce a shift in demand towards less trade-intensive services, there is still a long march ahead for many developing countries while trade costs remain quite sizeable. In the shorter term, the WTO Agreement on Trade Facilitation creates an opportunity for reducing those trade costs.

全球经济在2008-2009年危机后并未出现逆全球化，而是进入了"新常态"阶段。虽然贸易收入弹性正逐渐回归1990年代前的长期水平，但当今世界贸易开放度仍远高于25年前。研究表明，贸易增速放缓部分源于1990年代中期至2000年代中期高速增长差异期结束后，发达国家与发展中国家收敛速率的下降。全球价值链的崛起是另一关键因素，这与1990年代技术创新和重大贸易协定共同推动的贸易摩擦显著降低密切相关。另一方面，随着收入增长，居民对住房、医疗、教育等服务消费的增速远超商品需求。这些服务大多比货物更难贸易，引力模型中的服务贸易摩擦通常也高于货物贸易。尽管长期来看收入增长将推动需求转向贸易密集度更低的服务领域，但对许多发展中国家而言，在贸易成本仍居高不下的情况下，这仍是漫长征途。短期来看，《WTO贸易便利化协定》为降低这些贸易成本提供了契机。
