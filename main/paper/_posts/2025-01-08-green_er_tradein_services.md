Trade in services regulation typically does not distinguish between environment-related services and other services. However, international economic law both at the multilateral level (GATS) and at the regional or bilateral level (Preferential Trade Agreements) provides the flexibility necessary for the promotion of environmental policies through an increase in access to and availability of affordable, high-quality environment-related services.

服务贸易法规通常不区分环境相关服务与其他服务。然而，无论是多边层面（《服务贸易总协定》）还是区域或双边层面（优惠贸易协定），国际经济法都为通过增加可负担、高质量环境相关服务的获取与供给来促进环境政策提供了必要的灵活性。
