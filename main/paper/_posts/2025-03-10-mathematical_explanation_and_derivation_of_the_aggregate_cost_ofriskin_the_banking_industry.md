The banking industry operates within a complex environment where financial risks are inherent and multifaceted, necessitating a rigorous understanding of the aggregate cost of risk. This concept encapsulates various risks, including credit, market, and operational risks, which are crucial for effective financial management and regulatory compliance. The mathematical explanation and derivation of the aggregate cost of risk serve not only to clarify the relationships between these risks but also to enhance transparency and predictability in risk assessment. In recent years, the proliferation of sophisticated models, particularly those grounded in Artificial Intelligence, has further complicated this landscape; many of these models remain black-boxes in their decision-making processes, hampering trust and interpretability ((Hassija V et al., 2023)). As the need for explainable AI (XAI) methodologies escalates, understanding the mathematical principles underlying the aggregate cost of risk becomes imperative for both theoretical inquiry and practical application ((Ali S et al., 2023)).

银行业运营于一个复杂的环境中，金融风险具有内在性与多面性，因此必须严格理解风险总成本。这一概念涵盖了信用风险、市场风险和操作风险等多种风险，对于有效的财务管理和监管合规至关重要。风险总成本的数学解释与推导不仅能阐明这些风险之间的关系，还能提升风险评估的透明度和可预测性。近年来，复杂模型（尤其是基于人工智能的模型）的激增进一步加剧了这一领域的复杂性；其中许多模型在决策过程中仍处于黑箱状态，削弱了信任度与可解释性（Hassija V等，2023）。随着对可解释人工智能（XAI）方法的需求日益增长，理解风险总成本背后的数学原理已成为理论探索与实际应用的必然要求（Ali S等，2023）。
