Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is rapidly transforming the financial system through provision of decentralized alternatives to traditional financial services. However, the inherent risks that come with DeFi, such as smart contract exploits, liquidity crises, market manipulation, and volatility of cryptocurrency assets, are significant barriers to its adoption. Traditional risk management measures are insufficient due to the decentralized, permissionless, and open nature of DeFi platforms. Hence, machine learning (ML) algorithms have been spoken of as one of the promising solutions for DeFi risk management and assessment automation (Adebayo 2023). This paper presents the application of machine learning techniques to DeFi risk analysis. From huge volumes of data from DeFi protocols, including transaction history, smart contract interactions, market trends, and token price movements, ML models can identify patterns and predict probable risks, e.g., smart contract failure, market crash, and liquidity crisis. We touch upon significant ML models such as supervised learning (e.g., decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines), unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering algorithms), and reinforcement learning and show their usability in risk prediction, anomaly detection, and decision-making within DeFi protocols. Furthermore, pairing the advanced ML models with decentralized oracles and data sources anchored in blockchain technology would make the accuracy and speed of risk assessments stronger to allow continuous monitoring and countering of threats. We briefly address constraints and setbacks related to implementing machine learning within risk management for DeFi, i.e., the issue of the quality of available data, explaining the machine models, and development of DeFi protocols. The study highlights the potential for ML to contribute to the future of DeFi through enabling instruments for more efficient risk tracking and mitigation, increased confidence and security in the system.

去中心化金融（DeFi）正通过提供传统金融服务的去中心化替代方案，迅速改变金融体系。然而，DeFi固有的风险，如智能合约漏洞、流动性危机、市场操纵以及加密货币资产波动性，是其广泛采用的重要障碍。由于DeFi平台去中心化、无需许可和开放的特性，传统的风险管理措施显得不足。因此，机器学习（ML）算法被视为DeFi风险管理和评估自动化的有前景的解决方案之一（Adebayo 2023）。本文探讨了机器学习技术在DeFi风险分析中的应用。通过分析DeFi协议产生的大量数据，包括交易历史、智能合约交互、市场趋势和代币价格变动，机器学习模型能够识别模式并预测潜在风险，例如智能合约故障、市场崩盘和流动性危机。我们讨论了重要的机器学习模型，如监督学习（如决策树、随机森林和支持向量机）、无监督学习（如聚类算法）以及强化学习，并展示了它们在DeFi协议中风险预测、异常检测和决策制定方面的实用性。此外，将先进的机器学习模型与基于区块链技术的去中心化预言机和数据源相结合，可以增强风险评估的准确性和速度，实现持续监控和威胁应对。我们还简要探讨了在DeFi风险管理中应用机器学习所面临的限制和挑战，包括可用数据质量问题、机器学习模型的可解释性以及DeFi协议的开发。本研究强调了机器学习通过提供更高效的风险跟踪和缓解工具，提升系统信心和安全性，从而为DeFi未来发展做出贡献的潜力。
