In contrast to research showing that private litigation discourages audit clients from disclosing internal control weaknesses, we find that auditors’ litigation concerns have a countervailing effect. Our empirical results show that adverse internal control opinions reduces the likelihood of auditors being implicated in lawsuits against their clients, which suggests that disclosing internal control weaknesses can protect auditors from litigation. Consistent with the notion that such litigation protection in turn encourages auditors to issue adverse internal control opinions, we find that both new and incumbent auditors are more likely to issue adverse internal control opinions for clients with higher ex ante litigation risk. Moreover, for restating firms that eventually acknowledge the existence of internal control weaknesses, ex ante litigation risk is positively associated with earlier adverse internal control opinions. Overall, our evidence suggests that litigation threat provides an incentive rather than a disincentive for auditors to issue adverse internal control opinions in a timely fashion. As both new and incumbent auditors have such incentives, auditors’ litigation concerns suppress clients’ opportunistic internal control opinion shopping.

与研究表明私人诉讼会抑制审计客户披露内部控制缺陷不同，我们发现审计师的诉讼担忧会产生抵消效应。实证结果表明，不利的内部控制意见能降低审计师被卷入客户诉讼的概率，这表明披露内部控制缺陷可以保护审计师免受诉讼。与此观点一致的是，这种诉讼保护反过来会促使审计师更倾向于出具不利的内部控制意见——我们发现无论是新任还是现任审计师，对于事前诉讼风险较高的客户都更可能出具此类意见。此外，对于最终承认存在内部控制缺陷的重述企业，事前诉讼风险与早期不利内部控制意见呈正相关。总体而言，我们的证据表明诉讼威胁会激励而非阻碍审计师及时出具不利的内部控制意见。由于新任和现任审计师均存在这种动机，审计师的诉讼关切有效抑制了客户机会主义地挑选内部控制意见的行为。
