This study provides empirical evidence of how both the trading partners have adopted strict trade regime. Findings of the Grubel Lloyd Index (GLI), and different cases of agritrade barriers that Australia has restricted India’s agro- products mostly through non- tariff measures (NTMs) whereas India although being a frequent user of NTMs has frequently applied import duties on Australia’s agro- products. This article concludes that both economies may get benefits by providing market access, technology and expertise in agriculture sector to each other. This study is an eye opener for both the country’s stakeholders as reducing trade obstacles would yield more benefits for bilateral agri- trade.

本研究探讨了印度与澳大利亚之间农业贸易日益增长的复杂性与争议。作为全球主要消费市场之一，印度为澳大利亚提供了独特的贸易机遇；而作为最发达经济体之一，澳大利亚也为印度带来诸多农业贸易前景。研究通过实证数据揭示两国如何实施严格的贸易管制：格鲁贝尔-劳埃德指数(GLI)测算结果显示，澳大利亚主要通过非关税措施(NTMs)限制印度农产品，而印度虽频繁采用NTMs，却更多对澳大利亚农产品实施进口关税。本文结论表明，双方通过相互开放农业市场准入、共享技术与专业知识可实现互利共赢。这项研究为两国利益相关者敲响警钟——减少贸易壁垒将为双边农业贸易创造更大效益。
