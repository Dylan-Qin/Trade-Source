In his State of the Union speech, President Obama announced that the United States will launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union. This initiative is big news, and potentially a game-changer for trade liberalization. For years now, trade talks at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other fora have been stalled or grinding along slowly. By limiting the transatlantic talks to two economies that are relatively supportive of free trade, and are at the same development level, perhaps trade negotiators will at last have some success. A completed agreement here could generate momentum for broader trade liberalization around the world. More immediately, the economic benefits of this trade deal would be great, as the United States and the European Union are the two largest economies in the world, and their trade flows with the world account for almost one third of global trade. However, there may be some stumbling blocks along the way. If the United States and the European Union take on an agenda that is too broad, it may turn out that these trade talks fare no better than other current trade talks. In order to succeed, it is important that the negotiations have realistic goals and a clear path to completion. The precise scope of the talks remains somewhat vague at this point, but a framework is set out in the Final Report of the U.S.–EU High-Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth. The report indicates that various forms of protectionism will be addressed, and also suggests that the talks will delve further into domestic regulatory issues than most current trade agreements do. While such an expansion of international trade rules does hold the potential for significant economic benefits, it also tests the limits of how far trade agreements can go in terms of global trade governance. Including issues that the trading system cannot handle may doom the talks from the start, and negotiators should be careful about how they approach this.

美国总统奥巴马在国情咨文中宣布，美国将与欧盟启动全面的《跨大西洋贸易与投资伙伴关系协定》谈判。这一举措意义重大，可能成为贸易自由化的转折点。多年来，世界贸易组织（WTO）及其他多边框架下的贸易谈判始终陷于停滞或进展迟缓。此次谈判仅限两个自由贸易支持度高且发展水平相当的经济体参与，或许能让贸易谈判者首次看到成功的曙光。协定的达成有望为全球范围内更广泛的贸易自由化注入动力。更直接来看，这份贸易协定将带来巨大经济效益——美欧作为全球前两大经济体，其对外贸易总额占全球贸易近三分之一。但谈判进程可能面临阻碍。若美欧设定的议程过于宽泛，这些贸易谈判或将重蹈当前其他贸易谈判的覆辙。为确保成功，谈判必须设定现实目标并明确完成路径。目前谈判的具体范围尚不明确，但《美欧就业与增长高级别工作组最终报告》已勾勒出基本框架。报告显示将解决各类保护主义问题，并暗示谈判将比现行多数贸易协定更深入触及国内监管议题。尽管这种国际贸易规则的扩展可能带来显著经济效益，但也试探着贸易协定在全球贸易治理范畴的边界。纳入现有贸易体系无法处理的议题可能使谈判伊始就注定失败，谈判代表须审慎把握尺度。
