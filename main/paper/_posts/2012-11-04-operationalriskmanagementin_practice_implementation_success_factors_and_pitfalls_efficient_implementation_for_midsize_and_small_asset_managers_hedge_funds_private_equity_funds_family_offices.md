According to the often-cited CapCo study (2003) about hedge fund failures, 50% of the failures were driven by Operational Risk. Not only for hedge funds, but also for other asset management companies – such as private equity companies, family offices or independent asset managers - operational risk management is increasingly important. In this article, we focus on Operational Risk Management for mid-sized Asset Management companies. We take a practitioner’s view of how an operational risk framework can be implemented as part of an enterprise wide Risk and Control system in a “hands-on” approach. The focus of our contribution is on practical implementation with simple tools, like Excel, rather than trying to quantify operational risk with complex mathematical formulas. We outline how a mid-sized asset management organisation can develop systematically an integrated perspective on its main risks and set priorities on how to mitigate and control these risks.

根据常被引用的CapCo研究（2003年）关于对冲基金失败的分析，50%的失败由操作风险导致。不仅是对冲基金，其他资产管理公司——如私募股权公司、家族办公室或独立资产管理人——操作风险管理正变得日益重要。本文聚焦于中型资产管理公司的操作风险管理。我们从实践者视角出发，以"实操"方式探讨如何将操作风险框架作为企业全面风险与控制系统的一部分实施。本文重点在于通过Excel等简单工具进行实际落地，而非试图用复杂数学公式量化操作风险。我们概述了中型资产管理机构如何系统化建立对其主要风险的综合视角，并确定缓解与控制这些风险的优先顺序。
