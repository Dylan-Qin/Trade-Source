In an attempt to disentangle the impact of sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures on trade patterns, we estimate a Heckman selection model on the HS4 disaggregated level of trade. Using SPS measures obtained from the SPS Information Management System of the WTO and controlling for zero trade flows, we find that SPS concerns reduce the probability of trade in agricultural and food products consistently. However, the amount of trade is positively affected by SPS measures conditional on market entry. This suggests that SPS measures constitute an effective market entry barrier. Additionally, we split SPS measures into requirements related to conformity assessment, and product characteristics. Both types of measures are implemented by policy makers to achieve a desired level of health safety, yet, entail diverse trade costs. We find that conformity assessment measures hamper not only the likelihood to trade but also the amount of trade, while measures related to product characteristics do not affect the market entry decision, but have a strong positive impact on the trade volume. This suggests that trade outcomes crucially depend on the measure policy makers decide to implement.

为厘清卫生与植物检疫（SPS）措施对贸易模式的影响，我们在HS4细分贸易层级上构建了赫克曼选择模型。通过采用WTO的SPS信息管理系统中获取的SPS措施数据，并控制零贸易流量后，我们发现SPS关切持续降低农产品和食品贸易的发生概率。然而在进入市场的前提下，SPS措施对贸易量却产生正向影响，这表明SPS措施构成了有效的市场准入壁垒。此外，我们将SPS措施划分为符合性评估要求和产品特性要求两类。虽然政策制定者实施这两类措施均旨在实现特定健康安全标准，但其产生的贸易成本存在差异。研究发现：符合性评估措施不仅抑制贸易发生概率，还会缩减贸易规模；而产品特性措施虽不影响市场准入决策，却对贸易量产生显著正向影响。这表明贸易效果本质上取决于政策制定者选择实施的措施类型。
