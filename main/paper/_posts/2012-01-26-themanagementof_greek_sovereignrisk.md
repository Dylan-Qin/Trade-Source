In 2010 the excessive public spending produced the first sovereign bond market crisis in Europe: Greece. The Hellenic crisis is the product of years of recession, of the sluggish economic environment and poor productivity – but above all it is the product of the mismanagement of the public finance, of unsatisfactory reporting, risk management and accounting practices. Information about Greece is scarce and fragmented, but the inability by European authorities to understand the incredible mismanagement strongly disappoints the taxpayer. The relevant exposure of European banks in the bond market toward the default risk of Greece supports the need for hedging tools, such as Credit Default Swaps. However, there is evidence that the CDS market on Greek sovereign bonds is segmented, and contracts are mis-priced. The lack of comprehensive data on CDS and other OTC contracts impedes any further investigation. European authorities should consider revising CDSs trading rules and requirements, until the risks produced are properly limited.

2010年，过度的公共支出引发了欧洲首场主权债券市场危机：希腊。这场希腊危机是多年经济衰退、疲软经济环境和低效生产力的产物——但归根结底源于公共财政管理不善、财务报告不达标、风险管理与会计实务缺陷。关于希腊的信息稀缺且零散，但欧洲当局对这种严重管理失察的无知令纳税人深感失望。欧洲银行在债券市场对希腊违约风险的相关敞口，凸显了对信用违约互换等对冲工具的需求。然而有证据表明希腊主权债券的CDS市场存在分割现象，合约定价存在偏差。CDS及其他场外合约数据的全面缺失阻碍了进一步调查。欧洲当局应考虑修订信用违约互换的交易规则和要求，直至其产生的风险得到有效控制。
