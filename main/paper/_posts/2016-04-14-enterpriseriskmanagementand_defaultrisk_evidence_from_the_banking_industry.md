Enterprise risk management (ERM) has emerged as a framework for more holistic and integrated risk management with an emphasis on enhanced governance of the risk management system. ERM should theoretically reduce the volatility of cash flows, agency risk and information risk – ultimately reducing a firm’s default risk. We empirically investigate the relationship between the degree of ERM implementation and default risk in a panel dataset covering 78 of the world’s largest banks. We create a novel measure of the degree of ERM implementation. We find that a higher degree of ERM implementation is negatively related to the credit default swap spread (CDS) of a bank. When a rich set of control variables and fixed effects are included, a one standard deviation increase in the degree of ERM implementation decreases CDS spreads by 21 basis points. The degree of ERM implementation is however not a significant determinant of credit ratings when controls for corporate governance are included.

企业风险管理（ERM）已成为一个更全面、更综合的风险管理框架，强调对风险管理体系的强化治理。理论上，ERM应能降低现金流的波动性、代理风险和信息风险，最终减少企业的违约风险。我们基于涵盖全球78家大型银行的面板数据，实证研究了ERM实施程度与违约风险之间的关系。我们创新性地构建了衡量ERM实施程度的指标，发现较高的ERM实施程度与银行的信用违约互换利差（CDS）呈负相关。在纳入大量控制变量和固定效应后，ERM实施程度每提高一个标准差，CDS利差会下降21个基点。但当加入公司治理控制变量时，ERM实施程度对信用评级的影响并不显著。
