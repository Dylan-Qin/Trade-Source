This study investigates the impact of risk governance on bank risk within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) public commercial banks. Utilizing Knight’s (1921) distinction between risk and uncertainty, it emphasizes the roles of key figures like bank directors, the chief risk officer (CRO), and the chief financial officer (CFO) in risk management. The research employs multivariate regression analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) to reveal a positive correlation between risk governance and the Tier 1 capital ratio, indicating that effective governance leads to reduced bank risk and increased financial stability. This finding is consistent with Aebi et al.’s (2012) study on risk management and bank performance. These results underscore the crucial role of robust risk governance in banking, suggesting that enhanced governance practices can significantly mitigate risks. The study contributes to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence supporting the quantification of risk through governance mechanisms, aligning with, and enriching current theoretical frameworks. While highlighting the importance of these findings, the study also acknowledges its limitations, such as potential endogeneity issues, and suggests directions for future research to expand the understanding of risk governance’s impact on bank behavior, including the exploration of additional variables and the integration of qualitative methodologies. This research holds significant implications for banking institutions and regulatory bodies, advocating for a deeper examination of risk governance strategies in banking.

本研究探讨了经济合作与发展组织（OECD）公共商业银行中风险治理对银行风险的影响。基于奈特（1921）对风险与不确定性的区分，研究重点分析了银行董事、首席风险官（CRO）和首席财务官（CFO）在风险管理中的角色。通过多元回归分析和主成分分析（PCA），研究发现风险治理与一级资本充足率呈正相关，表明有效治理能降低银行风险并增强金融稳定性。这一发现与Aebi等人（2012）关于风险管理与银行绩效的研究结论一致。研究结果凸显了健全风险治理在银行业中的关键作用，表明强化治理实践可显著降低风险。本研究通过提供支持治理机制量化风险的实证证据，补充并丰富了现有理论框架。在强调这些发现重要性的同时，研究也承认其局限性（如潜在的内生性问题），并为未来研究指明了方向，包括探索更多变量及整合定性方法，以深化对风险治理影响银行行为的理解。该研究对银行机构和监管机构具有重要启示，倡导更深入地审视银行业风险治理策略。
