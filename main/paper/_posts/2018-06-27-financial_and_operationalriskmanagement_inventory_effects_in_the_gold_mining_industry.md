Financial and operational risk management are central concepts at the intersection of finance, operations, and commodity risk management.  Yet, empirical evidence on their effects on inventory is lacking.  We use a fine-grained data set comprising the financial and operational risk management decisions of gold miners from 2003 to 2011 to empirically assess the effects of risk management on inventory.  Faced with volatile gold prices, miners may manage (output) risk financially by committing to sell future gold production and lock in prices.  They may also manage (input) costs operationally by varying the quality of ore they extract and process, thereby altering the costs they incur and influencing inventory holdings.  In addition to affecting profitability, we show that these two risk management strategies have implications for inventory holdings. We find that a one-standard deviation increase in financial risk management (FRM) is associated with an 14.3% decrease in inventory, as FRM decreases the option value of delaying processing inventory. On the other hand, a one-standard deviation increase in operational risk management (ORM) is associated with a 3.5% increase in inventory.  We also find evidence that, in this context, FRM and ORM could be viewed as complements.

财务与运营风险管理是金融、运营及商品风险管理交叉领域的核心概念。然而，关于它们对库存影响的实证证据仍属空白。我们利用2003至2011年间金矿企业财务与运营风险管理决策的细粒度数据集，实证评估了风险管理对库存的影响。面对波动的金价，矿企可通过承诺出售未来黄金产量并锁定价格来实施（产出端）财务风险管理；也可通过调整开采和加工矿石的品质来实施（投入端）运营风险管理，从而改变成本支出并影响库存持有量。研究表明，这两种风险管理策略除影响盈利能力外，还会对库存持有产生显著影响：财务风险管理（FRM）每增加一个标准差，库存量会减少14.3%，因为FRM降低了延迟加工库存的期权价值；而运营风险管理（ORM）每增加一个标准差，库存量则增加3.5%。我们还发现证据表明，在此情境下FRM与ORM可被视为互补策略。
