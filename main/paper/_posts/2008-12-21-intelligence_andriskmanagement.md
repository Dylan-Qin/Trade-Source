This paper summarizes a two-year project working with risk management specialists in finance, health care, political risk, engineering, and other fields to understand how risk management applies to intelligence and international security affairs.  It distinguishes between two broad approaches for risk management implementation in complex organizations (large companies, the U.S. intelligence community).  Tactical approaches focus on particular models (VaR, option theory, fault trees, etc.) while strategic approaches take an enlarged view of key managerial and contextual factors which shape the actual use of risk management.  As environments become more turbulent, managers should focus far more on these strategic, rather than tactical approaches to managing risk.

本文总结了一项为期两年的项目，该项目与金融、医疗保健、政治风险、工程等领域的风险管理专家合作，旨在理解风险管理如何应用于情报和国际安全事务。文章区分了复杂组织（大型企业、美国情报界）实施风险管理的两种主要方法：战术性方法侧重于特定模型（如风险价值模型、期权理论、故障树分析等），而战略性方法则从更宏观的视角审视影响风险管理实际应用的关键管理和环境因素。随着环境日益动荡，管理者应更加注重这些战略性方法，而非战术性方法来管理风险。
