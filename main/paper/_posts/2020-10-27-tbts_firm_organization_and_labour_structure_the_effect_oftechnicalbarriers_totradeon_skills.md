Trade shocks in export markets may affect the employment composition and the organization of exporting firms. In particular, the imposition of new technological standards in destination markets may force exporters to adjust the firm's organization to comply and cope with the additional complexity of the new production process. This paper investigates the effects on firms' organization of shocks induced by the introduction of Technical Barriers to Trade (TBTs) in exporting countries. It relies on the Specific Trade Concern (STC) data released by the WTO to identify trade-restrictive TBT measures, combined with matched employer-employee data for the population of French exporters over the period 1995-2010. It also exploits information on the list of product-destinations served by each French exporter. Controlling for tariffs and for a given state of technology in the sector of the firm, it finds that exporters respond to increased complexity associated with restrictive Technical Barriers to Trade at destination by raising the share of managers at the expense of blue collars, white collars and professionals. This paper is related to the growing literature exploring how firms organize production in hierarchies to economize on their use of knowledge. It is also related to the well beaten literature on the labour market effects of trade, but from the perspective of exports rather than imports.

出口市场的贸易冲击可能会影响出口企业的就业结构和组织架构。特别是目标市场实施的新技术标准可能迫使出口商调整企业组织，以遵守并应对新生产流程带来的额外复杂性。本文研究了出口国引入技术性贸易壁垒（TBTs）所引发的冲击对企业组织的影响。研究采用世贸组织发布的特定贸易关切（STC）数据来识别限制性TBT措施，并结合1995-2010年间法国所有出口企业的雇主-雇员匹配数据。同时利用每家法国出口商所涉及的产品-目的地清单信息。在控制关税和企业所在行业技术水平的条件下，研究发现出口商为应对目标市场限制性技术性贸易壁垒带来的复杂性提升，会通过增加管理人员占比来调整组织结构，同时减少蓝领、白领和专业人员的比例。本文与探讨企业如何通过层级化生产组织来优化知识运用的新兴文献相关，同时也从出口而非进口的视角，呼应了关于贸易对劳动力市场影响的经典研究领域。
