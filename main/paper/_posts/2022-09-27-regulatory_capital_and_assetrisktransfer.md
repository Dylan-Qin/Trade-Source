We explore whether life insurers use a unique reinsurance arrangement to manage assets tied to their regulatory capital. Typical reinsurance allows insurers to reduce their regulatory capital by transferring liabilities (reserves), and the associated assets, to reinsurers. With modified coinsurance, insurers maintain control of their assets and liabilities while transferring regulatory capital requirements to the reinsurer. Holding fixed an insurer’s reported capital, we find that modified coinsurance allows insurers to report higher risk-based capital ratios. Insurers with modified coinsurance are less likely to fire sale downgraded bonds. We also find suggestive evidence of regulatory arbitrage, as most modified coinsurance is purchased from reinsurers in countries with low capital requirements or within the same insurance group.

我们探讨寿险公司是否利用一种独特的再保险安排来管理与其监管资本相关的资产。传统再保险允许保险公司通过将负债（准备金）及相关资产转移给再保险人来降低监管资本要求。而在修正共保模式下，保险公司在将监管资本要求转移给再保险人的同时，仍保留对自身资产和负债的控制权。在保持保险公司账面资本不变的情况下，我们发现修正共保能使保险公司报告更高的风险资本比率。采用修正共保的保险公司更少出现降级债券抛售现象。我们还发现监管套利的迹象——大多数修正共保交易要么来自资本要求较低国家的再保险人，要么发生在同一保险集团内部。
