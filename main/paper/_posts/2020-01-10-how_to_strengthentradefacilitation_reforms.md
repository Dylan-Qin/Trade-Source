The issue of trade facilitation has come to the fore since the inception of World Trade Organisation (WTO) to promote freer trade globally. As it reduces costs of trade including export and import, and thus enhances socio-economic benefits such as job creation and raising standard of life, Bangladesh needs to take it seriously for future gains. However, various stakeholders often find the issue of trade facilitation as ambiguous and it is important to have clear understanding of trade facilities for acting properly. The term 'trade facilitation' refers to simplification, harmonisation and automation of international trade procedures, particularly import and export procedures, transit requirements and procedures applied by customs and other agencies.

自世界贸易组织（WTO）成立以来，贸易便利化问题便成为推动全球贸易自由化的关键议题。由于它能降低包括进出口在内的贸易成本，从而提升如创造就业和提高生活水平等社会经济利益，孟加拉国需认真对待以获取未来收益。然而，各方利益相关者常认为贸易便利化概念模糊，清晰理解贸易便利措施对正确行动至关重要。"贸易便利化"这一术语指的是国际贸易程序——特别是进出口流程、过境要求及海关与其他机构实施的程序——的简化、协调与自动化。
