This paper provides a preliminary assessment of the compliance of national marketing regulation concerning genome-edited food products with international trade law. It presents an overview of global regulatory trends in this area and focuses on the compatibility of the diverging regulatory approaches with World Trade Organization (WTO) law, particularly the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) and the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT). Overall, the analysis finds significant potential for trade concerns under WTO law. As consumer choice is becoming the primary justification for labelling requirements, the focus of the assessment of NGT related measures will likely shift towards the TBT Agreement.

本文对涉及基因组编辑食品的国家营销法规与国际贸易法的合规性进行了初步评估。文章概述了该领域的全球监管趋势，重点分析了不同监管方式与世界贸易组织（WTO）法律（特别是《卫生与植物检疫措施协定》（SPS）和《技术性贸易壁垒协定》（TBT））的兼容性。总体而言，分析发现这些措施在WTO法律框架下存在显著的贸易争议风险。随着消费者选择逐渐成为标签要求的主要依据，针对新型基因组技术相关措施的评估重点可能会转向《技术性贸易壁垒协定》。
