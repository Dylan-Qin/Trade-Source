Trade facilitation could be defined in many ways but most prominent definition of the trade facilitation is adopted by the WTO i.e. the simplification and harmonization of international trade procedures, with trade procedures being the activities, practices and formalities involved in collecting, presenting, communicating and processing data required for the movement of goods in international trade. In other word “Trade Facilitation” refers to the simplification, harmonization and automation of international trade procedures, particularly import and export procedures, transit requirements and procedures applied by customs and other agencies. Implementing trade facilitation parameters could help a country to perform better in the Ease of Doing Business too.

贸易便利化可以有多种定义，但最主流的定义由世贸组织采用，即简化和协调国际贸易程序。这些程序涉及在国际贸易中货物流动所需数据的收集、提交、传递和处理等活动、惯例和手续。换言之，“贸易便利化”指的是国际贸易程序（特别是进出口程序、过境要求以及海关和其他机构实施的程序）的简化、协调和自动化。实施贸易便利化措施也有助于一个国家在营商环境便利度方面表现更佳。
