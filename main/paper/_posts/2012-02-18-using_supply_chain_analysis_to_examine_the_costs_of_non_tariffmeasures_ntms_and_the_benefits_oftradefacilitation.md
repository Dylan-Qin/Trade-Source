It has become increasingly common to produce goods in a number of geographically dispersed stages linked by international trade. This tendency, known by names such as “production fragmentation”, 'processing trade', and 'vertical specialization', has important implications for the analysis of non-tariff measures (NTMs) and trade facilitation. First, different types of NTMs or trade facilitation issues are naturally associated with different stages in the movement of goods. Different price gaps can be assigned to these stages, making it possible to decompose the overall amount of distortion and to prioritize the policies with the largest potential efficiency gains. Second, NTMs may accumulate in long supply chains, implying that their trade-distorting effects are greater for goods produced in a fragmented manner than for goods with simple production processes. There is evidence that trade costs are more important for high technology goods or goods undergoing several stages of processing. Issues with product standards may be particularly important for goods with long supply chains. The link between NTMs and supply chains also has implications for economic development and for the relationship between liberalization in services and goods.

通过国际贸易将地理上分散的多个生产阶段连接起来制造商品的做法已日益普遍。这种被称为“生产分割”、“加工贸易”或“垂直专业化”的趋势，对非关税措施（NTMs）和贸易便利化的分析具有重要意义。首先，不同类型的非关税措施或贸易便利化问题自然与商品流通的不同阶段相关联。可以将不同的价格差距分配到这些阶段，从而有可能分解总体扭曲程度，并优先考虑具有最大潜在效率提升的政策。其次，非关税措施可能在长供应链中累积，这意味着其对以分割方式生产的商品的贸易扭曲效应大于对生产流程简单的商品。有证据表明，贸易成本对高技术商品或经过多个加工阶段的商品更为重要。产品标准问题对于供应链长的商品可能尤为重要。非关税措施与供应链之间的联系还对经济发展以及服务与商品自由化之间的关系产生影响。
