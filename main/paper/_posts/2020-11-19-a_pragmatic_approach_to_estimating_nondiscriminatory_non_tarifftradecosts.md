Despite the growing importance of non-tariff measures (NTMs) in trade policy, many common methods for estimating their costs exhibit significant challenges in terms of data requirements or do not isolate the effects of specific NTMs. I propose an extension to existing approaches that mitigates these limitations. Following earlier work by Fontagné et al. (2011), I estimate a measure of the aggregate nondiscriminatory trade costs present in each country. Then, in a second stage, I econometrically decompose the estimated trade costs into individual components such as the costs associated with specific NTMs. Additionally, the second stage allows for the identification and removal of non-cost factors that erroneously contributed to the aggregate cost estimates. The methodology provides a means by which to estimate the effects of specific NTMs using widely available data and standard econometric techniques. I test the methodology using a typical gravity dataset and detailed NTM data. The results provide specific cost estimates for SPS measures and TBTs across many sectors and demonstrate that aggregate measures of non-discriminatory trade costs can significantly reflect non-cost factors.

尽管非关税措施（NTMs）在贸易政策中的重要性日益增长，但许多估算其成本的常用方法在数据需求方面存在显著挑战，或未能分离出特定非关税措施的影响。我提出对现有方法的扩展，以缓解这些局限性。借鉴Fontagné等人（2011年）的早期研究，我首先估算了各国存在的总体非歧视性贸易成本。随后在第二阶段，通过计量经济学方法将估算的贸易成本分解为具体组成部分，例如与特定非关税措施相关的成本。此外，第二阶段还能识别并剔除错误影响总体成本估算的非成本因素。该方法利用广泛可得的数据和标准计量经济学技术，为估算特定非关税措施的影响提供了途径。我使用典型引力模型数据集和详细的非关税措施数据对该方法进行了验证。研究结果给出了多个行业中SPS措施和技术性贸易壁垒（TBTs）的具体成本估算，并表明非歧视性贸易成本的总体衡量可能显著反映非成本因素。
