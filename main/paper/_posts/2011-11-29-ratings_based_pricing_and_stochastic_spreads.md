This paper generalizes a class of ratings-based credit derivative models proposed by Jarrow, Lando, and Turnbull (1997) and Kijima and Komoribayashi (1998) to allow for stochastic spreads and then applies this model to analyze empirically the pricing of large cross sections of corporate bonds and Asset Backed Securities. We show that measuring risk in credit portfolios is highly sensitive to the inclusion of randomness in spreads.

本文推广了由Jarrow、Lando和Turnbull（1997年）以及Kijima和Komoribayashi（1998年）提出的一类基于评级的信用衍生品模型，使其能够容纳随机利差，并应用该模型对大量公司债券和资产支持证券的定价进行实证分析。我们证明，信用组合的风险度量对利差随机性的纳入具有高度敏感性。
