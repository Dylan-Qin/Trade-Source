If you are still trying to Identify all the risks you are exposed to within the context of your business or spend endless hours converting historic data into useless risk reports in an effort to mitigate as much risk as possible for a green light on the road to taking less risk (for less reward); spending a fortune on controls and the digging of trenches for your lines of “defense”…. Fear no more!

如果您仍在努力识别业务中面临的所有风险，或花费无数时间将历史数据转化为无用的风险报告，只为在降低风险（从而减少回报）的道路上获得绿灯；花费巨资建立控制措施和构筑“防御”战线……那么无需再担忧了！
