Microinsurance can be a tool in Disaster Risk Reduction/Management - but only if it survives the disaster itself. Reinsurance can help microinsurance to survive disasters. However, reinsurers regard the microinsurance entity a risky client and are hesitant to engage in this market. An Integrated Risk Management approach can help a microinsurer to become a better client for reinsurance and thus to obtain reinsurance cheaper - or obtain it at all. However, Integrated Risk Management for microinsurance is insufficiently conceptualized so far. This paper takes a first step by providing examples of risks faced by microinsurance schemes and risk management techniques available to tackle them. It presents the Integrated Risk Management cycle and screens the business process of microinsurance for risks.

小额保险可以成为灾害风险降低/管理的工具——但前提是它能在灾害中存活下来。再保险能帮助小额保险抵御灾害。然而再保险公司将小额保险机构视为高风险客户，对该市场持谨慎态度。整合性风险管理方法能帮助小额保险机构成为更优质的再保险客户，从而以更低成本获得再保险保障——甚至实现从无到有的突破。但目前针对小额保险的整合性风险管理尚未形成完善的理论框架。本文通过列举小额保险计划面临的风险案例及应对这些风险的管理技术迈出研究第一步，阐述了整合性风险管理循环机制，并对小额保险业务流程中的风险进行了系统性筛查。
