Financial institutions are subject to many sources of risk, where risk often represents the degree of uncertainty about future net returns. Credit Risk can result in potential loss due to the inability of a counterparty to meet its obligations and is a function of the credit exposure, the probability of default and the loss in the event of default. For a given credit instrument portfolio of Credit obligations such as a portfolio of corporate bonds or swaps, Credit Value-at-Risk (VaR) quantifies how much at most can be lost with a given probability over a specific time horizon (Malhotra 2015). The associated CreditMetrics Methodology, originally introduced in 1997 by JP Morgan has become the “de facto industry standard” along with Credit VaR for credit risk modeling among global financial institutions as well as their regulators (Malhotra 2022). Described by Hull (2011 and 2012) as ‘a procedure for calculating credit value at risk’, CreditMetrics methodology (RiskMetrics Group, 2007) is used for assessing portfolio risk due to changes in bond or debt value caused by credit quality changes, including credit migration (upgrades and downgrades) as well as default. It measures the uncertainty in forward value of the bond portfolio at the risk horizon caused by such credit events. By distinguishing high quality well-diversified portfolios from low-quality concentrated portfolios, CreditMetrics offers better understanding of credit risk in terms of diversification benefits and concentration risk compared to standard capital adequacy measures.Pre-Print of the Journal Paper Submitted on Acceptance of Article for Journal Publication:Journal granted non-exclusive copyright to publish the article: Author retains all copyrights:Malhotra, Yogesh.

金融机构面临多种风险来源，其中风险通常代表未来净收益的不确定性程度。信用风险是指因交易对手无法履行义务而导致的潜在损失，其大小取决于信用敞口、违约概率以及违约时的损失程度。对于给定的信用工具组合（如公司债券或互换产品组合），信用风险价值（VaR）量化了在特定时间范围内以给定概率可能发生的最大损失（Malhotra 2015）。与之配套的CreditMetrics方法论由摩根大通于1997年首次提出，现已成为全球金融机构及其监管机构进行信用风险建模时与信用VaR并行的"事实行业标准"（Malhotra 2022）。Hull（2011和2012年）将其描述为"计算信用风险价值的程序"，该方法论（RiskMetrics Group，2007年）用于评估因信用质量变化（包括信用迁移（升级和降级）及违约）导致的债券或债务价值变动所产生的组合风险。它衡量了此类信用事件在风险期限内引发的债券组合远期价值不确定性。通过区分高质量分散化组合与低质量集中化组合，相较于标准资本充足率指标，CreditMetrics能从分散化收益和集中风险角度提供更深入的信用风险认知。期刊论文预印本（文章录用时提交）：期刊获得非独家版权以发表文章：作者保留所有版权：Malhotra, Yogesh.《计算信用VaR的CreditMetrics方法论框架》，IUP金融风险管理期刊。2022年9月第19卷第3期，38-49页。共12页。© 2022 Yogesh Malhotra博士版权所有，www.YogeshMalhotra.com。保留所有权利。
