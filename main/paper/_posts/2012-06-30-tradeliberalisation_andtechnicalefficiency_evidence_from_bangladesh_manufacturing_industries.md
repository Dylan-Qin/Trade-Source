The paper investigates the effects of trade liberalization on the technical efficiency of the Bangladesh manufacturing sector by estimating a combined stochastic frontier-inefficiency model using panel data for the period 1978–94 for 25 three-digit level industries. The results show that the overall technical efficiency of the manufacturing sector as well as the technical efficiencies of the majority of the individual industries has increased over time. The findings also clearly suggest that trade liberalization, proxied by export orientation and capital deepening, has had significant impact on the reduction of the overall technical inefficiency. Similarly, the scale of operation and the proportion of nonproduction labor in total employment appear as important determinants of technical inefficiency. The evidence also indicates that both export-promoting and import-substituting industries have experienced rises in technical efficiencies over time. Besides, the results are suggestive of neutral technical change, although (at the 5 per cent level of significance) the empirical results indicate that there was no technical change in the manufacturing industries. Finally, the joint test based on the likelihood ratio (LR) test rejects the Cobb-Douglas production technology as description of the database given the specification of the translog production technology.

该研究通过运用1978年至1994年间25个三位数级别行业的面板数据，构建随机前沿-低效组合模型，探讨了贸易自由化对孟加拉国制造业技术效率的影响。结果表明：制造业整体技术效率及多数细分行业技术效率均呈现随时间提升的趋势。研究明确显示，以出口导向和资本深化为代表的贸易自由化措施对降低整体技术低效率具有显著作用。运营规模与非生产性劳动力占比同样被证实是技术低效率的关键影响因素。数据还表明，无论是出口导向型还是进口替代型行业，其技术效率均随时间推移有所提高。尽管在5%显著性水平上实证结果显示制造业未发生技术变革，但研究结果仍暗示存在中性技术变化。最后，基于似然比检验的联合检验表明，在超越对数生产函数设定条件下，柯布-道格拉斯生产技术不能有效描述该数据库特征。
