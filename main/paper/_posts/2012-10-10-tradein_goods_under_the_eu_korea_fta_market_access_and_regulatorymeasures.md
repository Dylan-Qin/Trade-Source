This chapter deals with the rules on trade in goods in the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement. It is organized, as follows. First, the rules on market access, that is, the EU-Korea FTA provisions related to import measures applicable at the border, will be delineated and analyzed. Subsequently, aspects of one of the most innovative parts of the agreement will be examined in detail: the section containing rules on domestic regulation, in particular, on technical regulations and standards. This paper shows two sides of the EU–Korea FTA. On the one hand, it is a very traditional trade agreement, largely based on existing WTO provisions. This is particularly the case in those parts of the agreement concerning border measures. On the other hand, in particular, concerning the sector-specific rules on technical barriers to trade, the agreement is quite innovative and breaks new grounds, with respect to the regulation of domestic instruments. Moreover, the Agreement is, to a large extent, a ‘living instrument’. Many of the remaining lacunae in the field of domestic regulation must be dealt with in the future, through cooperation and consultations within the different committees and working groups. This is the Agreement’s approach to tackle its endogenous incompleteness, which is inherent in any trade agreement. From this angle, the EU–Korea FTA may not only be understood as a static body of rules, but also as a framework for collaboration that helps to find prompt and appropriate responses to changes in real-world conditions, thus facilitating trade relations between the parties in the long run.

本章探讨《欧盟-韩国自由贸易协定》中关于货物贸易的规则，内容安排如下：首先将界定并分析市场准入规则，即协定中与边境进口措施相关的条款。随后将详细研究该协定最具创新性的部分之一——涉及国内监管规则的内容，特别是技术法规与标准的相关规定。. . 本文揭示了《欧盟-韩国自贸协定》的双重特性。一方面，这是一份高度传统的贸易协定，其主要条款基于现行世贸组织规则，这在涉及边境措施的部分尤为明显。另一方面，该协定在技术性贸易壁垒的行业特定规则方面颇具创新性，为国内监管工具的规范开辟了新路径。此外，该协定在很大程度上属于"动态文件"，国内监管领域尚存的诸多空白需通过各委员会和工作组未来的合作与磋商来填补。这种机制正是协定应对其内生不完整性的解决之道——这种不完整性是所有贸易协定与生俱来的特质。. . 从这个角度看，《欧盟-韩国自贸协定》不仅可视为静态的规则体系，更是一个促进合作的框架。它有助于双方对现实条件变化作出迅速而恰当的应对，从而长远地巩固双边贸易关系。
