The risk for accidents in various situations, such as driving and operating heavy machinery. Therefore, the detection of drowsiness is crucial for ensuring safety and accident prevention. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing effective techniques for drowsiness detection. Among these, eye tracking-based techniques have emerged as a promising approach, as changes in eye movement patterns can serve as a significant indicators of drowsiness. This paper provides an overview of the current state of the art on eye tracking-based techniques for drowsiness detection. It summarizes the findings of several studies that have investigated the effectiveness of eye tracking-based techniques in detecting drowsiness. The findings suggest that eye tracking-based techniques can be a reliable and non-invasive techniques for detecting drowsiness in individuals. However, further research is needed to enhance the sensitivity of these techniques in detecting early warning signs of drowsiness in real-world scenarios. Overall, eye tracking-based techniques hold great potential for improving safety and preventing accidents in various contexts.

在不同情境下（如驾驶和操作重型机械时）发生事故的风险。因此，检测困倦状态对于确保安全和预防事故至关重要。近年来，开发有效的困倦检测技术受到越来越多的关注。其中，基于眼动追踪的技术因其能通过眼球运动模式变化作为困倦的重要指标，成为一种前景广阔的方法。本文概述了当前基于眼动追踪的困倦检测技术研究现状，汇总了多项探讨该技术有效性的研究成果。研究结果表明，基于眼动追踪的技术可以作为一种可靠且非侵入性的个体困倦检测手段。但需要进一步研究以提高这些技术在真实场景中检测早期困倦征兆的灵敏度。总体而言，基于眼动追踪的技术在提升多场景下的安全性和事故预防方面具有巨大潜力。
