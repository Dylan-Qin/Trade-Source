This research study comprehensively analyzes network intrusion detection in cloud environments by examining several approaches. These approaches have been explored and compared to determine the optimal and appropriate choice based on specific conditions. This research study employs a qualitative approach, specifically conducting a thematic literature analysis from 2020 to 2024. The research material has been exclusively obtained via Google Scholar. The traditional approaches identified in this research include anomaly-based and signature-based detection, along with innovative technologies and methods such as user behavior monitoring and machine learning. The findings of these studies demonstrate the effectiveness of conventional methods in known threat detection. They also struggle to identify novel attacks and understand the need for hybrid approaches that integrate the strengths of both. In this research study, the authors have addressed challenges such as privacy compliance, performance scalability, and false positives, highlighting the importance of continuous monitoring, privacy-preserving technologies, and real-time threat intelligence integration. This study also highlights the importance of stakeholder buy-in and staff training for the successful implementation of a network intrusion detection system (NIDS), especially when determining the evolving nature of cyber threats. This study concludes by defining a balanced approach combining new and old methodologies to offer an effective defense against diverse cyber threats in cloud environments. The future scope of NIDS in cloud environments has also been discussed, including enhancing privacy compliance capabilities and integrating AI-driven anomaly detection to meet emerging threats and regulatory requirements.

本研究全面分析了云环境中的网络入侵检测，通过考察多种方法进行探究。这些方法经过比较研究，旨在根据特定条件确定最优选择。研究采用定性方法，重点对2020至2024年的文献进行主题分析，所有研究资料均通过谷歌学术获取。研究发现传统方法包括基于异常和基于签名的检测，同时涵盖用户行为监控与机器学习等创新技术。研究结果表明传统方法在已知威胁检测中表现有效，但难以识别新型攻击，因此需要融合两者优势的混合方法。作者探讨了隐私合规、性能扩展和误报等挑战，强调持续监测、隐私保护技术和实时威胁情报整合的重要性。研究同时指出，在应对不断演变的网络威胁时，利益相关方支持与员工培训对成功部署网络入侵检测系统（NIDS）至关重要。最终提出新旧方法结合的平衡策略，为云环境多样化网络威胁提供有效防御。研究还展望了云环境NIDS的未来发展方向，包括提升隐私合规能力与整合AI驱动的异常检测，以应对新兴威胁和监管要求。
