The Agricultural Trade Policy Simulation Model (ATPSM) is designed of detailed analysis of agricultural trade policy issues. It can be used as a tool by researchers and negotiators alike for quantifying the economic effects at the global and regional level of recent changes in national trade policies. ATPSM is a deterministic, partial equilibrium, comparative static model covering 161 countries and 35 agricultural commodities. Features of the model include the extensive database, the distinction between bound and applied tariffs, and quota rents. Rents associated with two-tier tariff rate quotas are explicitly modelled within ATPSM. The model solution gives estimates of the changes in trade volumes, prices, government revenues and welfare indicators associated with changes in the trade policy environment. The model is distributed for free from UNCTAD's website. Instructions in the use of ATPSM are contained in this report. No prior knowledge of modelling or programming is required to install and run the model. The instructions cover use of the interface to set up scenarios and report the results, the model structure and the data.

农业贸易政策模拟模型（ATPSM）专为农业贸易政策问题的详细分析而设计。该模型可作为研究人员和谈判人员的工具，用于量化国家贸易政策近期变化对全球和区域层面的经济影响。ATPSM是一个确定性、局部均衡、比较静态模型，涵盖161个国家和35种农产品。模型特点包括庞大的数据库、约束关税与实施关税的区分以及配额租金。ATPSM明确模拟了双层关税配额相关的租金。模型解决方案可估算贸易政策环境变化带来的贸易量、价格、政府收入和福利指标的变化。该模型可从联合国贸发会议网站免费获取。本报告包含ATPSM的使用说明。安装和运行该模型无需具备建模或编程知识。说明内容包括使用界面设置场景和报告结果、模型结构及数据。
