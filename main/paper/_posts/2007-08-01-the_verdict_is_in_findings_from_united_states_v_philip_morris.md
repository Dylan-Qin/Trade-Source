On August 17, 2006, after six years of litigation, nine months of trial, hundreds of depositions and thousands of exhibits, U.S. District Court Judge Gladys Kessler ruled in United States v. Philip Morris that the U.S. Government had proven its case.  The court found that the tobacco company defendants violated the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) and engaged in a fifty-year conspiracy to defraud the American public and the world.  Specific remedies were ordered. The Verdict Is In: Findings from United States v. Philip Morris is a compilation of select quotes from 1,259 pages of findings in Judge Kessler's 1,700-page opinion. The final opinion is a masterpiece of legal scholarship: clear, thorough and compelling.  Its only shortcoming is its length.  With so much deceit to chronicle, the opinion is longer than a Russian novel.  Its heft alone is enough to deter most readers. Our goal in preparing this compilation has been to extract highlights of the court's findings that help tell the story in a direct and easily understandable way.  We have taken great care in quoting verbatim and in chronological order from the court's opinion, and in providing the original legal citations, footnotes, and court numbered paragraphs.  The publication contains seven sections that correspond with sections in the findings that address the hazards of smoking, addiction, nicotine levels, "light" cigarettes, marketing to youth, secondhand smoke, and the suppression of information.

2006年8月17日，经过六年诉讼、九个月庭审、数百份证词和数千件证据呈递，美国地方法院法官格拉迪斯·凯斯勒在美国诉菲利普·莫里斯案中裁定美国政府胜诉。法庭认定烟草公司被告违反《反诈骗腐败组织集团犯罪法》，实施了长达五十年的欺诈美国公众及全球消费者的阴谋，并下达了具体整改措施。《判决落定：美国诉菲利普·莫里斯案裁决精要》是从凯斯勒法官1700页判决书中1259页事实认定部分精选的语录汇编。这份终审判决堪称法学典范：清晰、详尽且令人信服，唯篇幅稍显冗长。为记录如此庞杂的欺诈行为，判决书厚度超越俄国小说，单是体积就足以令多数读者却步。本汇编旨在提炼法庭认定要旨，以直观易懂的方式呈现事件全貌。我们严格遵循判决书原文逐字引用，按时间顺序编排，并保留原始法律引证、脚注及法庭编号段落。全书七大章节对应判决书中关于吸烟危害、成瘾性、尼古丁含量、"淡味"香烟、青少年营销、二手烟及信息压制等核心问题的认定内容。
