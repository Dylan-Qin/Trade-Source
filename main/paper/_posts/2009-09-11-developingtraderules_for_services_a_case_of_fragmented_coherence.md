This paper presents the results of a four-year project tackling several issues relating to multilateral and preferential trade in services. One of the underlying organising principles of our research on services trade has been a presumed fault line between the innate coherence that is achieved through multilateral rules and commitments, on the one side, and the more inherently fragmented nature of preferential solutions or rules, on the other. Doubtlessly rooted in the way mainstream trade theorists and economists more broadly have long championed multilateralism over its peripheral brethren, such a perception proceeds from the assumed second-best nature of preferential, or non-WTO-centric, policy and rule-making approaches. Our key messages put forward concrete proposals to improve regulation of services trade. We find, inter alia, that: a) fragmentation is a source of policy and innovation apt to inform multilateral rule-making, while theatres at the periphery may yield superior outcomes or more politically palatable bargains; b) the adoption of a necessity test applicable across services sectors at the multilateral level would improve the quality of services trade regulation domestically; c) the current treatment of labour mobility under GATS is not conducive to an optimal global governance of migration; d) when examing likeness, both service-related and supplier-related factors have to be considered to decide whether there is competitive relationship in the marketplace; e) Overlapping multilateral and bilateral rules on investment blur the rights and obligations of domestic authorities and foreign investors in services; f) co-ordination between the WTO and arbitral panels so that similar principles are intepreted in a uniform manner can lead to a more coherent international investment framework in services.

本文展示了一项为期四年的研究成果，该项目致力于解决与服务领域多边及优惠贸易相关的若干问题。我们研究服务贸易的基本组织原则之一，是假定多边规则与承诺所达成的内在一致性，与优惠解决方案或规则固有的碎片化特性之间存在分界线。这种认知无疑源于主流贸易理论家及更广泛经济学界长期推崇多边主义而非边缘化替代方案的传统，其逻辑起点在于将优惠性或非WTO核心的政策规则制定路径视为次优选择。我们的核心主张提出了改进服务贸易监管的具体建议，主要发现包括：a) 碎片化现象能催生政策创新，为多边规则制定提供借鉴，而边缘化试验场可能产生更优成果或更易被政治接纳的妥协方案；b) 在多边层面实施跨服务部门的必要性测试将提升国内服务贸易监管质量；c) 现行GATS对劳动力流动的规制不利于实现全球移民治理的最优化；d) 判定市场竞争力关系时需同时考量服务特性与供应商特性；e) 多边与双边投资规则的重叠模糊了服务业中国内监管机构与外国投资者的权责边界；f) 通过WTO与仲裁庭的协调机制实现原则解释的一致性，可构建更连贯的国际服务业投资框架。
