This paper examines some of the perceived tensions between free trade and regulation of tobacco for health purposes and concludes that most of the concerns about trade and investment agreements undermining domestic regulation are unfounded and that special rules for tobacco are unnecessary. Free trade itself does not raise national sovereignty concerns, nor does it interfere with domestic policymaking to any significant degree. Although there may be valid concerns about some of the more recent additions to trade and investment agreements (i.e., rules that go beyond fighting protectionism), the core of these rules constrains domestic regulation only to the extent that such regulation discriminates against imports and does not preclude legitimate domestic policymaking.

本文探讨了自由贸易与出于健康目的对烟草进行监管之间的一些表面冲突，并得出结论：关于贸易和投资协定会削弱国内监管的多数担忧缺乏依据，针对烟草制定特殊规则并无必要。自由贸易本身不会引发国家主权关切，也不会对国内政策制定造成显著干扰。尽管对于贸易和投资协定中新增内容（即超出反保护主义范畴的规则）可能存在合理担忧，但这些规则的核心仅限制那些歧视进口产品的国内监管措施，并不妨碍正当的国内政策制定。
