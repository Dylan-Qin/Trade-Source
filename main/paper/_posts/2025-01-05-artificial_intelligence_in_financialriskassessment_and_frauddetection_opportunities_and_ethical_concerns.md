Financial risk assessment and fraud detection are being transformed by artificial intelligence (AI), which improves efficiency and accuracy. AI-driven systems can process massive amounts of financial data in real time using advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms and big data analytics to identify patterns and anomalies that indicate risks or fraud. Predictive models can analyze spending behavior, transaction history, and social data, improving credit risk assessments. Thus, financial institutions can make better lending decisions, lowering default rates and stabilizing portfolios. AI is also good at detecting unusual patterns that may indicate fraud. AI algorithms can continuously monitor transactions and flag those that deviate from norms or match fraud patterns. Banking and payments fraud losses have decreased due to this scrutiny, ensuring consumer and financial institution security. AI's adaptability lets it respond quickly to new fraud schemes, making it a valuable asset in a changing threat landscape. However, using AI for financial risk assessment and fraud detection raises ethical concerns. Model training with large datasets can lead to data privacy breaches and biases, especially if training data are unrepresentative or skewed. AI's "black box" opacity can make it hard for stakeholders to understand or challenge automated decisions, complicating accountability. AI-driven models may unintentionally discriminate against certain groups, raising lending and risk assessment fairness concerns. AI's opportunities must be balanced with transparency, fairness, and data protection. These ethical issues must be addressed to build trust and sustain AI's use in financial risk assessment and fraud detection.

人工智能（AI）正在改变金融风险评估和欺诈检测的方式，提升了效率和准确性。AI驱动的系统能够通过先进的机器学习（ML）算法和大数据分析实时处理海量金融数据，识别出预示风险或欺诈的模式与异常。预测模型可以分析消费行为、交易历史及社交数据，从而优化信用风险评估。这使得金融机构能够做出更明智的贷款决策，降低违约率并稳定资产组合。AI还擅长检测可能暗示欺诈的异常模式，其算法能持续监控交易，标记偏离常态或符合欺诈特征的交易。由于这种严密监控，银行和支付领域的欺诈损失得以减少，确保了消费者和金融机构的安全。AI的适应性使其能快速应对新型欺诈手段，成为动态威胁环境中的宝贵工具。  . . 然而，将AI用于金融风险评估和欺诈检测也引发了伦理问题。使用大规模数据集训练模型可能导致数据隐私泄露或偏见，尤其是当训练数据缺乏代表性或存在偏差时。AI的“黑箱”特性使得利益相关者难以理解或质疑自动化决策，从而模糊了责任归属。AI驱动的模型可能无意中对某些群体产生歧视，引发关于贷款和风险评估公平性的担忧。在利用AI机遇的同时，必须兼顾透明度、公平性和数据保护。只有解决这些伦理问题，才能建立信任，并确保AI在金融风险评估和欺诈检测领域的可持续应用。
