Using a sample of bank-years from 2005 to 2017, we examine the effect of internal control quality on future risk-taking and performance. We find that banks that disclose a material weakness in internal controls have higher risk-taking and worse performance in the future, including having a higher (lower) likelihood of experiencing large losses (gains). These findings suggest that weak controls increase (reduce) downside (upside) risk-taking or conversely that strong controls increase (reduce) upside (downside) risk-taking. Path analyses suggest that 22.3 to 43.7 percent of the effect of internal control quality on future performance is through risk-taking. Additionally, material weaknesses are negatively associated with total asset, loan, interest income, and non-interest income growth, suggesting that internal control quality affects both core and non-core activities of banks. Overall, results suggest that strong internal controls improve bank risk-taking, in part through asymmetrically reducing downside risk-taking while facilitating upside risk-taking, ultimately improving bank performance.

我们利用2005年至2017年的银行年度样本，研究了内部控制质量对未来风险承担和绩效的影响。研究发现，披露内部控制重大缺陷的银行在未来会承担更高风险且表现更差，具体表现为发生大额损失（收益）的概率更高（更低）。这些发现表明，薄弱的控制会增加（减少）下行（上行）风险承担，反之强有力的控制则会提升（抑制）上行（下行）风险承担。路径分析显示，内部控制质量对未来绩效的影响中有22.3%至43.7%是通过风险承担渠道实现的。此外，重大缺陷与总资产、贷款、利息收入及非利息收入的增长呈负相关，表明内部控制质量同时影响银行的核心与非核心业务。总体而言，研究结果表明强有力的内部控制能改善银行风险承担行为，其机制部分体现为不对称地抑制下行风险承担同时促进上行风险承担，最终提升银行绩效。
