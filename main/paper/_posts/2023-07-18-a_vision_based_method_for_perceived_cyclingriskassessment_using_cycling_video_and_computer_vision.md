Cycling risk assessment is important for promoting cycling, reducing accidents, and improving the cycling environment. The currently used cycling risk assessment methods are limited by their applicability and efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel vision-based cycling risk assessment method. Comparative results on the perceived risk of different cycling events in cycling videos were collected through a comparative survey. Using the Trueskill ranking system, the collected risk comparison results were converted into risk scores. Deep learning was applied to establish the mapping between risk scores and video data to achieve automatic cycling risk assessment. To achieve better model performance, a technology that simulates the human visual attention mechanism, salient object detection, was used to transform the video into forms that are more easily understood by the algorithm. Four models were developed based on different input forms: end-to-end model, saliency map-based model, feature parameter-based model and integrated model. The model results show that the introduction of the attention mechanism has effectively improved the model performance, and the model integrating saliency maps and event feature parameters achieves the best model performance, reaching a prediction accuracy of 0.8125 in the classification of three risk levels. The model could be implemented in the analysis of cycling videos to quickly and accurately assess the cycling risk.

骑行风险评估对于推广骑行、减少事故及改善骑行环境具有重要意义。当前使用的骑行风险评估方法受限于适用性和效率。为解决这些问题，本文提出了一种新型基于视觉的骑行风险评估方法。通过对比调查收集了骑行视频中不同骑行事件的风险感知对比结果，并利用Trueskill排名系统将收集到的风险对比结果转化为风险评分。应用深度学习建立风险评分与视频数据间的映射关系，以实现自动化的骑行风险评估。为获得更好的模型性能，采用模拟人类视觉注意机制的技术——显著目标检测，将视频转换为更易被算法理解的形式。基于不同输入形式开发了四种模型：端到端模型、基于显著图模型、基于特征参数模型和融合模型。模型结果表明，注意力机制的引入有效提升了模型性能，其中融合显著图和事件特征参数的模型取得了最佳性能，在三风险等级分类中预测准确率达到0.8125。该模型可应用于骑行视频分析，快速准确地评估骑行风险。
