Since trade liberalization started in earnest in the 1990s, conventional trade barriers, such as tariffs, have been dropping steadily worldwide. Under the WTO regime, member countries are unable to impose tariff higher than set rates, and effective tariff rates have been decreasing consistently as a result. In addition, the spread of multilateral and bilateral trade agreements has accelerated this phenomenon. It follows that many governments have begun to use non-tariff measures (NTMs), such as technological measures, standards, and intellectual property rights, as strategic trade policies. The variety and volume of NTMs have increased.According to Annex 1.2 of the WTO's TBT Agreement, "standards" refer to “document approved by a recognized body, that provides, for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for products or related processes and production methods, with which compliance is not mandatory.”Standards are intended primarily to improve the compatibility and quality of products and reinforce consumer protection, but may serve as de facto trade barriers that prevent foreign corporations from entering the domestic market and protect domestic businesses, whether the domestic governments intend it or not. The U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and Regulations (FMVSS) gives a good example of using standards as trade barriers. In most countries, vehicles are produced according to international safety standards called the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), which are accepted in just about every country in the world except the US and Canada. Foreign automakers, who already produce their products under UNECE and wish to export them to the U.S. and Canada, must satisfy the FMVSS and thus must modify their UNECE-compliance models. This then creates additional costs for the foreign firms, who already face stiff competition from American firms in the U.S. market.This paper models the effects of standards harmonization between countries with different technological capacities. Standards harmonization is effectively a way of eliminating standards as a NTM trade barrier.

自20世纪90年代贸易自由化真正开始以来，全球范围内的关税等传统贸易壁垒持续下降。在世贸组织框架下，成员国不得征收超过设定税率的关税，因此实际关税税率持续走低。此外，多边和双边贸易协定的普及加速了这一趋势。这使得许多政府开始将技术性措施、标准、知识产权等非关税措施（NTM）作为战略性贸易政策，其种类和数量与日俱增。. . 根据世贸组织《技术性贸易壁垒协定》附件1.2的定义，"标准"指"经公认机构批准的、规定产品或相关工艺和生产方法的规则、指南或特性的文件，要求共同和重复使用，其合规性并非强制"。标准的主要目的是提高产品兼容性和质量、加强消费者保护，但无论政府初衷如何，都可能成为事实上的贸易壁垒，阻碍外资企业进入国内市场并保护本土企业。. . 美国《联邦机动车安全标准与法规》（FMVSS）就是标准作为贸易壁垒的典型案例。多数国家采用联合国欧洲经济委员会（UNECE）制定的国际安全标准生产汽车，该标准被除美加以外的全球各国普遍接受。已按UNECE标准生产汽车的外国制造商若想出口美加市场，必须满足FMVSS要求，这意味着需对符合UNECE标准的车型进行改造。这给本就面临美国本土企业激烈竞争的外国车企增加了额外成本。. . 本文构建了技术能力存在差异的国家间标准协调效应模型。标准协调实质上是消除标准作为非关税贸易壁垒的一种方式。
