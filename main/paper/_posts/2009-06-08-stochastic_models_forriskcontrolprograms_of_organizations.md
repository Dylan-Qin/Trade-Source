Purpose - Risk control programs of modern complex organizations make extensive use of stochastic models. The present paper aims to consider a class of stochastic models in severity and risk duration reduction operations. Design/Methodology/Approach - A new stochastic model is formulated which is shown to be of some importance in fundamental risk management operations. The investigation of such a model is based on classical methods of characteristic functions theory. Findings - A stochastic model having the form of the product of two nonnegative and independent random variables is formulated. A characterization of the distribution of such a model is established. Moreover, applications of the proposed stochastic model in risk control programs of organizations are provided. Research limitations/implications - The difficulty of evaluating the corresponding distribution function, which extends the practical applicability of the proposed stochastic model still remains.   Originality/Value - The formulated stochastic model consists a strong analytical tool for investigating operations of risk control programs.
