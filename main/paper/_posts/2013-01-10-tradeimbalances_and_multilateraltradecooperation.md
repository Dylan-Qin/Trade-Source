Rising current account and merchandise trade imbalances marked the years before the global financial and economic crisis. These imbalances either contributed to or precipitated the crisis and to the extent that they create systemic risks, it is desirable that they be reduced. There are many factors related to macroeconomic, structural, exchange rate and financial policies that contributed to the imbalances. The inability to manage these issues at the international level reflects the “coherence gap” in global governance. This paper examines the contribution that the WTO can make in its three areas of activities — negotiations, rule-making and dispute settlement — to deal with trade imbalances and with the main factors leading to them, including exchange rate misalignments. First, market opening efforts in services, including in the area of financial services, can reduce policy-related distortions and market imperfections in surplus countries that lead to the build-up of unsustainable imbalances. Second, in the context of a broad international effort to coordinate macroeconomic, exchange rate and structural policies to deal with the roots of imbalances (the first-best solution), there is a general efficiency argument that could be made for the use of WTO-triggered trade actions to enforce cooperative behaviour towards rebalancing. Absent this first-best response, trade rules alone would not provide an efficient instrument to compensate for the weaknesses in international co-operation in macroeconomic, exchange rate and structural policies.

全球金融和经济危机爆发前的几年间，经常账户和商品贸易不平衡问题日益凸显。这些失衡现象要么加剧了危机，要么直接引发了危机。鉴于其可能引发系统性风险，降低失衡程度势在必行。导致失衡的因素众多，涉及宏观经济政策、结构性政策、汇率政策及金融政策等多个方面。国际层面无力解决这些问题，反映出全球治理存在"协调缺口"。本文探讨了世贸组织在其三大职能领域——谈判协商、规则制定和争端解决——能为应对贸易失衡及其主要诱因（包括汇率失调）作出何种贡献。首先，在服务领域（含金融服务）推进市场开放，有助于减少顺差国政策扭曲和市场缺陷，从而缓解不可持续失衡的累积。其次，在国际社会协调宏观经济政策、汇率政策和结构性政策以解决失衡根源（最优方案）的整体框架下，存在一个普遍效率论据：可运用世贸组织触发的贸易行动来推动各方采取合作性再平衡举措。若缺乏这种最优应对方案，仅靠贸易规则无法有效弥补国际间在宏观经济、汇率和结构性政策合作方面的不足。
