Machine learning and big data analytics are now part of stress testing and scenario analysis, sparking a noticeable shift in how banks handle risk. As financial markets get more tangled and risks loom larger, older methods just don’t cut it these days—generally speaking, they miss the mark on today's challenges. This essay looks into how newer, cleverer analytical techniques can ramp up both the accuracy and impact of risk assessments, helping institutions spot and dodge systemic problems more effectively. It also fits well with the growing push for banks to reinvent their risk management systems in light of changing regulations and environmental pressures (HUSEYNOV et al., 2024). Recent studies on hybrid risk cultures even point out that management teams view risk very differently, which shows why a one-size-fits-all approach simply won’t do (Ingram et al., 2014). All in all, this opening overview gets us ready to dive deeper into how machine learning and big data join forces to reshape financial risk management.

机器学习与大数据分析现已融入压力测试和情景分析领域，显著改变了银行处理风险的方式。随着金融市场日益复杂、风险不断加剧，传统方法已难以应对当前挑战——总体而言，这些方法无法满足当下需求。本文探讨了如何通过更智能的新型分析技术提升风险评估的准确性与影响力，助力机构更有效地识别和规避系统性风险。这也契合了监管要求与环境压力下银行重塑风险管理体系的迫切需求（HUSEYNOV等，2024）。关于混合风险文化的最新研究甚至指出，管理团队对风险的认知存在显著差异，这证明一刀切的方法根本行不通（Ingram等，2014）。总之，本概述为后续深入探究机器学习与大数据如何协同重塑金融风险管理奠定了基础。
