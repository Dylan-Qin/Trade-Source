As governments increasingly adopt policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, concern has grown on two fronts. First, carbon leakage can occur when mitigation policies are not the same across countries and producers seek to locate in jurisdictions where production costs are least affected by emission constraints. The risk of carbon leakage raises questions about the efficacy of climate change policies in a global sense. Secondly, it is precisely the cost-related consequences of differential mitigation policies that feed industry concerns about competitiveness. We thus have a link between environmental and competitiveness perspectives that fuses climate change and trade regimes in potentially problematic ways as governments contemplate trade actions to manage the environmental and/or competitiveness consequences of differential climate change policies. On the trade side of this relationship, we have the reality that the GATT/WTO rules were not originally drafted to accommodate climate change policies and concerns. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the relevance of certain WTO rules to the interface between climate change and trade, focusing in particular on border measures, technical regulations on trade, standards and labelling, and subsidies and countervailing duties. It concludes that in the absence of clear international understandings on how to manage the climate change and trade interface, we run the risk of a clash that compromises the effectiveness of climate change policies as well as the potential gains from specialization through trade.

随着各国政府越来越多地采取减少温室气体排放的政策，两方面的担忧日益加剧。首先，当各国的减排政策不一致时，可能导致碳泄漏现象——生产商会选择将业务迁往受排放限制影响最小的地区。碳泄漏风险引发了人们对全球气候变化政策有效性的质疑。其次，正是这种差异化减排政策带来的成本问题，引发了产业界对竞争力的担忧。因此，在环境与竞争力视角之间形成了某种联系，这种联系以可能存在问题的方式将气候变化与贸易体制捆绑在一起——当政府考虑采取贸易行动来应对差异化气候变化政策带来的环境和/或竞争力影响时。从贸易层面看，关贸总协定/世贸组织规则最初制定时并未考虑气候变化政策及相关问题。本文旨在分析某些世贸组织规则与气候变化和贸易交叉领域的关联性，重点探讨边境措施、贸易技术法规、标准与标签制度以及补贴与反补贴税等问题。研究结论表明，若国际社会未能就如何协调气候变化与贸易关系达成明确共识，我们可能面临双重风险：既会削弱气候变化政策的有效性，也可能丧失通过贸易专业化带来的潜在收益。
