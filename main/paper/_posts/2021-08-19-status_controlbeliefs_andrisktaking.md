We embed an experiment in a large-scale representative survey to investigate how relative wealth affects risk-taking and how this effect varies as a function of perceived control over life outcomes. Our results contest the common prediction of higher risk-taking in the middle of the distribution. Instead, we find that respondents who are induced to perceive their relative wealth as low display more tolerance towards risk in a subsequent incentivized risk-taking task. This effect is not uniform but is mainly driven by individuals who more firmly believe that life outcomes are beyond their control.

我们在一项大规模代表性调查中嵌入了一项实验，以研究相对财富如何影响风险承担行为，以及这种影响如何随个体对生活结果控制感的变化而变化。研究结果挑战了"风险承担行为在财富分布中间段达到峰值"的普遍预测。相反，我们发现那些被诱导认为自身相对财富较低的受访者，在后续激励性风险承担任务中表现出更高的风险容忍度。这种影响并非普遍存在，而主要由那些更坚信生活结果不受自身控制的个体驱动。
