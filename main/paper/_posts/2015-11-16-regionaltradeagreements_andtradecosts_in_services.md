This paper analyses the relationship between regional trade integration and trade costs in services industries. The empirical analysis relies, on the one hand, on a dataset of theory-consistent bilateral trade costs calculated for 61 countries over the period 2000-2011 and, on the other hand, on an analysis of services commitments in 66 regional trade agreements to which these countries are parties. Despite the proliferation of services RTAs in the past decade, we do not find significantly lower bilateral trade costs among countries having signed such agreements.  Several possible explanations are discussed. First, the gaps in services trade data and the difficulty to account for all modes of supply could influence our results. Second, the nature of services trade liberalisation makes it difficult to discriminate between domestic and foreign service providers (thus not impacting the relative costs they face). Third, there is no clear evidence that countries signing services RTAs do intend to create actual preferences for companies in partner countries. Services RTAs are about preferential “bindings”. Regionalism in the case of services seems non-discriminatory and does not lead to trade preferences.

本文分析了区域贸易一体化与服务行业贸易成本之间的关系。实证分析一方面基于2000-2011年间61个国家理论一致的双边贸易成本数据集，另一方面则通过分析这些国家参与的66个区域贸易协定中的服务承诺条款展开。尽管过去十年间服务类区域贸易协定激增，但我们并未发现签署此类协定的国家之间存在显著降低的双边贸易成本。研究探讨了若干可能原因：首先，服务贸易数据缺口及难以全面核算所有供应模式可能影响研究结果；其次，服务贸易自由化的特性导致难以区分国内外服务供应商（因而未改变其面临的相对成本）；第三，没有明确证据表明签署服务类区域贸易协定的国家确实有意为伙伴国企业创造实质性优惠。此类协定实质是关于优惠性"约束承诺"，服务领域的区域主义呈现非歧视性特征，并未形成贸易优惠效应。
