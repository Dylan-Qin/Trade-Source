Concerns about a possible turn of the global trade policy agenda are on the rise. Indeed, even if tariffs are at a historically low levels, non-tariff measures (NTMs) play an important – and growing – role in global trade policy. In this paper, using a recently released database on NTMs (UNCTAD), and relying on a gravity model, we focus on Chinese exports with two aims in mind: the first is to test for possible heterogeneous effects of different type of NTMs. The second is to verify empirically whether NTMs have larger negative effects for specific set of goods, i.e. final goods. We find that 1) technical NTMs tend to have positive effects on trade flows, whereas non-technical NTMs do not have clear effects at the aggregate level and 2) NTMs have heterogeneous effects at the product level: in the case of final goods, non-technical NTMs have negative and significant effects.

对全球贸易政策议程可能转向的担忧正在加剧。事实上，即便当前关税处于历史低位，非关税措施(NTMs)在全球贸易政策中正发挥着日益重要的作用。本文基于联合国贸发会议最新发布的非关税措施数据库，运用引力模型聚焦中国出口贸易，旨在实现双重目标：首先检验不同类型非关税措施可能存在的异质性影响，其次实证验证非关税措施是否对特定商品类别（如最终产品）产生更显著的负面效应。研究发现：1) 技术性非关税措施往往对贸易流量产生积极影响，而非技术性措施在总量层面未呈现明确效应；2) 非关税措施在产品层面存在异质性影响——针对最终产品时，非技术性措施会产生显著负面效应。
