Abstract: The increasingly busy maritime traffic system has resulted in frequent maritime accidents. To prevent maritime accidents, we investigated and studied typical cases of maritime accidents along the coast of China in recent years. Based on the complex network theory, a network model of China's coastal maritime traffic accidents is constructed from the four risk factors of human-ship-environmental-management. On this basis, the overall structural characteristics of the maritime accident network are analyzed according to the characteristic parameters of the complex network. In addition, based on the node betweenness and PageRank value, the network robustness analysis is carried out, the key factors in the maritime accidents are excavated and risk prevention and control measures are proposed. The research shows that the average path length of the marine traffic accident network is short, the clustering coefficient is high, and the risk spreads quickly in the network and passes through fewer nodes, which can lead to the occurrence of accidents. Through the management and control of key risk factors, the evolution of risks can be effectively blocked and the large and above maritime accidents can be reduced.

摘要：日益繁忙的海上交通系统导致海上事故频发。为预防海上事故的发生，对近年来我国沿海典型海上事故案例进行调查和研究，基于复杂网络理论，从人-船-环境-管理4个风险因素出发构建我国沿海海上交通事故网络模型。在此基础上，根据复杂网络的特征参数对海上事故网络的整体结构特征进行分析。此外，基于节点介数和PageRank值进行网络鲁棒性分析，挖掘海上事故中的关键因素并提出风险防控措施。研究表明，海上交通事故网络的平均路径长度较短，聚类系数较高，风险在网络中传播速度快且经过较少的节点即可导致事故的发生。通过对关键风险因素进行管控，可有效阻断风险的演化，减少较大及以上海上事故的发生。
