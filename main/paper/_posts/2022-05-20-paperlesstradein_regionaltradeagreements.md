We develop a comprehensive list of paperless trade measures and provisions in regional trade agreements (RTAs) and examine the extent to which they are featured in various RTAs, including in the TPP and ASEAN agreements. The number of paperless trade measures in RTAs is found to have doubled between 2005-8 and 2013-16 at the global level. Most recent RTAs contain more and deeper provisions than those featured in the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement. A more detailed analysis of paperless trade measures included in selected Asia-Pacific RTAs confirms that the coverage of RTAs of paperless trade issues has become extensive, covering increasingly specific areas such as electronic certificates of origins and sanitary and phytosanitary certificates. In that context, the new UN treaty and Framework Agreement on Facilitation of Cross-Border Paperless Trade in Asia and the Pacific can be expected to provide a useful tool for harmonized implementation of many of these provisions.

我们整理了一份区域贸易协定（RTAs）中无纸化贸易措施与条款的详尽清单，并考察了这些措施在各类RTA（包括TPP和东盟协定）中的体现程度。研究发现，全球范围内RTA中的无纸化贸易措施数量在2005-2008年与2013-2016年间翻了一番。最新签订的RTA大多包含比WTO《贸易便利化协定》更丰富、更深化的条款。对亚太地区部分RTA中无纸化贸易措施的细化分析表明，RTA对无纸化贸易议题的覆盖已非常广泛，涉及电子原产地证书、卫生与植物检疫证书等日益具体的领域。在此背景下，新出台的联合国《亚洲及太平洋跨境无纸贸易便利化框架协定》有望为协调实施这些条款提供有效工具。
