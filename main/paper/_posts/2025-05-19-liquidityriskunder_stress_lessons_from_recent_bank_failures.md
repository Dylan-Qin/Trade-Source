The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and the forced acquisition of Credit Suisse in 2023-2024 have reignited global concerns about the resilience of liquidity risk management in modern banking. These events exposed significant vulnerabilities in how liquidity stress is modeled, especially under rapid withdrawal scenarios amplified by digital banking and social media dynamics. This paper analyzes the sequence of events leading to these failures, evaluates the adequacy of current liquidity risk metrics, particularly the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) that highlights their limitations in capturing the speed and scale of stress outflows. Through a comparative case study and regulatory review, the research argues for recalibrating existing liquidity frameworks to incorporate behavioral triggers, nonlinear outflow patterns, and the systemic impact of depositor concentration. The findings advocate for a more dynamic and forward-looking approach to liquidity risk, combining traditional metrics with real-time analytics and digital risk indicators to enhance early warning capabilities and systemic resilience.

硅谷银行（SVB）的倒闭与2023-2024年间瑞士信贷被强制收购事件，再度引发全球对现代银行业流动性风险管理韧性的担忧。这些危机暴露出流动性压力建模存在重大缺陷——尤其在数字银行与社交媒体效应放大的快速挤兑情景下。本文通过剖析危机演变链条，评估现行流动性风险指标（着重分析流动性覆盖率LCR与净稳定资金比率NSFR）的适用性，揭示其难以捕捉资金外流速度与规模极限的弊端。基于案例比较与监管审视，研究主张重构现有流动性框架，纳入行为触发机制、非线性外流模式及存款集中度的系统性影响。结论指出应融合传统指标与实时分析、数字风险信号，构建更具动态性与前瞻性的流动性风险管理体系，以强化预警能力与系统抗压韧性。
