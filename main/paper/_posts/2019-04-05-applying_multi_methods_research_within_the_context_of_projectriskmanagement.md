The aim of this paper was to ascertain whether there is a relationship between complexity, maturity and competency in project risk management and if so, to create a sense-making framework for project managers to better understand the concept. . The multi-method research approach was employed to collect research data. An in-depth literature review was used to acquire data from six managers in the project risk management field. This was followed by a self-completion web-based survey that was forwarded to 207 project risk management practitioners. A checklist was applied to triangulate the interview and web-survey findings for further development of a framework. Multi-method analysis techniques were applied for the interpretation of the data sets from the interviews and responses to the web-based questionnaire namely, thematic and content analysis. The outcome of the research is the production of a sense-making framework and recommendations for enhanced project risk management. The research for this paper was based on information from the original doctoral thesis.

本文旨在确定项目风险管理中的复杂性、成熟度与能力之间是否存在关联，并据此构建一个意义构建框架，以帮助项目经理更好地理解这一概念。研究采用多方法研究途径收集数据：首先通过深度文献综述获取六位项目风险管理领域管理者的访谈数据，随后向207名项目风险管理从业者发放了自填式网络问卷。研究运用核查清单对访谈和网络调查结果进行三角验证，以进一步完善框架构建。数据分析采用多方法分析技术（主题分析与内容分析）对访谈记录和网络问卷反馈进行解读。最终成果包括一个意义构建框架及优化项目风险管理的建议。本研究基于原始博士论文中的信息展开。
