Services have long been perceived as playing a secondary role in world trade. In particular, the role of services trade policies and multilateral services commitments often tends to be downplayed. However, in value added terms, services account for about 50% of world trade and are significant in exports of countries of all levels of development. In addition, cross-border trade is expanding as a result of technological advances, and the supply of services by foreign affiliates (mode 3) exceeds trade through other modes of supply. Services trade policies, which cover a wide range of 'inside-the-border' measures, are an important determinant of foreign direct investment, economy-wide productivity, manufacturing competitiveness and exports, and flows of services value added.This paper underscores, on the basis of recent services data and a growing body of research on the impact of services policies, the role of services trade in economic development, trade integration, and inclusiveness. It argues that the limited attention given to services trade policies and to international commitments is increasingly out of step with the role of services in the global economy. Indeed, services trade policies are often restrictive and multinational commitments are generally modest. Taking steps to raise the profile of services trade within government policy-making would help close this gap and highlight the contribution of services trade policy to a wide range of broader national objectives that have an important services dimension, whether SME and gender policy, or the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

长期以来，服务业在世界贸易中的角色被视为次要。特别是服务贸易政策和多边服务承诺的作用常被低估。然而，从增值角度看，服务业约占全球贸易的50%，对各国出口都具有重要意义。此外，技术进步推动跨境贸易扩展，外国附属机构提供的服务（模式3）已超越其他供应模式。服务贸易政策涵盖广泛的"境内措施"，是影响外国直接投资、整体经济生产率、制造业竞争力及出口、以及服务增值流动的关键因素。本文基于最新服务数据及日益增多的服务政策影响研究，强调服务贸易在经济发展、贸易一体化和包容性方面的作用，指出当前对服务贸易政策及国际承诺的有限关注与服务业在全球经济中的地位日益脱节。事实上，服务贸易政策往往限制较多，多边承诺普遍保守。提升服务贸易在政府决策中的地位将有助于弥合这一差距，并凸显服务贸易政策对诸多国家宏观目标的贡献——无论是中小企业与性别平等政策，还是实现可持续发展目标（SDGs），这些领域都包含重要的服务维度。
