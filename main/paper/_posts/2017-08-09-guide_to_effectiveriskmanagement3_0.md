Nowadays, risk management is on everyone’s corporate agenda; let it be a private or public organisation. A special attention to risk management is paid by governments, stock exchanges, shareholders and regulators. However, this hasn’t always been the case. We began our risk management research back in 2007. This was the time when most large non-financial corporations were just starting to build risk management functions and implementing risk management frameworks. At the time, our study showed that risk management was largely driven by the stock exchange requirements and was very basic in nature. Today, as we continue to adapt to a highly volatile environment, businesses are becoming more proactive about risk management. Is this just a facade or are organisations truly becoming more risk aware? During our research, we were pleasantly surprised by how many companies have already recognized the limitations of “stand-alone” and “separate” risk management processes and are proactive in integrating risk management into decision-making, core business processes and the overall culture of the organisation. We have collated best practices from more than a dozen mature organisations to propose an alternative approach to risk management. An approach without the heat maps, risk registers, risk frameworks or risk mitigation plans. For several years, we have tested and validated the findings both locally and internationally. Based on our research and the interviews, we have summarized fifteen practical ideas on how to improve the integration of risk management into the daily life of the organisation. These were grouped into three high level objectives: drive risk culture, help integrate risk management into business and become a trusted adviser. This document is designed as a practical implementation guide. We recommend using it as such. Each section is accompanied by checklists, video references, useful links and templates.

如今，风险管理已成为所有企业的核心议题，无论是私营还是公共机构。政府、证券交易所、股东和监管机构都对风险管理给予了特别关注。但情况并非一直如此。我们自2007年便开始了风险管理研究，彼时多数大型非金融企业才刚刚着手建立风险管理职能并实施管理框架。当时研究表明，风险管理主要由证券交易所要求驱动，本质仍非常基础。如今随着企业持续适应高度波动的环境，它们对风险管理的态度正变得更加主动。这究竟是表面功夫，还是组织真正提升了风险意识？研究过程中，我们惊喜地发现，许多企业已认识到"孤立"和"割裂"式风险管理流程的局限性，正积极将风险管理融入决策、核心业务流程和组织文化中。我们汇总了十余家成熟机构的最佳实践，提出了一种创新的风险管理方法——摒弃热力图、风险登记册、管理框架或缓解计划的方法论。通过多年本土与国际验证，基于研究和访谈，我们提炼出十五项将风险管理融入组织日常的实用建议，归纳为三大目标：推动风险文化、助力业务融合、成为可信顾问。本文件是实践指南，建议按需使用。每个章节均附检查清单、视频参考、实用链接和模板工具。
