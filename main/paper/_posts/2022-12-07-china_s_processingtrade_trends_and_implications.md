China, the largest trading partner of Korea, is emerging as a key player in the world economy. However, China’s processing trade is not emphasized despite its role and importance due to the wrong perception concerning processing trade. Only low value-added products are associated with processing trade, which is thought to decay in the near future. However, in China-Korea trade, the proportion of processing trade is high (nearly half), and it is concentrated in high value-added industries such as electronics.Therefore, it is expected to continue in the future. In the early days, the processing trade of China was concentrated in labor-intensive items, but with foreign-funded enterprises and related R&D expansion, the proportion of technology-intensive items such as electronics and machinery increased gradually. This contributed to the enhancement of the overall technology level of China. There is an assessment that contributes towards relieving the unemployment problem in China. However, still a significant portion of the processing trade consists of the simple processing and assembling stages.The high portion of simple processing trade is an obstacle to the advancement of industrial structure and China’s own brand value. As part of the background to these discussions, the Chinese government has been expanding the scope of the processing trade restrictions continuously to promote the advancement of the domestic industry since 1999. However, as part of the economic stimulus package to offset the impact of the global financial crisis, processing trade restrictions were eased in 2009.Along with the recovery of the world economy in 2010, the Chinese government is again expanding the scope of the restrictions. It is expected that more prohibited items for processing trade will be added, which will be a burden for related industries. In this study, we provide strategic implications for Korea’s approach to China by analyzing the structural changes and related policy changes in China. In particular, this paper attempts to analyze the industrial processing trade between Korea and China by using China Custom trade data.

中国作为韩国最大的贸易伙伴，正在世界经济中扮演关键角色。然而，由于对加工贸易存在认知误区，其作用和重要性未得到充分重视——人们往往将加工贸易与低附加值产品挂钩，并认为其即将衰退。但中韩贸易中加工贸易占比高达近半数，且集中于电子等高附加值产业，因此预计未来仍将持续发展。早期中国加工贸易以劳动密集型产品为主，随着外资企业入驻及相关研发投入扩大，电子、机械等技术密集型产品比重逐步提升，这对中国整体技术水平的提高产生了积极影响。有评估认为加工贸易对缓解中国就业压力具有贡献，但目前仍存在大量简单加工组装环节。这种高比例的简单加工贸易阻碍了产业结构升级和中国自主品牌价值提升。作为政策背景，中国政府自1999年起持续扩大加工贸易限制范围以促进国内产业升级，但2009年为应对全球金融危机冲击放宽了限制。随着2010年世界经济复苏，中国政府再次扩大限制范围，预计未来将新增更多加工贸易禁止类目，这将对相关产业造成压力。本研究通过分析中国加工贸易结构变化及相关政策调整，为韩国对华策略提供战略启示。特别地，本文尝试运用中国海关贸易数据对中韩产业加工贸易进行实证分析。
