African swine fewer (ASF) is a serious disease present in Africa, Eurasia, and the Caribbean but continental North America. CanSpotASF describes the ASF surveillance in Canada as a phased in approach. The first enhancement to the surveillance was the risk-based early detection testing (rule-out testing) where eligible cases were tested for ASF virus (ASFv)v. The objective was to describe how the eligibility criteria were applied to cases in western Canada. In particular, to assess if cases tested for ASF had eligible conditions and if cases with eligible conditions were tested for ASF based on the data collated by Canada West Swine Health Intelligence Network (CWSHIN) from British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.We found that over 90% of cases tested for ASFv had eligible conditions as defined in CanSpotASF and the relative risk (RR) of an ASF rule-out test when a case was eligible was 8.45 (5.90, 12.12). The eligibility criteria were applied at three stages of the disease investigation process: 1) the clinical presentation in the herd; 2) at the initial laboratory assessment; and 3) the final pathology diagnosis. A limitation was that not all information on an eligible case was available in the data.We concluded that the selection of cases for ASF rule-out testing was based on the CanSpotASF eligible conditions and that the CanSpotASF rule-out testing could be described as risk-based surveillance where health was the defining factor.

非洲猪瘟（ASF）是一种存在于非洲、欧亚大陆和加勒比地区但北美大陆尚未出现的严重疾病。CanSpotASF将加拿大的ASF监测描述为分阶段实施的方法。监测的第一项改进是基于风险的早期检测测试（排除测试），对符合条件的病例进行ASF病毒（ASFv）检测。目的是描述如何将资格标准应用于加拿大西部的病例。特别是根据加拿大西部猪健康情报网络（CWSHIN）从不列颠哥伦比亚省、阿尔伯塔省、萨斯喀彻温省和马尼托巴省整理的数据，评估接受ASF检测的病例是否符合条件，以及符合条件的病例是否接受了ASF检测。我们发现，超过90%接受ASFv检测的病例符合CanSpotASF定义的条件，且当病例符合条件时，进行ASF排除测试的相对风险（RR）为8.45（5.90，12.12）。资格标准在疾病调查过程的三个阶段应用：1）猪群的临床表现；2）初步实验室评估；3）最终病理诊断。一个局限性是并非所有符合条件的病例信息都在数据中提供。我们得出结论，选择进行ASF排除测试的病例基于CanSpotASF的资格条件，且CanSpotASF的排除测试可描述为基于风险的监测，其中健康状况是决定性因素。
