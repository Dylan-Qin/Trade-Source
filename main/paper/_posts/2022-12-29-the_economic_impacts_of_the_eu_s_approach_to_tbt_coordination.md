The use of the traditional trade barriers, such as tariffs and quotas, has become less common over the last two decades due to the expansion of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) regime. Yet, at the same time there has been a notable increase in the use of non-tariff measures (NTM) for many products in most countries. In this environment, technical barriers to trade (TBT)—a sub-category of NTM and one of the main obstacles to trade—are crucial factors firms must take into consideration when exporting goods. Since Korea relies largely on exports for economic growth, it is necessary for the government to understand the economic impact of TBT.One of the main objectives of the EU is to prevent the erection of trade barriers within its borders. It follows that the coordination of technical regulations among EU member states is of a vital importance. The EU currently employs two main approaches to coordination : Harmonization (HR) and Mutual Recognition (MR). In harmonized fields, all member states agree to adopt uniform technical regulations.The European Union is Korea’s third-largest trading partner by volume, after China and the U.S. In addition, it plays a leading role in the design and implementation of new TBT that are consequently adopted by many other countries. In this paper, I analyze the impact of the EU’s TBT on Korean exports. In particular, I study the impact under the EU’s various approaches to removing TBT among member countries.

过去二十年间，由于《关税与贸易总协定》（GATT）体系的扩展，关税和配额等传统贸易壁垒的使用已逐渐减少。然而与此同时，多数国家对众多产品采取的非关税措施（NTM）却显著增加。在此背景下，作为非关税措施子类目和主要贸易障碍之一的技术性贸易壁垒（TBT），成为企业出口商品时必须考量的关键因素。由于韩国经济增长高度依赖出口，政府有必要理解技术性贸易壁垒的经济影响。欧盟的主要目标之一是防止其内部设立贸易壁垒，因此成员国间技术法规的协调至关重要。欧盟目前采用两种主要协调方式：统一化（HR）与相互认可（MR）。在统一化领域，所有成员国同意采用完全一致的技术法规。欧盟是韩国继中国和美国之后的第三大贸易伙伴，同时在新技术性贸易壁垒的设计与实施方面发挥着主导作用，这些壁垒随后被众多其他国家采纳。本文分析了欧盟技术性贸易壁垒对韩国出口的影响，重点研究了欧盟采用不同方法消除成员国间技术性贸易壁垒时所产生的效应。
