Malware is a computer program developed with the intent of disrupting, stealing, and compromising a computer system. In recent advances in technology and internet use, malware has become the major problem in computer society. In this research, an optimal K-nearest Neighbor (KNN) based malware detection and classification model is proposed. The proposed malware detection model is based on application programming interface (API) call sequence analysis and classification. The dataset is collected from an online Kaggle data repository which consists of 42,797 malicious application programming interface (API) call sequences and 1,079 non-malicious application programming interface (API) call sequences. The Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm is applied to the dataset to create a model that detects malware. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed KNN based malware detection model is evaluated, and the result shows that the accuracy of 98.17% is achieved in the detection of malware using the model. The proposed model is significantly essential for detecting real-time intrusion on computer systems.

恶意软件是一种为破坏、窃取和危害计算机系统而开发的程序。随着技术进步和互联网使用的普及，恶意软件已成为计算机社会的主要问题。本研究提出了一种基于K最近邻（KNN）算法优化的恶意软件检测与分类模型。该检测模型通过分析应用程序编程接口（API）调用序列实现分类功能，数据集采集自Kaggle在线仓库，包含42,797条恶意API调用序列和1,079条非恶意API调用序列。应用K最近邻算法构建检测模型后，经评估显示该模型检测准确率达98.17%。该模型对实时检测计算机系统入侵具有重要应用价值。
