Digital trade has become a major driver of economic development by enhancing productivity and lowering costs of trade in goods. While digital trade promises new opportunities for individuals and firms of all sizes, it also raises new challenges. Policymakers and business leaders need to better understand the drivers of this paradigm for trade and find solutions for potential issues in dialogue with stakeholders so as to ensure digital trade policies that are more sustainable and inclusive for all. This paper addresses emerging topics, with limited existing regulations in place and with clear challenges ahead in designing effective and appropriate policy responses that effectively address each topic. The risks of incompatible policy frameworks across the Asia-Pacific region cannot be discounted. Such regulatory fragmentation could destroy the promise of the digital economy and make it significantly harder for large and small firms across the region to participate in digital trade in the future.

数字贸易通过提升生产效率和降低商品贸易成本，已成为经济发展的主要驱动力。尽管数字贸易为各类规模的企业和个人带来了新机遇，但也带来了新挑战。政策制定者和商业领袖需要更好地理解这一贸易模式的驱动因素，并与利益相关方共同探讨潜在问题的解决方案，以确保数字贸易政策更具可持续性和包容性。本文探讨了现有法规有限、且在制定有效且适当的政策应对措施方面面临明显挑战的新兴议题。亚太地区政策框架不兼容的风险不容忽视。这种监管碎片化可能会破坏数字经济的潜力，并大幅增加该地区大小企业未来参与数字贸易的难度。
