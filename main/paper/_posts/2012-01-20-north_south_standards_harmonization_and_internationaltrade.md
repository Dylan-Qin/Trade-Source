Recent years have seen a surge in regional trade agreements (RTAs) and the development of non-tariff measures (NTMs). As a consequence, a growing number of RTAs include provisions on NTMs. This paper investigates the effect of standards-harmonization clauses contained in many North-South Agreements on international trade. Using a gravity equation, we find that (i) North-South harmonization of technical regulations reinforces a hub-and-spoke trade structure potentially detrimental to the development of South-South trade and (ii) harmonization on regional standards hurts Southern exports to the North. Thus, standards-harmonization provisions included in many recent North-South RTAs miss their target and contribute to marginalize Southern countries in the world economy.

近年来，区域贸易协定（RTAs）数量激增，非关税措施（NTMs）也持续发展。其结果是越来越多的区域贸易协定开始纳入非关税措施条款。本文研究了众多南北协定中的标准协调条款对国际贸易的影响。通过引力模型分析，我们发现：（一）南北技术法规的协调强化了"中心-辐条"式贸易结构，可能阻碍南南贸易的发展；（二）采用区域标准进行协调会损害南方国家对北方的出口。因此，当前诸多南北区域贸易协定中的标准协调条款未能实现预期目标，反而加剧了南方国家在世界经济中的边缘化地位。
