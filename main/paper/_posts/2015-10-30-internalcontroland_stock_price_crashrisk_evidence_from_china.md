This paper examines the role played by internal control and its five components (i.e., control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring) in alleviating future stock price crash risk. Using a unique dataset from China, we find evidence that internal control is negatively associated with future stock price crash risk. Specifically, control environment and monitoring are significantly and negatively associated with future stock price crash risk. Moreover, the negative association between internal control and crash risk is significantly more pronounced in firms with weak internal and external governance (i.e., audited by non-Big 4 auditors, located in provinces with low market development, and less conservative in accounting) and with poor ability to mitigate impacts of extreme negative events (i.e., non-state-owned enterprises). Our study highlights the delicate role of internal control as a mechanism in preventing crash of stock price.

本文探讨了内部控制及其五大要素（即控制环境、风险评估、控制活动、信息与沟通、监督）在缓解未来股价崩盘风险中的作用。基于中国独特数据集，我们发现内部控制与未来股价崩盘风险呈负相关。具体而言，控制环境和监督要素与未来股价崩盘风险存在显著负向关联。此外，在内外治理薄弱（即非四大审计、市场发展水平较低地区、会计政策较不保守）及极端负面事件应对能力较差（即非国有企业）的企业中，内部控制与崩盘风险的负向关联更为显著。本研究揭示了内部控制作为防范股价崩盘机制的精妙作用。
