Tobacco manufacturers have targeted youth for decades in the marketing of tobacco products.  Their continuation of such practices, despite the prohibition against youth marketing under the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (“MSA”) between state attorneys general and the five largest tobacco manufacturers, does not come as a surprise to many public health and tobacco control advocates.  Since the signing of the MSA, state attorneys general have investigated and prosecuted numerous violations.  Still, the brazen approach some manufacturers have taken to market candy and fruit-flavored tobacco products in a manner that targets youth is astounding.  This law synopsis explores legal approaches for addressing the marketing and sale of flavored tobacco products to youth.  Section I describes various types of flavored tobacco products and reviews current evidence that the marketing of these products, as well as the products themselves, target youth.  Internal tobacco industry documents provide some answers as to why manufacturers have developed these new products.  Section II introduces one possible legal approach, MSA enforcement.   Section III focuses on legislative initiatives, such as Food and Drug Administration oversight of tobacco products, and state legislative initiatives, with particular attention paid to the State of Maine’s law prohibiting the sale of flavored cigarettes, which took effect January 1, 2009.  The experiences involved in passing the Maine Law provide an initial model for public health law development in this area.  Section III concludes with recommendations for refining the Maine Law.  It should be noted that although the design and marketing of menthol tobacco products may also increase youth smoking rates, this synopsis focuses on the less traditional flavored cigarettes, including candy, fruit and alcohol-flavored tobacco products. Editor’s Note:  This publication was prepared in February 2009, prior to the June 2009 passage of the Family Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, giving the U.S. Food and Drug Administration comprehensive authority to regulate the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of tobacco products.  Under this Act, cigarettes that contain flavors other than tobacco or menthol may not be sold, distributed or manufactured in the U.S., effective September 22, 2009.

烟草制造商数十年来一直将青少年作为烟草产品的营销目标。尽管1998年各州总检察长与五大烟草制造商达成的《总和解协议》（MSA）禁止针对青少年的营销行为，但许多公共卫生和控烟倡导者对这些企业继续此类做法并不感到意外。自MSA签署以来，州总检察长已调查并起诉了多起违规案件。然而，某些制造商肆无忌惮地通过糖果和水果味烟草产品针对青少年进行营销的手段仍令人震惊。本法律概要探讨了解决向青少年营销和销售调味烟草产品的法律途径。第一部分描述了各类调味烟草产品，并回顾了当前证据，表明这些产品的营销手段及产品本身均以青少年为目标。烟草业内部文件为制造商开发这些新产品的原因提供了一些答案。第二部分介绍了MSA执法这一可能的法律途径。第三部分聚焦立法举措，包括美国食品药品监督管理局对烟草产品的监管及各州立法行动，其中特别关注缅因州自2009年1月1日起生效的禁止销售调味香烟法律。缅因州立法过程中的经验为该领域公共卫生法律的发展提供了初步范本。第三部分最后提出了完善缅因州法律的建议。需要说明的是，虽然薄荷味烟草产品的设计和营销也可能提高青少年吸烟率，但本概要主要关注非传统口味的香烟，包括糖果味、水果味和酒味烟草产品。编者注：本出版物完成于2009年2月，早于2009年6月通过的《家庭预防与烟草控制法》。该法案授权美国食品药品监督管理局全面监管烟草产品的生产、营销和销售。根据该法案，自2009年9月22日起，美国禁止销售、分销或生产含有烟草或薄荷以外口味的香烟。
