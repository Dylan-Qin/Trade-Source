This is an era of globalization. The World Trade Organization (WTO) is working hard to ensure free movement of goods and services across the world. No country of the world is self-sufficient; everyone has some advantages and disadvantages. People once used to share their strengths and weaknesses with others for the sake of peaceful living. The modern system of this sharing is multilateral trading system under the umbrella of WTO or regional trade agreement like the EU, ASEAN, SAFTA, APTA, etc. As multilateral trade negotiation in the WTO is getting delayed because of so many issues, countries are moving to regional free trade arrangements, even bilateral free trade arrangements, to make to process quicker. With the same end in view, Bangladesh-Myanmar Joint Trade Commission (JTC) was formed in 2003 to promote mutual trade and investment among us. In the meantime, two meetings of this JTC were held and some very important trade related issues were initiated in those meetings. But until now, none of the issues has been finalized. We must remember that, in this age of ITC, no opportunity will wait for any one. If someone fails to take the opportunity in time, we must see that it has been taken by any other else. The problems and issues involved in Bangladesh-Myanmar trade negotiation are about: L/C opening Transportation. Mutual exchange of gas and fertilizer issue. Contract Farming Increasing market access of Bangladeshi products into Myanmar. Border market and trade exhibition, etc.

这是一个全球化的时代。世界贸易组织（WTO）正致力于确保商品和服务在全球范围内的自由流动。世界上没有一个国家能自给自足，每个国家都有其优势和劣势。人们曾为了和平共处而互相分享各自的长处与不足。如今，这种共享的现代体系便是WTO框架下的多边贸易体系，或是如欧盟、东盟、南亚自由贸易协定（SAFTA）、亚太贸易协定（APTA）等区域贸易协定。由于WTO多边贸易谈判因诸多问题而进展缓慢，各国正转向区域自由贸易安排，甚至双边自由贸易安排，以加快进程。出于同样的目的，孟加拉国与缅甸于2003年成立了联合贸易委员会（JTC），旨在促进双方贸易与投资。期间，该委员会已召开两次会议，并就一些重要贸易议题展开讨论。但至今尚未有任何议题最终敲定。我们必须牢记，在这个信息通信技术（ITC）时代，机遇不等人。若有人未能及时把握机会，我们只能眼睁睁看着它被他人夺走。孟加拉国与缅甸贸易谈判涉及的问题包括：信用证开立、运输、天然气与化肥的互供、订单农业、扩大孟加拉国产品在缅甸的市场准入、边境市场及贸易展览会等。
