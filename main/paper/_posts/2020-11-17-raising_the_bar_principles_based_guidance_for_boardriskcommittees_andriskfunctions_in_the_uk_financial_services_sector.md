The Risk Coalition, a newly created association of the UK’s leading professional membership bodies, has produced principles-based guidance aimed at improving risk governance and oversight in the UK financial services sector. Raising the Bar will provide boards, investors, regulators, ratings agencies, Skilled Persons firms and other stakeholders with a commonly agreed benchmark for “what good looks like” – something not previously available in one place.“Nothing like this currently exists in Europe.” Martin Stewart, former Director of Banking and Building Society Supervision, Prudential Regulation Authority.The Risk Coalition’s aims in producing Raising the Bar are to close major gaps in risk governance and oversight, initially in the UK financial services sector, through:establishing a common understanding of the purpose, role and activities of the board risk committee and risk function; providing a benchmark against which board risk committees and risk functions can be assessed objectively; raising the general standard of risk governance and oversight practice within UK financial services; filling the gap in principles-based good practice risk guidance whilst recognizing the presence of detailed regulation. Raising the Bar’s focus on alignment of organisation purpose, strategy, objectives and risk should lead to the repositioning of the board risk committee as the pre-eminent board committee with a direct influence on overall business performance.Moreover, the Risk Coalition expects that Raising the Bar will encourage increased use of board risk committees, beyond financial services, through clarification of their purpose and ability to add value. Effective risk governance is crucial to sustainability and viability.“We welcome the Risk Coalition’s initiative to raise standards in risk oversight in UK financial services. Their approach and guidance complements the personal accountability we regard as an important regulatory objective.” Financial Conduct Authority.“We welcome the initiative and particularly support your emphasis on improving standards of accountability of the Board and its committees on risk.” Financial Reporting Council.

英国新成立的领先专业会员机构联盟“风险联盟”（The Risk Coalition）发布了一份基于原则的指导文件，旨在提升英国金融服务行业的风险治理与监督水平。《提高标准》（Raising the Bar）将为董事会、投资者、监管机构、评级机构、专业评估公司及其他利益相关方提供关于"良好实践标准"的统一基准——这是此前从未集中呈现过的资源。"欧洲目前尚无类似框架。"英国审慎监管局前银行与建房互助协会监管主任马丁·斯图尔特表示。风险联盟制定《提高标准》的目标是通过以下方式弥补风险治理与监督领域的重大空白（初期聚焦英国金融服务行业）：建立对董事会风险委员会及风险职能部门宗旨、职责与活动的共识；提供客观评估董事会风险委员会及风险职能的基准；提升英国金融服务行业风险治理与监督实践的整体水平；在承认现有详细监管规则的同时，填补基于原则的良好风险实践指导空白。该文件强调组织宗旨、战略、目标与风险的一致性，这将推动董事会风险委员会重新定位为直接影响企业整体绩效的核心委员会。此外，风险联盟预期《提高标准》将通过阐明其宗旨与价值创造能力，促进董事会风险委员会在金融服务领域之外的更广泛应用。有效的风险治理对可持续性与生存能力至关重要。"我们欢迎风险联盟提升英国金融服务风险监督标准的倡议。其方法与指导文件与我们视为重要监管目标的个人问责机制相辅相成。"英国金融行为监管局表示。"我们支持这一倡议，尤其赞赏文件对提升董事会及其委员会风险问责标准的重视。"英国财务汇报委员会评价道。
