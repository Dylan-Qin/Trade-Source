The conventional approach to trade liberalization has been to liberalize trade through international agreement and address subsequent domestic fallout and spillovers through domestic policies. In consequence, international obligations in trade liberalization are not legally connected with ‘flanking’ measures to address their negative effects. We discuss the shortcomings of this conventional approach with respect to labor adjustment and environmental protection: for political reasons, trade liberalization requires today the simultaneous regulation of labor and environmental spillovers. We suggest a novel approach to trade liberalization that includes the necessary flanking policies as part of, or linked to, the international agreement itself. This novel approach seeks to achieve the best of both worlds: reaping the benefits of international trade while making sure that negative spillovers are effectively addressed. To illustrate the intricacies of this approach, we introduce a new conceptual framework covering the negative effects of trade liberalization and flanking or mitigating policies, and a proposed novel approach in the form of trade liberalization packages and package treaties. Trade liberalization packages and package treaties are currently emerging around the world (see e.g. sustainable palm oil in EFTA–Indonesia) and deserve our close attention.

传统的贸易自由化方法是通过国际协定实现贸易自由化，并通过国内政策应对随后的国内影响和溢出效应。因此，贸易自由化的国际义务在法律上与解决其负面影响的"配套"措施并无关联。我们讨论了这一传统方法在劳动力调整和环境保护方面的不足：出于政治原因，当今的贸易自由化需要同时对劳动力和环境溢出效应进行监管。我们提出了一种新的贸易自由化方法，将必要的配套政策作为国际协定本身的一部分或与之相关联。这一新方法旨在实现两全其美：既获得国际贸易的收益，又确保有效解决负面溢出效应。为了说明这一方法的复杂性，我们引入了一个新的概念框架，涵盖贸易自由化的负面影响及配套或缓解政策，并以贸易自由化一揽子方案和条约的形式提出了这一新方法。目前，贸易自由化一揽子方案和条约正在全球范围内兴起（例如EFTA与印度尼西亚的可持续棕榈油协议），值得我们密切关注。
