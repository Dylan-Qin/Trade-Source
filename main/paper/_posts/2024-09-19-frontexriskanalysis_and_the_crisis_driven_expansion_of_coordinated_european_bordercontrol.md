Migration scholars have captured the (growing) relevance of Frontex risk analysis in the governance of borders and migration in Europe in two distinct ways. On the one hand, research interprets risk analysis as a Foucauldian governance tool which constructs migration as a risk and legitimizes securitizing interventions at the border. On the other hand, risk analysis is perceived as an internally-oriented rationalization tool which (a) limits supranational responsibility for emergency responses – shifting any blame for failure to deal with ‘normal’ and residual border risks to member states – but which equally (b) institutionalizes a leading role for EU-level and coordinated interventions when facing the high-risk scenarios depicted in Frontex risk analyses. The chapter proposes that the role of Frontexrisk analysis cannot be reduced to a tool for securitizing migration. It also serves as a powerful epistemological underbelly for managing subsidiarity problems in multi-level governance, with Frontex having been able to substantively expand EU-level coordination and responsibilities for border control despite the weak formal integration of the policy domain. In other words: while Frontex constitutes migrants as governable risks through its risk-analytical work, the agency also uses risk analysis to constitute its own (ever more influential) institutional future in European border control.

移民学者们以两种不同的方式捕捉到了Frontex风险分析在欧洲边境与移民治理中日益增长的重要性。一方面，研究将风险分析解读为一种福柯式的治理工具——它将移民建构为风险，并为边境安全化干预提供正当性。另一方面，风险分析被视为一种内向型理性化工具：它既（a）限定了超国家层面对紧急状况的响应责任（将应对"常规"及剩余边境风险失败的责任转嫁给成员国），又（b）在面对Frontex风险分析所描绘的高风险情景时，制度化欧盟层面协调干预的主导角色。本章指出，Frontex风险分析的作用不能简单归结为移民安全化工具。它更是处理多层级治理中辅助性原则难题的强大认识论工具——尽管该政策领域的形式整合程度较弱，Frontex仍借此实质性扩展了欧盟层面的边境管控协调与责任。换言之：Frontex通过风险分析工作将移民建构为可治理风险的同时，也运用风险分析在欧洲边境管控领域建构自身（日益强大的）制度未来。
