Definitions and perceptions of the role and styles of risk management, and performance management/strategic control systems have evolved over time, but it can be argued that risk management is primarily concerned with ensuring the achievement of strategic objectives. This paper shows the extent of overlap between a broad-based view of risk management, namely Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), and the balanced scorecard, which is a widely used strategic control system. A case study of one of the UK's largest retailers, Tesco plc, is used to show how ERM can be introduced as part of an existing strategic control system. The case demonstrates that, despite some differences in lines of communications, the strategic controls and risk controls can be used to achieve a common objective. Adoption of such an integrated approach, however, has implications for the profile of risk and the overall risk culture within an organisation.

关于风险管理角色与风格以及绩效管理/战略控制系统的定义和认知虽历经演变，但可以说风险管理的核心在于确保战略目标的实现。本文通过英国最大零售商乐购公司的案例研究，展现了广义风险管理（即企业风险管理ERM）与广泛应用的战略控制系统平衡计分卡之间的交叉程度，揭示如何将ERM纳入现有战略控制系统。案例表明，尽管沟通路径存在差异，战略控制与风险控制仍可协同实现共同目标。但采用这种整合方法将对组织内部的风险定位及整体风险文化产生影响。
