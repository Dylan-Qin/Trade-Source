In this paper, we consider a generic interest rate market in the presence of roll-over risk, which generates spreads in spot/forward term rates. We do not require classical absence of arbitrage and rely instead on a minimal market viability assumption, which enables us to work in the context of the benchmark approach. In a Markovian setting, we extend the control theoretic approach of \cite{GR13} and derive representations of spot/forward spreads as value functions of suitable stochastic optimal control problems, formulated under the real-world probability and with power-type objective functionals. We determine endogenously the funding-liquidity spread by relating it to the risk-sensitive optimization problem of a representative investor.

本文研究了一个存在展期风险的通用利率市场，该风险导致即期/远期期限利率产生利差。我们摒弃了传统无套利假设，转而采用最低限度的市场可行性假设，这使得我们能够在基准方法的框架下开展工作。在马尔可夫环境下，我们扩展了\cite{GR13}的控制理论方法，将即期/远期利差表示为适当随机最优控制问题的值函数——这些问题在真实概率测度下构建，并采用幂型目标泛函。通过将融资流动性利差与代表性投资者的风险敏感优化问题相关联，我们实现了对该利差的内生性确定。
