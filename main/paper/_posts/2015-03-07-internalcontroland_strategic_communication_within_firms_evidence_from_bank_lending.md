The allocation of authority affects the communication of information about clients within banks. We document that in small business lending internal control leads loan officers to propose inflated credit ratings for their clients. Inflated ratings are, however, anticipated and partly reversed by the credit officers responsible for approving credit assessments. More experienced loan officers inflate those parameters of a credit rating which are least likely to be corrected by credit officers. Our analysis covers 10,568 internal ratings for 3,661 small business clients at six retail banks. We provide empirical support to theories suggesting that internal control can induce strategic communication within organizations when senders and receivers of information have diverging interests. Our findings also point to the limits of the four-eyes principle as a risk-management tool in financial institutions.

权限分配影响银行内部关于客户信息的沟通。我们记录到，在小企业贷款中，内部控制导致信贷员为客户提出虚高的信用评级。然而，这些虚高的评级会被负责审批信贷评估的信贷官预见并部分修正。经验更丰富的信贷员会虚增那些最不可能被信贷官修正的信用评级参数。我们的分析涵盖了六家零售银行3,661个小企业客户的10,568个内部评级。我们为相关理论提供了实证支持，这些理论认为当信息发送者和接收者利益不一致时，内部控制可能引发组织内的策略性沟通。研究结果还指出"四眼原则"作为金融机构风险管理工具的局限性。
