The Basel Committee plans to revise the Standardised Approach (SA) to bank capital for credit risk and to employ the revised SA as a floor for bank capital based on internal models. The changes are likely to have a major impact on the overall level of capital and its distribution across banks and asset classes. This paper examines the effects of the proposed changes in capital rules on the Swiss loan market. Using primarily public information, we estimate the effects on the capital of individual Swiss banks broken down by asset class. We infer what this is likely to imply for lending rates in the Swiss market. We find that the proposed rule changes would substantially boost capital overall, affecting most severely capital for Corporate and Specialised Lending exposures. Under the BCBS 347 proposals, total bank capital would rise 39% while capital for Corporate and Specialised Lending exposures would increase by 142% and 130%, respectively. This allocation of capital across asset classes is inconsistent with the lessons of the recent financial crisis which was triggered by the collapse of the US residential mortgage market and involved relatively little impact on the quality of corporate credit. By our calculations, bank spreads for corporate loans would rise by between 63 and 103 basis points.

巴塞尔委员会计划修订银行信用风险资本的标准法（SA），并将修订后的SA作为基于内部模型的银行资本底线。这些变动可能对资本总体水平及其在银行和资产类别间的分布产生重大影响。本文研究了拟议资本规则变动对瑞士贷款市场的影响。我们主要利用公开信息，估算了其对瑞士各银行按资产类别划分的资本影响，并推断这将对瑞士市场的贷款利率产生何种影响。研究发现，拟议规则变动将大幅提升整体资本水平，其中企业和专业贷款敞口的资本受影响最为严重。根据BCBS 347提案，银行总资本将增加39%，而企业和专业贷款敞口的资本将分别上升142%和130%。这种跨资产类别的资本分配与近期金融危机的教训相矛盾——该危机由美国住宅抵押贷款市场崩溃引发，对企业信贷质量影响相对较小。据我们测算，企业贷款的银行利差将上升63至103个基点。
