This paper identifies some of the key intersections between trade policy and water management, in areas such as agriculture, hydropower generation, water services and wastewater management. From a trade policy perspective, the main immediate concern is to ensure that international trade rules and disciplines do not unduly affect countries’ ability to manage their water resources sustainably and according to their respective social preferences. While the local nature of water systems and the diversity of water management objectives is not conducive to the application of trade instruments to enforce a prescriptive, one-size-fits-all approach to water management, there is also a range of areas in which trade policy could support the sustainable management of water and related SDG objectives.

本文探讨了贸易政策与水资源管理在农业、水力发电、供水服务及废水处理等领域的若干关键交叉点。从贸易政策视角出发，当前首要关注点是确保国际贸易规则和纪律不会过度制约各国根据自身社会偏好可持续管理水资源的能力。尽管水系统的地域特性及水资源管理目标的多样性不适宜采用贸易工具来推行一刀切式的指令性管理方法，但贸易政策仍可在诸多领域支持水资源可持续管理及相关可持续发展目标的实现。
