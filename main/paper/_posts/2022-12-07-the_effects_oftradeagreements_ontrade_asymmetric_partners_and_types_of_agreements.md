In this paper, we investigate the effects of preferential trade agreements on trade volumes for over 170 countries from 1970 to 2010 using the microfounded gravity model.To disentangle the relative impact of partners’ income groups (North-North, North-South, and South-South) and levels of economic integration, this study uses uni-directional trade flows between two countries and disaggregate types of agreement (Customs Unions, Free Trade Agreements, and Partial Scope Agreements). Preferential trade liberalization was found to have strong positive effects on trade between two trade partners on average.The South-South RTAs have the strongest trade-creating effect in comparison to other combinations of trade agreements. Surprisingly, the North’s trade-creating effects were found to be much stronger in North-South trade agreements.These results imply that developed countries experience more beneficial effects on exports than developing or less developed countries through preferential trade agreements. Moreover, Custom Unions were found to have stronger trade-creating effects than FTAs or PSAs.

本文运用微观基础引力模型，研究了1970至2010年间 preferential trade agreements 对170余个国家贸易流量的影响。为区分贸易伙伴收入群体（北北型、南北型、南南型）与经济一体化水平的相对作用，本研究采用两国间单向贸易流数据，并对协定类型（关税同盟、自由贸易协定、局部范围协定）进行细分分析。研究发现，preferential trade liberalization 平均而言对贸易伙伴间交易量具有显著促进作用。与其他类型协定相比，南南型区域贸易协定产生的贸易创造效应最为突出。出人意料的是，北方国家在南北型协定中表现出更强的贸易创造效应，这表明发达国家通过preferential trade agreements获得的出口收益高于发展中国家或欠发达国家。此外，关税同盟的贸易创造效应强于自由贸易协定或局部范围协定。
