In standard ratings-based models for analyzing credit portfolios and pricing credit derivatives, it is assumed that defaults and recoveries are statistically independent. This paper presents evidence that aggregate quarterly default rates and recovery rates are, in fact, negatively correlated. Using Extreme Value Theory techniques, we show that the dependence affects the tail behavior of total credit loss distributions and leads to higher VaR measures.

在分析信用组合和定价信用衍生产品的标准评级模型中，通常假设违约与回收率在统计上相互独立。本文提供的证据表明，季度总违约率与回收率实际上呈负相关关系。通过运用极值理论技术，我们发现这种依赖性会影响信用损失总体分布的尾部行为，并导致更高的风险价值（VaR）测度。
