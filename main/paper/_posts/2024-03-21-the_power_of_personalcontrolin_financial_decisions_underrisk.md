This study provides evidence from a randomized controlled incentivized experiment, and the field, that people make riskier financial decisions after experiencing helplessness. Analysis of field data suggests greater gambling expenditure after a loss of personal control as captured in large-scale longitudinal surveys. I propose a new model that builds on prospect theory to incorporate biological mechanisms that explain the power of personal control in decisions under risk. The model does not require a probability weighting function and has the advantage of being cardinal, continuous and bounded, making it highly adaptable and generally applicable. I test the model using an incentivized experiment involving 273 subjects. Inducing helplessness with a validated induction causes significantly higher risky investment compared to the control group. Results are robust controlling for baseline risk preferences, wealth effects, bounded rationality and gender. Both experimental and field data verifies that a loss of personal control is a powerful determinant of financial decisions under risk.

这项研究通过随机对照激励实验和实地数据证明，人们在经历无助感后会做出风险更高的财务决策。对实地数据的分析表明，大规模纵向调查显示，在丧失个人控制力后，人们的赌博支出会增加。我提出了一个基于前景理论的新模型，该模型结合了生物学机制，用以解释个人控制在风险决策中的影响力。该模型无需概率加权函数，并具有基数性、连续性和有界性的优势，使其具备高度适应性和普适性。我通过一项涉及273名受试者的激励实验对该模型进行了验证。采用已验证的诱导方法引发无助感后，实验组相比对照组表现出显著更高的风险投资倾向。研究结果在控制基线风险偏好、财富效应、有限理性和性别因素后依然稳健。实验与实地数据均证实，个人控制力的丧失是风险情境下财务决策的重要决定因素。
