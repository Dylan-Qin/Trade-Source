In modern society, products are often subject to requirements relating to their characteristics and/or the manner in which they are produced. The purpose of these requirements may be the protection of life or health, the protection of the environment, the prevention of deceptive practices or to ensure the quality of products. These requirements may constitute formidable barriers to trade. Moreover, procedures set up to verify whether a product meets certain requirements may obstruct trade. These barriers to trade are referred to as technical barriers to trade. One must distinguish between:   the general category of technical barriers to trade, for which rules have been set out in the TBT Agreement; and    a special category of technical barriers to trade, namely sanitary and phytosanitary measures, for which rules are provided in the SPS Agreement. The rules of the TBT Agreement and the SPS Agreement are of great importance to international trade. They go significantly beyond the GATT obligations not to discriminate among or against imported products or not to impose quantitative restrictions but also impose certain international disciplines on national regulation regarding products, their characteristics and production. This working paper gives an overview of the scope of application as well as the substantive and institutional/procedural provisions of the TBT Agreement and the SPS Agreement.

在现代社会中，产品常需符合与其特性及/或生产方式相关的要求。这些要求的目的可能是保护生命健康、保护环境、防止欺诈行为或确保产品质量。此类要求可能构成巨大的贸易壁垒。此外，为验证产品是否符合特定要求而设立的程序也可能阻碍贸易。这类贸易壁垒被称为技术性贸易壁垒。必须区分以下两类：. • 一般性技术贸易壁垒，其规则由《技术性贸易壁垒协定》（TBT协定）规定；. • 特殊技术贸易壁垒，即卫生与植物检疫措施，其规则由《实施卫生与植物检疫措施协定》（SPS协定）规定。. . TBT协定与SPS协定的规则对国际贸易至关重要。它们不仅大幅超越了《关税及贸易总协定》（GATT）关于不歧视进口产品或不实施数量限制的义务，还对各国关于产品特性及生产的法规设定了国际纪律约束。本工作文件概述了TBT协定与SPS协定的适用范围、实质性条款及制度性/程序性规定。
