Concern over an organization’s reputation is at a heightened level and has become a top strategic business risk. Reputation creation, enhancement, and protection are critical to an organization’s success, yet highly challenging given the wide ranging and somewhat opaque nature of the concept as well as the variety of potential events causing harm. These qualities call for a strong enterprise risk management (ERM) approach to reputation that is holistic and integrative, yet existing knowledge of how to do so is limited. The aim of this paper is to evaluate and synthesize existing reputation literature in developing an enterprise-wide reputation risk management framework incorporating necessary steps, processes, and considerations. We address risk strategy, risk assessment, risk governance, and risk culture as key elements of ERM and conclude with suggestions for future research.

对企业声誉的关注已达到前所未有的高度，并成为首要战略商业风险。声誉的建立、提升和保护对组织成功至关重要，但由于这一概念的广泛性和一定模糊性，以及可能造成损害的各类潜在事件，实现这些目标极具挑战性。这些特性要求采用全面且综合的强健企业风险管理（ERM）方法来应对声誉风险，然而现有相关实践知识仍显不足。本文旨在通过评估整合现有声誉文献，构建一个涵盖必要步骤、流程和考量的全企业声誉风险管理框架。我们将风险战略、风险评估、风险治理和风险文化作为企业风险管理的核心要素进行探讨，并最终提出未来研究方向建议。
