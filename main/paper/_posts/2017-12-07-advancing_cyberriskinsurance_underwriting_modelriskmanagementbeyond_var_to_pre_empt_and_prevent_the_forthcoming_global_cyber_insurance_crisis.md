Mainstream insurance industry practices have adopted Value-at-Risk (VaR) from global financial industry as the pre-dominant cyber insurance model being oblivious to both distinguishing characteristics of cyber-risks as well as statistical properties of VaR. Such widespread misapplication of VaR for cyber risk insurance underwriting unless abated and corrected is expected to lead to a global cyber-insurance crisis that may dwarf the worldwide economic shock from the global financial crisis. Given worldwide high impact of increasingly global cyber-attacks, the current paper advances cyber risk insurance underwriting model risk management beyond VaR to pre-empt and prevent the forthcoming global cyber-insurance crisis.

主流保险业实践已采用全球金融业的风险价值(VaR)作为主导性网络保险模型，却忽视了网络风险的独特性以及VaR的统计特性。这种对VaR在网络风险保险承保中的普遍误用若不加以遏制和纠正，预计将引发全球网络保险危机，其严重程度可能使全球金融危机造成的经济冲击相形见绌。鉴于日益全球化的网络攻击在世界范围内产生的高影响，本文提出将网络风险保险承保的模型风险管理推进至超越VaR的层面，以预先防范并阻止即将到来的全球网络保险危机。
