This paper investigates the impact of internal control effectiveness (ICE) on the level of textual risk disclosure (TRD; including aggregate risk disclosure and its tone of good news and bad news about risk). Our findings suggest that firms with an ineffective internal control system exhibit significantly lower levels of TRD than firms with effective internal controls. Besides, we show a significant change in TRD behavior provided by managers of firms with recurrent ineffective internal controls. Pursuant to agency theory, this behavior change is prompted to reduce the expected public uncertainty and agency problems. We also investigate the usefulness of ICE reporting and TRD to the market. Results suggest that firms reporting ineffective internal controls are likely to have higher investor-perceived risk than firms reporting effective internal controls. Furthermore, TRD improves firms’ market liquidity, and such improvement is principally driven by good news rather than bad news about risk. Collectively, our results fill an apparent gap in the literature on the importance of ICE, as well as the usefulness of the external auditor’s attestation on a firm’s internal controls and management TRD.

本文研究了内部控制有效性（ICE）对文本风险披露水平（TRD，包括总体风险披露及其关于风险的好消息和坏消息语气）的影响。研究发现，与内部控制有效的企业相比，内部控制无效企业的TRD水平显著较低。此外，我们发现内部控制反复无效的企业管理层会显著改变其TRD行为。根据代理理论，这种行为改变旨在降低预期的公众不确定性和代理问题。我们还探讨了ICE报告和TRD对市场的实用性。结果表明，与报告内部控制有效的企业相比，报告内部控制无效的企业可能面临更高的投资者感知风险。此外，TRD能提升企业的市场流动性，且这种改善主要源于关于风险的好消息而非坏消息。总体而言，我们的研究填补了现有文献关于ICE重要性、外部审计师对企业内部控制的鉴证作用以及管理层TRD实用性的明显空白。
