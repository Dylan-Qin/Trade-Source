Capital account liberalization is generally beneficial to developing and emerging countries. However, if there is a downside risk in one country, capital control policy can prevent it from exposing to carry trade flows and capital flight, and protect it from external financial volatility. In this paper, we study the marginal effects of different types of China's capital control indices on GDP growth distribution and the term structure of such distribution using quantile regressions with local projections and fitted skewed t-distribution. We find that: (i) there are heterogeneous effects of China's capital control policies on GDP growth distribution: the aggregated capital control indices are beneficial in reducing the downside risk of real GDP growth in medium term whereas they are costly on the upswings of real GDP growth in near-term; (ii) the marginal effects of capital control indices on GDP growth over quantiles show that the heterogeneous effects are stronger in near-term than medium term; (iii) specifically, these heterogeneous effects are more evident in short term for outflow control index and resident transaction control index; (iv) the granular capital control indices show broadly heterogeneous effects even if several of them are statistically insignificant.

资本账户开放通常对发展中国家和新兴国家有利。然而，若一国存在下行风险，资本管制政策可防止其暴露于利差交易流动和资本外逃，并保护其免受外部金融波动影响。本文通过结合局部投影的分位数回归与拟合偏态t分布，研究了中国各类资本管制指标对GDP增长分布及其期限结构的边际效应。研究发现：（一）中国资本管制政策对GDP增长分布存在异质性影响：综合资本管制指标有助于降低中期实际GDP增长的下行风险，但会在短期内抑制实际GDP增长的上升空间；（二）资本管制指标对GDP增长分位数的边际效应表明，这种异质性影响在短期内比中期更为显著；（三）具体而言，流出管制指标和居民交易管制指标的异质性效应在短期更为明显；（四）细分资本管制指标普遍呈现异质性影响，尽管部分指标在统计上不显著。
