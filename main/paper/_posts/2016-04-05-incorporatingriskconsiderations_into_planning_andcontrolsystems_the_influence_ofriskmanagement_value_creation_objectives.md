Using data on a broad international sample of listed, private, and non-profit entities, we explore the influence of risk management value creation objectives on the incorporation of risk considerations in planning and control systems. The combination of detailed survey responses and archival data allow us to provide evidence on the adoption of a wide variety of risk-focused planning and control practices, to examine how these practices vary with risk management objectives, and to shed light on the performance implications of risk-focused planning and control practices and risk management objectives. Our results highlight the important influence that risk management value creation objectives can have on the use and benefits from risk-focused planning and control practices. Organizations that primarily focus on minimizing risks within budget or reducing the total cost of risks tend to make less use of these practices, have higher stock price volatility, and achieve lower firm value than those that have taken greater steps to holistically consider both the upsides and downsides of risk.

基于对上市企业、私营机构及非营利组织的广泛国际样本数据，我们探究了风险管理价值创造目标对规划与控制系统纳入风险考量程度的影响。通过结合详尽的问卷调查回复与档案数据，我们得以呈现各类风险导向型规划控制实践的应用现状，分析这些实践如何随风险管理目标而变化，并揭示风险导向型规划控制实践与风险管理目标对组织绩效的影响。研究结果凸显了风险管理价值创造目标对风险导向型规划控制实践应用及其效益的重要影响：相较于那些更全面权衡风险正反两面的组织，主要关注预算内风险最小化或降低风险总成本的企业往往较少采用此类实践，其股价波动性更高，最终实现的企业价值也较低。
