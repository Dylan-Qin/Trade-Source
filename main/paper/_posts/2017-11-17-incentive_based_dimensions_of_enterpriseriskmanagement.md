There has been a large and committed shift to converting corporate risk management programs into enterprise risk management (ERM) systems, but the ERM literature still lacks a clear and structured picture of the incentives/benefits of ERM. We provide a structured and substantiated way of conceptualizing ERM that captures and organizes the already existing discourse. We propose that there are essentially three dimensions of ERM: governance, integration, and strategy. In a further refinement, we propose a categorization of six underlying incentives for ERM: to, (i) achieve risk oversight, (ii) provide structure to the risk management system, (iii) increase organizational risk awareness, (iv) manage portfolios of risk, (v) develop strategy, and (vi) improve strategic decision-making.

企业风险管理项目正大规模且坚定地转向企业全面风险管理（ERM）系统，但现有文献仍缺乏对ERM激励因素/益处的清晰结构化描述。我们提出了一种结构化且可验证的ERM概念化方法，对现有论述进行了系统梳理。我们认为ERM本质上包含三个维度：治理、整合与战略。进一步细分后，我们提出六项基础激励因素分类：（一）实现风险监督；（二）构建风险管理体系框架；（三）提升组织风险意识；（四）管理风险组合；（五）制定战略；（六）优化战略决策。
