Based on the most recent annual reports of HC we check its risk management. Since cement is manufactured through an energy-intensive process, the focus is on energy price risk. HC has been taken by surprise by soaring energy prices in Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 2018. This has led to (repeated) downgrades of their outlook but no upward move on the learning curve. Instead, HC bets on falling energy prices for the future despite being no expert in these markets. Thus, shareholders are getting a big short position in energy on top of being long cement. Only the latter confirms to the business purpose of HC. HC is not clear on this and equity analysts seem to have little interest neither. No sensitivities to energy prices are reported. Hence, for HC there are more steps to go towards state-of-the-art CRM.

根据HC最新的年度报告，我们对其风险管理进行了核查。由于水泥生产属于高能耗过程，能源价格风险成为关注重点。HC在2018年第一、二、三、四季度连续遭遇能源价格飙升的意外冲击，这导致其业绩展望（多次）被下调，但并未推动其风险管理能力的提升。相反，尽管并非能源市场专家，HC仍押注未来能源价格将下跌。这使得股东在持有水泥多头的同时，实质上还持有了能源的空头头寸——唯有前者符合HC的企业宗旨。HC对此缺乏清醒认知，股权分析师似乎也兴趣寥寥。报告中未披露任何针对能源价格的敏感性分析。由此可见，HC要达成一流的全面风险管理仍有很长的路要走。
