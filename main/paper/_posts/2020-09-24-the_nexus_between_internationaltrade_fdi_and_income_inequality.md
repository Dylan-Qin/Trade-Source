Purpose – This paper investigated the effect of international trade affects income inequality. It alsocompares the different effects between developing and developed countries over the period from 2005 to 2014 for 58 countries.Design/methodology – The econometric estimation was used to identify the relationship betweenexport, import, FDI, GDP, unemployment and income inequality. In this empirical analysis, weutilized a Vector Error Correction (VEC) model using panel data.Findings – The findings show that there is a close correlated between trade and income inequality.The higher export ratio of GDP tends to have a 1.79 times more income inequality in developingcountries than in developed countries. The higher import ratio of GDP tends to have a 2.44 timeshigher income inequality in developing countries than in developed countries. Further, IncreasingFDI tend to have an approximately 1.43 times higher income inequality in developing countries thanin developed countries. Korea is in the middle of developed and developing countries’ result.Originality/value – To correct the global income inequality regarding trade, developed countries’proactive trade policies, such as granting preferential tariff benefits to developing countries, are likely to be needed and Income Safety Net in international trade must be taken into account.

目的——本文研究了国际贸易对收入不平等的影响，并比较了2005至2014年间58个发展中国家与发达国家的不同影响效应。  . 设计/方法——通过计量经济学估算来识别出口、进口、外国直接投资（FDI）、国内生产总值（GDP）、失业率与收入不平等之间的关系。在此实证分析中，我们采用了面板数据的向量误差修正（VEC）模型。  . 研究结果——研究结果表明，贸易与收入不平等之间存在密切关联。GDP中出口比例较高的国家，发展中国家的收入不平等程度是发达国家的1.79倍；GDP中进口比例较高的国家，发展中国家的收入不平等程度是发达国家的2.44倍。此外，外国直接投资的增加在发展中国家导致的收入不平等程度约为发达国家的1.43倍。韩国的结果介于发达国家与发展中国家之间。  . 原创性/价值——为纠正全球贸易中的收入不平等问题，可能需要发达国家采取积极的贸易政策，例如向发展中国家提供优惠关税待遇，同时还需考虑国际贸易中的收入安全网机制。
