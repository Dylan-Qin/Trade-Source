Recently, such probabilistic, statistical, and numerical methods related concerns are in globally popular press related to cybersecurity controls and compliance. Earlier, similar probabilistic, statistical, and numerical methods related concerns were in the global popular press in the context of the global financial crisis. Future questions focused on the underlying assumptions and logic may focus on related implications for compliance, controls, valuation, risk management, etc. Likewise, recent developments about mathematical entropy measures shedding new light on apparently greater vulnerability of prior encryption mechanisms may offer additional insights for compliance and control experts. For instance, given related mathematical, statistical and numerical frameworks, analysis may also focus on potential implications for pricing, valuation and risk models. The important point is that many such fundamental assumptions and logic underlying widely used probabilistic, statistical, and numerical methods may not as readily meet the eye.

近来，与网络安全控制和合规相关的概率、统计及数值方法问题成为全球热门媒体的焦点。早前，类似的概率、统计及数值方法问题曾在全球金融危机期间引发广泛讨论。未来针对基本假设与逻辑的探讨可能集中于合规、控制、估值及风险管理等领域的影响。同样，近期关于数学熵测度的研究揭示了早期加密机制存在更高脆弱性的现象，或将为合规与控制专家提供新的视角。例如，基于相关数学、统计及数值框架的分析，可能进一步探讨其对定价、估值与风险模型的潜在影响。关键在于，这些广泛使用的概率、统计及数值方法背后的基础假设与逻辑，往往不易被直接察觉。
