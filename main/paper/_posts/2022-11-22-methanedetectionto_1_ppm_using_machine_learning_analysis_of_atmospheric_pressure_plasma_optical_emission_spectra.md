Optical emission spectroscopy from a small-volume, 5 μl, atmospheric pressure RF-driven helium plasma was used in conjunction with partial least squares-discriminant analysis for the detection of trace concentrations of methane gas. A limit of detection of 1 ppm was obtained and sample concentrations up to 100 ppm CH4 were classified using a nine-category model. A range of algorithm enhancements were investigated including regularization, simple data segmentation and subset selection, feature selection via Variable Importance in Projection and wavelength variable compression in order to address the high dimensionality and collinearity of spectral emission data. These approaches showed the potential for significant reduction in the number of wavelength variables and the spectral resolution/bandwidth. Wavelength variable compression exhibited reliable predictive performance, with accuracy values >97%, under more challenging multi-session train—test scenarios. Simple modelling of plasma electron energy distribution functions highlights the complex cross-sensitivities between the target methane, its dissociation products and atmospheric impurities and their impact on excitation and emission.

利用小体积（5微升）大气压射频驱动氦等离子体的光学发射光谱，结合偏最小二乘判别分析，实现了痕量甲烷气体的检测。该方法检测限达1 ppm，并采用九分类模型对浓度高达100 ppm的甲烷样本进行了分类。针对光谱发射数据的高维度和共线性问题，研究探索了多种算法优化策略，包括正则化处理、简单数据分段与子集选择、基于投影变量重要性的特征筛选以及波长变量压缩。这些方法显著减少了波长变量数量，并降低了所需光谱分辨率/带宽。在更具挑战性的多批次训练-测试场景中，波长变量压缩展现出可靠的预测性能，准确率超过97%。通过对等离子体电子能量分布函数的简易建模，揭示了目标甲烷、其解离产物与大气杂质之间复杂的交叉敏感性，及其对激发与发射过程的影响。
