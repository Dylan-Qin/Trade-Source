Despite attempts to reduce it, financial fraud continues to be a major problem in many industries, including healthcare, banking, and insurance. Traditional fraud detection techniques, which are often manual, are inefficient, time-consuming, and costly. As a result, methods that use AI and ML have been implemented to improve fraud detection procedures. This study examines the application of ML algorithms for credit card fraud detection using a dataset consisting of 284,807 transactions made by European cardholders in 2013, out of which 492 were fraudulent. Preprocessing steps, including Label Encoding, SMOTE for handling class imbalance, and PCA for feature reduction, were applied to the dataset. On the training dataset have applied ML based classification models like DT, SVM, and ANNs were employed to evaluate their performance. The models were assessed using accuracy, precision, and recall as key metrics. The ANN model emerged as the best-performing model, achieving 98.41%precision, 98.69%accuracy, and 98.98%recall, outperforming both Decision Trees and SVM. This study highlights the effectiveness of ML models, particularly ANNs, in improving financial fraud detection.

尽管已尝试减少金融欺诈，但它仍是医疗、银行和保险等众多行业的主要问题。传统欺诈检测技术通常依赖人工操作，效率低下、耗时且成本高昂。因此，采用人工智能和机器学习的方法已被应用于改进欺诈检测流程。本研究利用2013年欧洲持卡人284,807笔交易（其中492笔为欺诈交易）的数据集，探讨了机器学习算法在信用卡欺诈检测中的应用。研究对数据集进行了标签编码、SMOTE（处理类别不平衡）和PCA（特征降维）等预处理步骤，并采用基于机器学习的分类模型（如决策树、支持向量机和人工神经网络）评估性能。模型通过准确率、精确率和召回率等关键指标进行评估。结果显示，人工神经网络模型表现最佳，精确率达98.41%、准确率98.69%、召回率98.98%，优于决策树和支持向量机。本研究证实了机器学习模型（尤其是人工神经网络）在提升金融欺诈检测效能方面的突出作用。
