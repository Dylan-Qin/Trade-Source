At a time when the high-tech industry has increasingly demanded harmonized standards, China has signaled its intention to follow a different direction.  China's recent actions seeking to set its own unique standards instead of adopting international standards shifts focus to the impact on international trade and the corresponding legal framework defining responsibilities for State members of the World Trade Organization.  While trade barriers of the past - high tariffs and quotas imposed on imports - have been greatly reduced, less obvious impediments normally referred to as non-tariff barriers (NTBs) have in many cases replaced them.  One area ripe for the incursion of NTBs concerns technology standards.  The WTO's Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade recognizes the important contribution that international standards can make by improving efficiency of production and facilitating the conduct of international trade, but also cautions that standards should not be used to create NTBs.  China's WAPI standard provides a test-case for ICT standards and their relationship to the international trade regime. It serves to illustrate standards' dual nature as trade facilitators and indispensable elements of the ICT industry, on the one hand, and as potential measures of protectionism when applied inappropriately, on the other hand.  As China's economic power grows and it becomes more adept at playing the standards game, it may find new means for pressing its own concerns in relation to international standards and trade-related issues.

在高科技产业日益要求统一标准之际，中国却表现出要走不同方向的意图。中国近期寻求制定自身独特标准而非采用国际标准的举动，将关注焦点转向了对国际贸易的影响，以及界定世界贸易组织成员国责任的相应法律框架。虽然过去的贸易壁垒——对进口商品征收高额关税和配额——已大幅减少，但在许多情况下，它们已被不太明显的障碍所取代，这些障碍通常被称为非关税壁垒（NTBs）。技术标准领域正是非关税壁垒容易侵入的一个领域。世贸组织的《技术性贸易壁垒协定》承认国际标准通过提高生产效率和促进国际贸易开展所能做出的重要贡献，但也警告不应将标准用于制造非关税壁垒。中国的WAPI标准为信息通信技术标准及其与国际贸易体系的关系提供了一个测试案例。它一方面说明了标准作为贸易促进者和信息通信技术产业不可或缺要素的双重性质，另一方面也说明了标准若应用不当可能成为保护主义手段。随着中国经济实力的增长以及更擅长参与标准制定游戏，它可能会找到新的手段来推动自身在国际标准和贸易相关问题上的诉求。
