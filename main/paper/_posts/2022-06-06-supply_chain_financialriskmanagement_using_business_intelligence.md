Supply chain risk management is the way of defining, assessing, and reducing risk in your entire supply chain. It involves management of all kinds of hazards, across all supply tiers, and across all hazard objects (suppliers, locations, ports and more). Because the supply chain industry is rapidly expanding, there is a need to identify potential weaknesses and internal inefficiencies in the organization and develop solutions to overcome them. Also, there is a need to monitor the company’s performance, to have a check on the progress of the company’s growth and check for any disruptions in the flow of the supply chain. Detecting and controlling risks has become an essential component of global supply networks. Machine learning techniques are used to discover risks in the system as well as to assist in identifying the source of the risk. After doing it, the company may attempt to optimize the source of the risk and, as a result, decrease the losses sustained as a result of it. Thus, to manage financial risks in the supply chain, a framework of risk detection models using machine learning is proposed. The main objective is to detect risks and identify its causes. The proposed model focus on three different hazard areas of a supply chain namely Transportation, Sales and Delivery and for each area, a risk detection model is trained and tested and compared with existing approaches and then tuned based on the results. Despite the specificity of the supply chain data used, the proposed system can be adapted to any other type of supply chain.

供应链风险管理是对整个供应链中的风险进行定义、评估和降低的方法。它涉及对所有供应层级、所有危害对象（供应商、地点、港口等）中各类风险的管理。由于供应链行业正在迅速扩张，有必要识别组织内部的潜在弱点和低效问题，并制定解决方案加以克服。此外，还需要监控公司绩效，检查公司增长进度，并排查供应链流程中的任何中断。风险检测与控制已成为全球供应网络的重要组成部分。机器学习技术被用于发现系统中的风险，并协助识别风险来源。之后，公司可以尝试优化风险源头，从而减少由此造成的损失。因此，为管理供应链中的财务风险，本文提出了一种基于机器学习的风险检测模型框架，其主要目标是检测风险并识别其原因。所提出的模型聚焦于供应链中三个不同的风险领域：运输、销售和交付，针对每个领域分别训练和测试风险检测模型，与现有方法进行比较后根据结果进行调整。尽管所使用的供应链数据具有特定性，但该系统可适用于任何其他类型的供应链。
