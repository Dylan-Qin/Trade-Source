This paper addresses the issue of poverty alleviation and TRTACB in the international development agenda. First, it discusses the current state of poverty in the world and the criteria for classifying LDCs as candidates to development assistance. Second, it reviews the literature on the links between poverty and trade. Third, it describes the major TRTACB initiatives, highlighting their interconnectedness in the light of coordination and monitoring efforts. Fourth, it analyzes if such initiatives have a measurable effect on poverty reduction, using cross - country evidence during 1990-2006. Finally, based on results, the paper determines whether continuing efforts to channel ODA to TRTACB effectively contribute to reducing poverty in LDCs.

本文探讨了国际发展议程中的减贫与贸易相关技术援助和能力建设（TRTACB）问题。首先，分析了全球贫困现状及最不发达国家（LDCs）作为发展援助受援国的分类标准；其次，梳理了贫困与贸易关联性的现有文献；再次，阐述了主要TRTACB倡议，着重从协调与监督角度揭示其相互关联性；随后，基于1990-2006年跨国数据，实证检验了这些倡议对减贫的可量化影响；最后，根据研究结果论证了持续将官方发展援助（ODA）导向TRTACB是否有效促进最不发达国家减贫。
