The Netherlands is highly dependent on international trade for its  economic prosperity. Successive Dutch governments have, therefore, always supported the further liberalization of international trade. At the same time, the public debate on economic globalization and international trade reveals that citizens as well as policy makers fear the corrosive impact of international trade on the core societal values on which Dutch society is founded. They fear that international trade, in particular a further liberalization thereof, may undermine or put at risk policies and measures for the protection of public health, the environment, labour rights, social welfare, good governance, national security, cultural identity, food safety, access to knowledge, consumer interests and animal welfare. There is a general consensus in the Netherlands that these non-trade concerns (NTC's), which cover very different societal aspirations and fears, must be addressed in Dutch government policy and measures relating to international trade. Many of the trade measures introduced by developed countries to address non-trade concerns have been met by developing countries with much suspicion and opposition. Developing countries often suspect that such measures are inspired by protectionist motives and intentions, rather than genuine non-trade concerns. Moreover, developing countries perceive these measures as an attempt by developed countries to impose their social, ethical or cultural values and preferences on exporting developing countries. Over the last two years, the debate in the Netherlands on trade measures addressing non-trade concerns has focused on two important and politically sensitive issues, namely:   the sustainability of the large-scale production of biomass as an alternative source of energy; and   the production of livestock products in a manner that is consistent with animal welfare requirements. With regard to the first issue  sustainable biomass production  in February 2007 the Project Group Duurzame Productie van Biomassa, a commission established by the government and chaired by Jacqueline Cramer (hereinafter the 'Cramer Commission'), issued a report on the Toetsingskader voor Duurzame Biomassa (hereinafter the 'Cramer Report'). This report discusses the risks associated with large-scale biomass production and establishes a list of criteria for the sustainable production of biomass. These criteria (hereinafter the 'Cramer sustainability criteria') reflect a broad range of non-trade concerns, including environmental protection, global warming, food security, biodiversity, economic prosperity and social welfare. The Cramer Report invites the Dutch government to give effect to the Cramer sustainability criteria by incorporating them into relevant policy. The report recognizes, however, that the implementation of the Cramer sustainability criteria (including the establishment of a certification system) will require careful consideration of the obligations of the Netherlands under EU and WTO law. With regard to the second issue  animal welfare  modern methods of intensive agricultural production have generated, especially in Europe, increased concern about the treatment of farm animals, in particular with regard to their housing, nutrition, transportation and slaughter. Individual EU Member States, including the Netherlands, as well the EU itself, have adopted wide-ranging animal welfare legislation. Governments called upon to address non-trade concerns may do so by using different types of measures. Prominent among these are measures concerning processes and production methods of products. These measures may concern either:   product-related processes and production methods (PR PPMs), i.e. measures that prescribe processes and production methods that affect the characteristics of products (e.g. measures prohibiting the use of growth hormones for cattle in the production of meat, or prohibiting the use of pesticides in the production of vegetables); or   non-product-related processes and production methods (nPR PPMs), i.e. measures that prescribe processes and production methods that do not, or in a negligible manner only, affect the characteristics of the products (e.g. a measure requiring that tuna fishing vessels use dolphin-friendly nets). The second type of measure, i.e. measures concerning nPR PPMs, is  much more than measures concerning PR PPMs  the subject of controversy. Pursuant to its terms of reference, this study therefore focuses on three main issues relating to unilateral non-product-related PPM measures addressing non-trade concerns, namely:   the consistency of unilateral nPR PPM measures addressing non-trade concerns with the obligations under the WTO Agreement (see Part 1);   the relevance of other international agreements for unilateral nPR PPM measures addressing non-trade concerns (see Part 2); and    the economic effectiveness and efficiency, as well as the impact on developing countries, of unilateral nPR PPM measures addressing non-trade concerns. In the present study, these issues are examined primarily with regard to existing, proposed or still purely hypothetical measures for implementing the Cramer criteria for the sustainable production of biomass, or measures for the protection and promotion of animal welfare.

荷兰的经济繁荣高度依赖国际贸易。因此，历届荷兰政府始终支持进一步推动国际贸易自由化。与此同时，关于经济全球化与国际贸易的公共讨论显示，民众和政策制定者都担忧国际贸易会侵蚀荷兰社会赖以建立的核心价值观。他们担心国际贸易——尤其是进一步自由化——可能损害或危及旨在保护公共卫生、环境、劳工权利、社会福利、良政、国家安全、文化认同、食品安全、知识获取、消费者利益及动物福利的政策措施。荷兰社会普遍共识认为，这些涵盖多元社会诉求与忧虑的非贸易关切事项（NTC's），必须在政府涉及国际贸易的政策与措施中得到处理。. . 发达国家为应对非贸易关切出台的许多贸易措施，常引发发展中国家的强烈质疑与反对。发展中国家往往认为这些措施源于保护主义动机，而非真正的非贸易关切，并视其为发达国家试图将自身社会、伦理或文化价值观强加于出口型发展中国家。过去两年间，荷兰国内关于应对非贸易关切的贸易措施争论聚焦于两大政治敏感议题：一是作为替代能源的大规模生物质生产的可持续性；二是符合动物福利要求的畜产品生产方式。. . 针对生物质可持续生产议题，2007年2月，由政府设立、杰奎琳·克拉默（以下简称"克拉默委员会"）领导的"可持续生物质生产项目组"发布了《可持续生物质认证框架》报告（以下简称《克拉默报告》）。该报告分析了大规模生物质生产的风险，并制定了一套可持续生产标准（以下简称"克拉默可持续标准"），涵盖环境保护、全球变暖、粮食安全、生物多样性、经济繁荣及社会福利等广泛非贸易关切。报告建议政府将标准纳入相关政策，但强调实施过程（包括认证体系建立）需审慎考量荷兰在欧盟与WTO框架下的义务。. . 关于动物福利议题，现代农业集约化生产方式（尤其在欧洲）引发对农场动物待遇的深切关注，涉及饲养、运输、屠宰等环节。荷兰等欧盟成员国及欧盟层面已通过综合性动物福利立法。. . 政府处理非贸易关切时可采取不同类型措施，其中关于产品加工与生产方法（PPMs）的措施尤为突出。这类措施分为两类：一是影响产品特性的生产加工方法（PR PPMs），如禁止肉类生产使用生长激素或蔬菜种植使用农药；二是不影响（或可忽略影响）产品特性的生产加工方法（nPR PPMs），如要求金枪鱼捕捞船使用海豚友好型渔网。后者比前者更具争议性。. . 本研究据此聚焦于单边非产品相关PPM措施应对非贸易关切的三大核心问题：一是此类措施与WTO协定义务的一致性（见第一部分）；二是其他国际协定对此类措施的相关性（见第二部分）；三是此类措施的经济效能及对发展中国家的影响。研究主要结合实施克拉默生物质可持续标准（现有/拟议/假设性措施）及动物福利保护措施展开分析。
