This paper looks at the extent to which the shift in the lower value added production to countries in the following development “tier” is actually becoming a reality. Several countries in East Asia have been upgrading production patterns and moving up the value chain, this paper looks at how this helps and offers new opportunities to less advanced countries to integrate in world trade. The paper uses a combination of techniques, from an analysis of disaggregated trade flows by country and sectors, to the calculation of trade intensity indices by country and sector, and value-added trade by sector. It finds combined evidence of forward and backward trade increasing between several neighbouring Asian economies and China, in the most labour-intensive industries in particular. Econometric analysis shows that relative unit labour costs are an explanatory factor of increased trade links. In cases, the intensification of trade links on the export side can relate to a strongly expanding local market (for example India for electronic products such as smartphones), but mostly the intensification of trade links takes place both on the import and export sides with markets which are much smaller than China (Vietnam, Bangladesh, etc.), and which experienced increased outward-processing activities as a result of China's production upgrade.

本文探讨了低附加值生产向下一发展“梯队”国家转移的程度是否正在成为现实。东亚多个国家正通过升级生产模式向价值链上游攀升，研究分析了这一趋势如何为欠发达国家融入世界贸易提供助力与新机遇。论文综合运用多种分析方法，包括分国别和行业的贸易流量解析、国别与行业的贸易强度指数测算，以及分行业的增加值贸易核算。研究发现，在劳动密集型产业领域，多个亚洲邻近经济体与中国之间的前向和后向贸易均呈现增长态势。计量经济分析表明，相对单位劳动力成本是贸易联系增强的解释性因素。某些情况下，出口端贸易联系的强化可能与快速扩张的本地市场相关（如印度智能手机等电子产品市场），但多数贸易联系的增强同时发生在进出口两端，且对象是远小于中国规模的市场（如越南、孟加拉等国），这些国家因中国产业升级而承接了更多外包加工活动。
