The study aims at ascertaining whether a relationship exists between the liquidity risk and the interest rate risk of credit institutions. By analysing the balance sheet of a small Italian bank during the years 2009 and 2010, we outlined its liquidity profile, the variables that influenced its dynamics and their effects on the bank’s global management, with particular attention to the interest margin and the interest rate risk in the banking book. We would like to fill a gap identified in the literature, shedding light on how a set of decisions designed mainly to reduce the liquidity risk and comply with the new parameters established by the Basel III Framework enables a more effective management of the regulatory capital and helps the bank to achieve a solid balance between profitability and solvency. Our main findings demonstrate that the bank succeeded in modifying its liquidity profile in order to comply with the incoming constraints imposed by the Basel III framework; the actions taken to reduce the liquidity risk also lowered its interest margin, but also enabled the bank to reduce the amount of capital absorbed by the interest rate risk, giving rise to a globally positive effect.

本研究旨在确定信贷机构的流动性风险与利率风险之间是否存在关联。通过分析一家意大利小型银行2009至2010年间的资产负债表，我们勾勒出该行的流动性状况、影响其动态变化的变量及其对银行整体管理的影响，尤其关注银行账簿中的净息差与利率风险。我们试图填补现有文献的空白，揭示一系列主要为降低流动性风险并满足《巴塞尔协议III》新规要求的决策，如何能更有效地管理监管资本，并帮助银行在盈利性与偿付能力之间实现稳固平衡。主要研究结果表明：该银行成功调整了流动性状况以符合《巴塞尔协议III》即将实施的约束要求；降低流动性风险的相关举措虽减少了净息差，但同时减少了利率风险所占用的资本金额，从而产生了整体积极效应。
