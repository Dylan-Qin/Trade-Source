The observed phenomenon is that projects in general are failing, and though professional associations have been upgrading project management standards, methodologies and tools, these efforts have not contributed to a general increase in project management success. Projects, systems, products and services are becoming more complex, which inevitably leads to competency and maturity issues. Constant project failures raise questions about the current project risk management concepts, practices, people, behaviour, contextual, and technology issues required to achieve consistency and the successful delivery of projects.An inquiry into Eskom, South Africa’s dominant electricity generator and supplier, found that the conventional project management processes aggravate the risk of management incompetence when dealing with complex projects where uncertainty and risk are perceived to be higher. When training project risk management practitioners, Eskom does not apply a holistic approach that considers the impact of complexity, maturity and competency on projects and their performance. The skills and competency requirements are not stipulated when the risk advisor moves to a more senior advisory role in low-complexity projects, and from there into high-complexity projects. Eskom’s ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to competency development does not consider the fact that projects have different complexities.The researcher sought to ascertain whether there is a relationship between complexity, maturity and competency in project risk management and if so, to determine whether such a relationship affects the performance of projects.An interpretive and subjective research philosophy was adopted, using inductive reasoning and a qualitative research approach to probe the literature. The researcher applied field research with participative action research for the interviews and a qualitative survey to collect data and verify the findings of the literature review. A semi-structured questionnaire was used for in-depth interviews with six Eskom senior managers. Stratified sampling was used for the collection of data from 207 Eskom project risk management practitioners. They were invited to respond to the web-based survey comprising a questionnaire with multiple-choice questions on project and project risk management. Eighty project risk management practitioners responded to the survey. Further, a checklist of possible project risk management competencies was emailed to project management experts in Eskom and national and international project management associations for their input.Thematic analysis and content analysis were applied as the qualitative method of analysis. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and coded, and the web-based survey responses were categorised, analysed and interpreted to create an analytical narrative about the present project and project risk management situation in Eskom. The themes or commonalities discovered in the literature and field research, as well as the competency unit criteria from the updated checklist, was used to populate three matrices (technical, contextual and behavioural) for comparison purposes.The research findings indicated that project complexity is driven by the interaction of management, systems and the product delivered. All projects have some level of complexity and Eskom should acknowledge differing complexities. Competency development includes the development of technical, contextual and behavioural competencies. Most importantly, there is a notable relationship between complexity, maturity and competency in the project environment. These findings led to the creation of a sense-making framework in which the relationships between the research elements, their sub-elements and project risk management were combined to indicate how such a relationship could lead to the successful execution of projects. The final outcome of the research is a competency framework to guide the development of project risk practitioners.Recommendations from the research findings are that project performance can be improved by constantly enhancing the competencies of project risk practitioners and by introducing a defined career path in which the different types of projects are considered. Eskom should instil a project risk management culture to ensure maturity of the organisation and sensitivity to the varying levels of complexity in projects.

观察到的现象是，项目普遍面临失败，尽管专业协会一直在升级项目管理标准、方法和工具，但这些努力并未推动项目管理成功率的整体提升。项目、系统、产品和服务正变得日益复杂，这不可避免地引发了能力与成熟度问题。持续的项目失败引发了对当前项目风险管理理念、实践、人员、行为、环境及技术问题的质疑——这些要素本应确保项目交付的一致性与成功。对南非主要电力供应商Eskom的调查发现，在处理不确定性和风险更高的复杂项目时，传统项目管理流程会加剧管理失能的风险。Eskom在培训项目风险管理从业者时，并未采用综合考虑复杂性、成熟度及能力对项目及其表现影响的整体方法。当风险顾问从低复杂度项目晋升至高级顾问职位，再进入高复杂度项目时，其技能与能力要求缺乏明确规定。Eskom"一刀切"的能力发展模式忽视了项目复杂程度的差异性。研究者试图验证项目风险管理中复杂性、成熟度与能力之间是否存在关联，并探究这种关联是否影响项目表现。研究采用解释性主观哲学，通过归纳推理与定性方法梳理文献，结合参与式行动研究的实地访谈及定性调查收集数据。半结构化问卷用于对6名Eskom高管的深度访谈，分层抽样则用于收集207名Eskom项目风险管理从业者的数据，其中80人完成了包含多选题的在线调查。另将项目风险管理能力清单通过邮件发送给Eskom及国内外项目管理协会专家征求意见。采用主题分析与内容分析等定性方法处理数据：访谈记录经转录编码，网络调查反馈经分类解析，最终形成关于Eskom当前项目及风险管理现状的分析报告。通过文献与实地研究发现的共性主题，结合更新后的能力清单标准，研究者构建了技术、情境和行为三维矩阵进行对比。研究发现：项目复杂性由管理、系统及交付产品的交互作用驱动；所有项目均存在复杂度差异，Eskom需正视这一点；能力发展应涵盖技术、情境及行为维度；最重要的是，项目环境中复杂性、成熟度与能力存在显著关联。这些发现促成构建意义建构框架，将研究要素及其子要素与项目风险管理的关系整合，揭示其如何推动项目成功实施。最终成果是指导风险从业者发展的能力框架。研究建议：通过持续提升风险从业者能力，并建立考虑项目类型差异的明确职业路径，可改善项目表现；Eskom应培育风险管理文化，以提升组织成熟度及对项目复杂性的敏感度。
