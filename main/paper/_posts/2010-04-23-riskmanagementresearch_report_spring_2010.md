Risk Management Research Report (RMRR) surveys and screens the flow of academic articles on risk management and presents extended scholarly summaries of today’s most important scholarly work in a convenient format on a timely basis. Each issue features approximately 15 of the most important scholarly articles in risk management published within the preceding quarter. For each of these articles, RMRR presents an extended summary of about 500-800 words, which contrasts with the brief (approximately 150-word) abstracts that typically accompany publication. The purpose of each summary is to provide a substantive understanding of the content of the article.

《风险管理研究报告》（RMRR）对风险管理领域的学术论文流进行调研与筛选，以便捷的格式及时呈现当今最重要学术成果的深度文献综述。每期精选前季度发表的约15篇风险管理领域核心学术论文，并为每篇提供500-800字的详细摘要——这与常规出版物所附的简短摘要（约150字）形成鲜明对比。每篇综述旨在帮助读者实质性地理解原文内容。
