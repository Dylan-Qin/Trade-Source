Informal risk sharing, an important coping strategy, is mediated by social networks. Does risk sharing extend beyond immediate connections? If so, what is its radius? I examine the radius of risk sharing as a function of network structure. To do so, I employ community detection-a tool imported from network science-and dyadic regression. I nd evidence the radius of risk sharing extends beyond direct connections. Using data from a behavioral experiment in Colombia, I nd that detected community co-membership and distance-2 connections (i.e., friends of friends) explain co-membership in experimental risk sharing groups. Using data from a village census in Tanzania, I nd that distance-2 and 3 connections explain risk sharing transfers, but detected community co-membership does not. I address a crucial issue of network sampling in the Colombia illustration using simulation methods, nding my preferred speci cation is robust to this concern. ese methods may bene t those who seek to understand the quality of risk sharing when risk sharing groups are loosely de ned and illegible to outsiders.

非正式风险分担作为一种重要的应对策略，其运作依赖于社交网络。这种风险分担是否会超越直接关联？如果会，其作用半径有多大？我通过将网络结构作为变量，研究了风险分担的作用范围。为此，我采用了源自网络科学的社区检测工具和二元回归分析。研究发现，风险分担的作用范围确实超越了直接关联。基于哥伦比亚行为实验数据，我发现实验性风险分担小组的成员构成可通过检测到的社区共同隶属关系和二阶连接（即朋友的朋友）来解释。而坦桑尼亚村庄普查数据显示，风险分担转移行为可由二阶和三阶连接解释，但社区共同隶属关系则无此作用。针对哥伦比亚案例中网络抽样的关键问题，我通过模拟方法验证了所选模型的稳健性。这些方法有助于研究者理解当风险分担群体边界模糊且对外界不透明时，其运作质量如何。
