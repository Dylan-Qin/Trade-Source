With the supremacy of globalization under siege, weprovide clarity on the turn of events to facilitate understanding of the concepts involved; we present a robust time-series analysis to determine theextent this trade war between China and the United States brings opportunities for India. We have provided the list of products belonging totechnology and labour-intensive categories that India can further export to the United States and reap the gains before other countries. Timelyenactment of Indian government policies would be prudent to avail India of this opportunity.
