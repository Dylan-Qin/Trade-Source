While the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement has received far more attention, a lesser-known U.S. trade deal has also been reworked. In April of 2017, President Trump proclaimed his displeasure with the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (commonly referred to as “KORUS”), stating, “It was a Hillary Clinton disaster, a deal that should’ve never been made.” Trump said he had told the South Koreans, “We’ll either terminate or negotiate. We may terminate.” This set the wheels in motion for a relatively low-profile trade renegotiation that became Trump’s first trade deal.The renegotiation of KORUS provides a useful example of Trump’s trade dealmaking in practice. As we will show below, the renegotiation made only minor changes to the agreement and could be taken to mean that the reality of Trump’s trade policy may not always match the rhetoric. However, the administration’s concerns about trade with Korea have always been less prominent than its concerns about trade with other trading partners, so the conclusion of the KORUS talks with only small changes may simply be a reflection of the administration’s focus on other areas of trade policy rather than an indication of its general approach to trade policy.

尽管《北美自由贸易协定》的重谈受到了更多关注，但一项鲜为人知的美国贸易协定也经历了重新修订。2017年4月，特朗普总统公开表达对《美韩自由贸易协定》（通常称为"KORUS"）的不满，宣称："这是希拉里·克林顿制造的灾难，本就不该签署的协议。"特朗普表示他已告知韩方："我们要么终止协议，要么重新谈判。我们可能会终止。"这番表态启动了一场相对低调的贸易重谈，最终成为特朗普执政后达成的首项贸易协定。. . KORUS重谈为我们提供了观察特朗普实际贸易谈判策略的典型案例。如下文所述，此次重谈仅对原协定作出细微调整，这可能意味着特朗普贸易政策的实际成效未必总能匹配其激烈言辞。但值得注意的是，美国政府对于韩美贸易的关注度始终低于其对其他贸易伙伴的关切，因此KORUS谈判仅以微调告终，或许只是反映了本届政府将贸易政策重点置于其他领域，而不应被视为其整体贸易方针的体现。
