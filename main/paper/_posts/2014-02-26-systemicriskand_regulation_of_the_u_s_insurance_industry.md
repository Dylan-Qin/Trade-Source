This chapter analyzes the characteristics of U.S. insurers for purposes of determining whether they are systemically risky.  More specifically, primary indicators and contributing factors associated with systemic risk are assessed for the insurance sector. A distinction is made between the core activities of insurers (e.g., underwriting, reserving, claims settlement, etc.) and their non-core activities (such as providing financial guarantees).  Statistical analysis of insurer characteristics and their relationship with a well-known systemic risk measure, SRISK, is provided. The core activities of property-casualty insurers are found not to be systemically risky.  However, we find evidence that some core activities of life insurers, particularly separate accounts and group annuities, may be associated with systemic risk. The non-core activities of both types of insurers can contribute to systemic risk. The study also finds that insurers may be susceptible to intra-sector crises such as reinsurance crises arising from counterparty credit risk. New and proposed state and federal regulations are reviewed in light of the potential for systemic risk for this sector.

本章分析美国保险公司的特征，以判断其是否具有系统性风险。具体而言，评估了保险业与系统性风险相关的主要指标和影响因素。研究区分了保险公司的核心业务（如承保、准备金计提、理赔等）与非核心业务（如提供金融担保）。通过统计分析保险公司特征与知名系统性风险指标SRISK的关系，发现财产意外险公司的核心业务不存在系统性风险，但寿险公司的某些核心业务（特别是独立账户和团体年金）可能具有系统性风险。两类保险公司的非核心业务均可能引发系统性风险。研究还表明保险公司易受行业内部危机影响，例如由交易对手信用风险引发的再保险危机。基于该行业潜在的系统性风险，本章还审视了各州及联邦已实施和拟议的新监管措施。
