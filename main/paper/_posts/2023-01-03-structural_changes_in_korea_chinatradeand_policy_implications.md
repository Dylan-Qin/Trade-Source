Korea and China established formal relations 30 years ago. Vibrant bilateral trade has significantly contributed to the economic growth of both nations. However, a remarkable turning point has occurred recently: Bilateral trade seemed to balance out due to China’s lockdown policy and Korea’s stronger corporate competitiveness, but Korea has posted a trade deficit with China since last year for all goods except semiconductors. Such a deficit could signal the beginning of structural change, though the figure over the last four months might be a temporary phenomenon.Over the last 30 years, high-tech industries have played an increasingly important role in bilateral trade in both exports and imports. In exports, semiconductors, petrochemicals, and displays have leading positions but in imports, Korean manufacturing is highly dependent on China, which is expanding into other industries. That means Korea is increasingly reliant on components or raw materials from China, leading to greater risk factors.To effectively respond to the short-term deficit and mid- to long-term structural changes in trade with China, Korea must diversify its import partners, even if doing so is likely to incur high costs in the short term. In the mid-term, the country should develop overseas resources and change its strategic approach to the global market, which should be framed as economic blocs, rather than as a single entity. Over the long term, Korea must strengthen its industrial competitiveness and foster high-tech human resources to secure key technologies to maintain its comparative advantage over China.For the first time in its modern trade with China, Korea recorded a trade deficit for four consecutive months, representing reversal major reversal of roles: Korea had in the past recorded enormous trade surpluses in the tens of billions of USD. Thus looking at the trade deficit with China provides an opportunity to consider changes in the bilateral trade balance, the reasons for these changes, and potential responses to them.

韩中两国建交30年来，充满活力的双边贸易为两国经济增长作出了重要贡献。但近期出现了一个显著转折点：受中国防疫封控政策和韩国企业竞争力增强影响，双边贸易原本看似趋于平衡，然而自去年起除半导体外所有商品对华贸易均转为逆差。这一逆差可能预示着结构性变化的开端，尽管过去四个月的数据或许只是暂时现象。过去30年间，高科技产业在双边贸易进出口中的比重持续提升。出口方面半导体、石油化工和显示器占据主导地位，但进口领域韩国制造业对中国依赖度极高，且这种依赖正蔓延至其他产业。这意味着韩国对中国产零部件和原材料的依存度日益加深，风险因素不断累积。为有效应对对华贸易短期逆差和中长期结构性变化，韩国必须推动进口来源多元化，即便短期内可能承受较高成本。中期来看，应加快海外资源开发，并将全球市场按经济区块而非单一实体重新制定战略布局。长期而言，必须强化产业竞争力，培育高科技人才以掌握关键技术，维持对中国的比较优势。韩国在现代对华贸易史上首次出现连续四个月逆差，标志着双方角色发生重大逆转——过去韩国曾创下数百亿美元的巨额顺差。因此审视对华贸易逆差现象，为我们提供了思考双边贸易格局变迁、成因及应对策略的重要契机。
