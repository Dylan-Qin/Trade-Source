We employ model predictive control for a multi-period portfolio optimization problem. In addition to the mean-variance objective, we construct a portfolio whose allocation is given by model predictive control with a risk-parity objective, and provide a successive convex program algorithm that provides 30 times faster and robust solutions in the experiments.Computational results on the multi-asset universe show that multi-period models perform better than their single period counterparts in out-of-sample period, 2006-2020.The out-of-sample risk-adjusted performance of both mean-variance and risk-parity formulations beat the fix-mix benchmark, and achieve Sharpe ratio of 0.64 and 0.97, respectively.

我们对多周期投资组合优化问题采用模型预测控制方法。除均值-方差目标外，我们还构建了一个通过模型预测控制实现风险平价配置的投资组合，并提出了一种连续凸规划算法，实验表明该算法求解速度提升30倍且结果稳健。多资产领域的计算结果显示，在2006-2020年样本外测试期间，多周期模型表现优于单周期模型。均值-方差与风险平价策略的样本外风险调整后表现均超越固定混合基准，分别实现0.64和0.97的夏普比率。
