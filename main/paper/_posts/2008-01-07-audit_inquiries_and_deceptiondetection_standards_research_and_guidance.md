During each phase of the audit members of the engagement team pose numerous questions, the answers to which may affect both the course and outcome of the audit. The authors posit that an understanding of the psychology of lying may provide auditors with an additional tool with which to evaluate verbal responses to audit inquiries and thereby lessen detection risk. A large body of literature suggests that people are only about 4% better than chance at identifying deception. Additionally, most people hold stereotypical views about the indicators of deception, such as a lack of eye contact indicates deception. Unfortunately, research has found many of these stereotypical views to be invalid indicators of deception. The paper concludes by exploring 6 guidelines that may assist auditors in making more accurate judgments of truth or deception.

在审计的每个阶段，项目组成员会提出大量问题，这些问题的答案可能影响审计的进程和结果。作者认为，理解说谎心理可以为审计师提供额外的工具，用以评估对审计询问的口头回应，从而降低检查风险。大量文献表明，人们在识别欺骗方面的准确率仅比随机猜测高出约4%。此外，大多数人对欺骗的指示持有刻板印象，例如缺乏眼神接触意味着欺骗。遗憾的是，研究发现许多这类刻板印象并非有效的欺骗指标。本文最后探讨了六条准则，可能帮助审计师更准确地判断真伪。
