U.S. soybean farmers have faced multiple headwinds since 2018, given slowing global demand, rising stock levels, and lower prices for their commodity. As exports to their largest market, China, dropped by 75% (y/y) in 2018 amidst rising trade tensions, U.S. soy farmers have sought new ways to stay competitive. This has included participating in new U.S. government aid programs, slashing prices, and finding new markets. Even if trade tensions subside, it has been observed that (1) pricing is not the only determinant of competitiveness in China’s market; (2) alternative suppliers (e.g., from Brazil) can serve as at least temporary substitutes; and (3) China’s state‐owned enterprises are highly responsive to their government’s changing positions on soy.

自2018年以来，由于全球需求放缓、库存水平上升和大豆价格下跌，美国豆农面临多重阻力。随着贸易紧张局势加剧，2018年对最大市场中国的出口同比骤降75%，美国豆农开始寻求保持竞争力的新途径。这包括参与新的美国政府援助计划、大幅降价以及开拓新市场。即便贸易紧张缓解，观察发现：(1)价格并非中国市场竞争力的唯一决定因素；(2)替代供应商（如巴西）至少可充当临时替代选项；(3)中国国有企业对政府大豆政策变化的响应极为迅速。
