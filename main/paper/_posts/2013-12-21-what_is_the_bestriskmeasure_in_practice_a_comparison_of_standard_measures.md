Expected Shortfall (ES) has been widely accepted as a risk measure that is conceptually superior to Value-at-Risk (VaR). At the same time, however, it has been criticised for issues relating to backtesting. In particular, ES has been found not to be elicitable which means that backtesting for ES is less straightforward than, e.g., backtesting for VaR. Expectiles have been suggested as potentially better alternatives to both ES and VaR. In this paper, we revisit commonly accepted desirable properties of risk measures like coherence, comonotonic additivity, robustness and elicitability. We check VaR, ES and Expectiles with regard to whether or not they enjoy these properties, with particular emphasis on Expectiles. We also consider their impact on capital allocation, an important issue in risk management. We find that, despite the caveats that apply to the estimation and backtesting of ES, it can be considered a good risk measure. As a consequence, there is no sufficient evidence to justify an all-inclusive replacement of ES by Expectiles in applications. For backtesting ES, we propose an empirical approach that consists in replacing ES by a set of four quantiles, which should allow to make use of backtesting methods for VaR.

预期缺口（ES）作为一种风险度量指标，已被广泛认为在概念上优于风险价值（VaR）。然而与此同时，它也因与回测相关的问题而受到批评。特别是，ES被发现不具备可引出性，这意味着对ES进行回测不如对VaR进行回测那样直接。期望损失被提出作为ES和VaR的潜在更优替代方案。本文重新审视了风险度量普遍认可的理想特性，如一致性、共单调可加性、稳健性和可引出性。我们检验了VaR、ES和期望损失是否具备这些特性，尤其侧重于期望损失。我们还探讨了它们对资本配置的影响，这是风险管理中的一个重要问题。我们发现，尽管ES在估计和回测方面存在注意事项，它仍可被视为一种良好的风险度量。因此，没有足够证据支持在应用中全面用期望损失替代ES。针对ES的回测，我们提出了一种经验方法，即用四个分位数替代ES，这应能利用VaR的回测方法。
