To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies to assess the level of risk management disclosure (RMD) by listed companies in the financial sector in Vietnam. This research evaluates the level of mandatory and discretionary disclosure of risk management in financial statements of Vietnamese financial listed firms. Using the content analysis method, this study has revealed that the level of information disclosure on risk management by those firms is relatively low. The regression analyses demonstrate that RMD level is affected by firm size, solvency, leverage and independent directors.

据我们所知，目前尚无研究评估越南金融行业上市公司的风险管理披露（RMD）水平。本研究评估了越南金融业上市公司财务报表中强制性与自主性风险管理信息披露程度。通过内容分析法，本研究发现这些企业的风险管理信息披露水平相对较低。回归分析表明，公司规模、偿债能力、杠杆率及独立董事等因素对RMD水平具有显著影响。
