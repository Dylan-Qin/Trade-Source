We assess the impact of internet connectivity and digital trade policies on trade and welfare.  Using a bilateral measure of internet connectivity, we find a significant positive relationship between the internet and both domestic and international trade for goods and services---at the both the intensive and extensive margin.  We also find that digital trade facilitation provisions in trade agreements have significantly increased trade in services but not goods. These findings highlight that digital trade determinants play different roles for goods and services: the internet is beneficial for goods trade but critical for services. Finally, using a general equilibrium model of trade, we assess the trade and welfare impacts of increased internet connectivity in developing countries and find that increases in internet use can have large positive impacts on poorly connected countries. However, it also highlights the danger of developing countries falling behind as the digital economy continues to grow.

我们评估了互联网连接和数字贸易政策对贸易与福利的影响。通过采用双边互联网连接指标，我们发现互联网与商品及服务的国内国际贸易（包括集约边际和扩展边际）均存在显著正向关联。研究还表明，贸易协定中的数字贸易便利化条款显著促进了服务贸易，但对商品贸易影响有限。这些发现凸显出数字贸易决定因素对商品和服务具有不同作用：互联网对商品贸易有益，但对服务贸易至关重要。最后，我们运用贸易一般均衡模型评估了发展中国家提升互联网连接度对贸易和福利的影响，发现互联网使用率的提升能为网络基础设施薄弱的国家带来巨大积极影响。但研究也警示，随着数字经济持续发展，发展中国家存在进一步落后的风险。
