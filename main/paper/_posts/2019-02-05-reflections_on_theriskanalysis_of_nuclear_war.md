This paper presents reflections on the use of risk analysis for understanding and informing policy decisions about nuclear war. A quantitative evaluation of risk arguably should be central to many important nuclear weapons decisions, such as disarmament and launch alert status, because these decisions involve tradeoffs between different risks. However, nuclear war is a difficult risk to analyze, little effort has been made to analyze it, and nuclear war policy decisions have made little use of risk analysis. The paper demonstrates this via a detailed review of the nuclear war risk literature, a summary of a new model for nuclear war risk produced by the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute, and a discussion of the use of risk analysis in nuclear war decision-making. Despite the challenges, there are significant opportunities for progress on both the analysis and the decision-making. The paper finds that, at this time, the limiting factor is mainly the use of risk analysis for decision-making, such that people working on nuclear war risk should emphasize outreach to decision-makers. The paper’s discussion is of relevance for guiding efforts to understand and reduce nuclear war risk, and is likewise applicable to many other risks, especially other global catastrophic risks.

本文探讨了运用风险分析来理解和指导核战争政策决策的思考。定量风险评估理应成为许多重要核武器决策的核心，例如裁军和发射警戒状态，因为这些决策涉及不同风险之间的权衡。然而，核战争是一种难以分析的风险，相关分析工作鲜有开展，且核战争政策决策也极少运用风险分析。本文通过详细梳理核战争风险文献、总结全球灾难性风险研究所提出的新型核战争风险模型，并讨论风险分析在核战争决策中的应用，对此进行了论证。尽管存在挑战，但在风险分析和决策应用方面仍存在重大发展机遇。研究发现，当前限制因素主要在于决策过程中对风险分析的运用，因此核战争风险研究者应着重加强与决策者的沟通。本文的讨论对指导核战争风险认知与降低工作具有现实意义，其方法论同样适用于其他诸多风险领域，尤其是其他全球性灾难风险。
