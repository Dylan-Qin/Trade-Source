Medical detection dogs are used to remotely detect a range of diseases (biodetection) and assist patients with chronic conditions. There has been little research on the behavioural traits linked to good performance for either of these roles.We developed a survey to investigate which behavioural attributes are most important in Medical detection dogs and to examine how these attributes vary between dogs used for biodetection and medical alert assistance tasks.The survey was completed by 62 professionals from 16 different countries. Participants considered 40 behavioural traits for each rating: importance during selection, the ideal level required, and the level shown by a dog with which they had recently worked. Overall, 39 respondents rated assistance dogs and 23 rated biodetection dogs.The most important traits were 'Level of motivation when working' (on a scale of 1-5 mean=4.66±0.51), 'Health' (4.60±0.62), 'Ability to learn from being rewarded' (4.57±0.57), 'Concentration' (4.57±0.60) and 'Acuity of sense of smell' (4.5±0.76). Trait importance differed significantly between the two roles; 'Level of Attachment to human partner' (U=685, p=0.001), 'Confidence in different environments' (U=604 p=0.002) and 'Travel ability' (U=576, p=0.018) were deemed significantly more important for assistance dogs. 'Acuity of sense of smell' (U=280, p=0.004), 'Tendency to be distracted when working' (U=279.5 p=0.009) and 'Ability to solve problems when working' (U=310 p=0.009) were more important for biodetection dogs.Ideal levels also differed between the roles, for example. biodetection dogs were thought to require higher levels of 'Tendency to search by smell alone' (U=277.5 p=0.006) but lower levels of 'Attachment to human partner' (U=277.5 p <0.001) than assistance dogs. When comparing ratings for the current dogs to the perceived ideal levels, there were significant deviations in several traits; e.g., dogs were generally rated as having higher than desired levels of 'General excitability' (mean deviation=1.02) and 'Tendency to be distracted when working' (mean deviation=1.00).Paying particular attention to important traits and those that differ greatly from ideal levels when selecting Medical detection dogs may aid in improving task success. Differences between Medical detection dog tasks must be considered during selection if subsequent performance is to be optimised.

医疗检测犬用于远程检测多种疾病（生物检测）并协助慢性病患者。关于这两种角色表现优异所关联的行为特质，目前研究甚少。我们设计了一项调查，旨在探究哪些行为属性对医疗检测犬最为重要，并比较这些属性在生物检测犬与医疗警报辅助犬之间的差异。来自16个国家的62位专业人员完成了调查。参与者针对40项行为特质分别评估了：选拔时的重要性、理想水平要求，以及近期合作犬只的实际表现水平。其中39名受访者评估辅助犬，23名评估生物检测犬。. . 最重要的特质包括"工作动机水平"（1-5分量表，均值=4.66±0.51）、"健康状况"（4.60±0.62）、"奖励学习能力"（4.57±0.57）、"专注力"（4.57±0.60）和"嗅觉敏锐度"（4.5±0.76）。两项职能的特质重要性存在显著差异："对人类伙伴的依恋程度"（U=685，p=0.001）、"不同环境下的自信心"（U=604，p=0.002）和"长途适应能力"（U=576，p=0.018）对辅助犬更为重要；而"嗅觉敏锐度"（U=280，p=0.004）、"工作时分心倾向"（U=279.5，p=0.009）和"工作中问题解决能力"（U=310，p=0.009）对生物检测犬更重要。. . 理想水平也存在职能差异：例如生物检测犬需要更高的"纯嗅觉搜索倾向"（U=277.5，p=0.006），但低于辅助犬的"人类伙伴依恋程度"（U=277.5，p<0.001）。比较现役犬只与理想水平时，多项特质存在显著偏差：如犬只普遍在"总体兴奋度"（平均偏差=1.02）和"工作时分心倾向"（平均偏差=1.00）上高于理想值。. . 选拔医疗检测犬时，特别关注重要特质及与理想水平差距较大的特质，可能有助于提升任务成功率。若要优化后续表现，选拔过程中必须考虑不同医疗检测犬任务间的差异性。
