This paper covers the use of biometrics, genetics (and the future use of genomics), “profiling”, and other new (and not-so-new) technologies, for the purposes of identification, behavioural  analysis  and risk  detection. After an introduction in section 1,  section 2 discusses existing and emerging technologies for the capturing of still or moving images and other biometric data, and the limitations in their use for full identification.  It then focuses on the new technologies used for their analysis, before critically examining the claim that these new technologies and processes are able to detect actual or future security risks from the (measurements of the) attributes or behaviour of the persons concerned.  It concludes that many of the new technoligies are little more than "snake oil". Section 3 sets out the data protection (informational privacy) issues that arise in this respect, starting with questions of definition, and then moving to the application of the rules in the current main European instrument in this field, Directive 95/46/EC including the in-principle prohibition in the Directive of the use of “fully automated decisions”. Section 4 sets out conclusions and recommendations. A short and somewhat eclectic bibliography is attached.

本文探讨了生物识别技术、遗传学（及未来基因组学的应用）、“特征分析”以及其他新兴（或非全新）技术在身份识别、行为分析和风险检测方面的运用。第一章引言后，第二章首先讨论了用于采集静态/动态图像及其他生物特征数据的现有及新兴技术，并指出其在完整身份识别应用中的局限性；随后重点分析了用于数据解析的新技术，同时批判性审视了"这些新技术及流程能通过（测量）相关人员的属性或行为来识别实际或潜在安全风险"的主张，最终指出许多新技术不过是"江湖骗术"。第三章阐述了由此引发的数据保护（信息隐私）问题：从概念界定入手，进而分析欧盟现行核心法规《95/46/EC指令》的适用规则，包括该指令对"全自动化决策"的原则性禁止。第四章提出结论与建议。文末附有简要且略兼收并蓄的参考文献目录。
