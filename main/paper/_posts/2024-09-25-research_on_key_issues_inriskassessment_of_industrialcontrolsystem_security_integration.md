With the deepening integration of industrialization and informatization, Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are facing more new threats and risks while improving efficiency, and security risks affect system safety. Risk assessment is an important component of the security defense system, so it is crucial to conduct research on security risk assessment of industrial control systems.Due to the mutual influence between safety risks and security risks, simply conducting safety risk assessment or security risk assessment on the system is no longer sufficient to meet the needs of the new situation. It is urgent to conduct research on security integration risk assessment of the system.This article first systematically analyzes and judges the typical international and national standards for ICS safety, security, and security integration;Then, based on this, the key issues of the risk assessment method for industrial control system security integration were analyzed and identified: definition of security integration risk, analysis of risk propagation path, calculation of risk propagation path possibility, and quantification of security event loss value. Among them, risk definition is the foundation;Then, a comprehensive and systematic review of the research status of these four key issues was conducted,and further summarized and elevated;Finally,the current research challenges and future development directions of integrated security risk assessment were discussed.

随着工业化与信息化的深度融合，工业控制系统(Industrial Control Systems，ICS)在提升效率的同时也面临更多新的威胁与风险，安全问题影响系统安全。风险评估是安全防护体系的重要组成部分，因此开展工业控制系统安全风险评估研究至关重要。由于安全风险与安防风险之间存在相互影响，仅对系统进行安全风险评估或安防风险评估已不足以满足新形势需求，亟需开展系统安防一体化风险评估研究。本文首先对国际国内典型的ICS安全、安防及安防一体化标准进行了系统分析与研判;然后在此基础上分析并识别出工业控制系统安防一体化风险评估方法的关键问题:安防一体化风险定义、风险传播路径分析、风险传播路径可能性计算及安防事件损失值量化。其中，风险定义是基础;然后对这四个关键问题的研究现状进行了全面系统的梳理，并进一步总结与提升;最后探讨了安防一体化风险评估当前的研究难点与未来的发展方向。
