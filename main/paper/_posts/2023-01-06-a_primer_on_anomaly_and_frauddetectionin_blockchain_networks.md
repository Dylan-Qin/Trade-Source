Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger system that allows multiple parties to record and verify transactions in a secure and transparent manner. However, blockchain networks are vulnerable to anomalies and frauds that can have serious consequences for the integrity and security of these networks. In this primer, we provide an overview of the definition and properties of blockchain technology, and discuss the types and examples of anomalies and frauds that occur in these networks. We also examine the techniques and technologies that are used to detect and prevent these attacks, including statistical approaches, machine learning approaches, game-theoretic approaches, digital forensics, reputation-based systems, and risk assessment systems. We present case studies of anomaly and fraud detection in real-world blockchain networks, and discuss the lessons learned from these cases and their implications for future research and practice. We also identify emerging trends and challenges in the field, and discuss potential future research directions and technologies. This primer is intended as a resource for practitioners and researchers in the field of anomaly and fraud detection in blockchain networks, and aims to provide a technical and comprehensive overview of this growing and important field.

区块链技术是一种分布式账本系统，允许多方以安全透明的方式记录和验证交易。然而，区块链网络易受异常和欺诈行为的影响，这些行为可能对网络的完整性和安全性造成严重后果。本入门指南概述了区块链技术的定义与特性，探讨了这些网络中出现的异常和欺诈类型及实例。我们还研究了用于检测和防范此类攻击的技术与方法，包括统计方法、机器学习方法、博弈论方法、数字取证、基于声誉的系统和风险评估系统。通过现实区块链网络中的异常与欺诈检测案例研究，我们总结了经验教训及其对未来研究和实践的启示。此外，我们指出了该领域的新兴趋势与挑战，并探讨了未来潜在的研究方向与技术发展。本指南旨在为区块链网络异常与欺诈检测领域的从业者和研究人员提供参考，力求对这一日益重要且快速发展的领域进行全面技术性概述。
