According to WTO rules, countries are allowed to adopt regulations under the Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary (SPS) and Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) agreements in order to protect human, animal and plant health as well as environment, wildlife and human safety. Our paper offers an analysis of the structure and the importance of these measures in agricultural trade. We cover all notifying countries and products at the HS6 digit level. Results of the inventory approach show that EU countries have the lowest coverage ratios of all OECD countries except South Korea and Turkey. Using gravity equation, we also estimate the stringency of such measures. In contrast with previous works, our equation controls for the bilateral applied tariff protection and uses ad valorem equivalents of SPS and TBT measures. Our results first suggest that these measures have on the whole a negative impact on OECD imports. When we consider different groups of exporting countries, we show that OECD exporters are not significantly affected by SPS and TBTs in their exports to other OECD countries while developing and least developed countries' exports are negatively and significantly affected. Furthermore, EU imports seem to be more negatively influenced by tariffs and SPS & TBTs than imports of other OECD countries. Finally, our sectoral analysis suggests an equal distribution of negative and positive impacts of NTBs on agricultural trade.

根据世贸组织规则，各国可依据《卫生与植物检疫措施协定》（SPS）和《技术性贸易壁垒协定》（TBT）制定法规，以保护人类、动植物健康及环境、野生动植物和人类安全。本文分析了这些措施在农产品贸易中的结构及重要性，涵盖所有通报国及HS六位码商品。清单分析法结果显示，除韩国和土耳其外，欧盟国家在经合组织中的措施覆盖率最低。通过引力模型，我们还评估了此类措施的严格程度。与既往研究不同，本模型控制了双边适用关税保护水平，并采用SPS与TBT措施的从价税等值。研究首先表明，这些措施总体上对经合组织进口呈负面影响。按出口国分组分析显示，经合组织成员对同体系国家的出口未受SPS与TBT显著影响，而发展中国家和最不发达国家出口则遭受显著负面冲击。此外，欧盟进口受关税及SPS与TBT的负面影响较其他经合组织国家更为显著。最后，部门分析表明非关税壁垒对农业贸易的负面与正面影响分布均衡。
