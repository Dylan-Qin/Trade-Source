While Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) has emerged as a focus of attention in the context of corporate governance in recent years, the implementation of ERM by Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) has garnered relatively little attention from lawmakers and regulators. To rectify this gap, this chapter explores two important ERM issues applicable to SMEs. First, we examine the integration of ERM principles in the operations of SMEs, specifically including the implementation of legal risk management, and describe the structural and attitudinal factors that hinder its effectiveness. Second, we examine ERM-oriented corporate governance regulations, and consider their potential usefulness to SMEs. Drawing from our analysis of these two issues, we suggest ways in which SMEs can more effectively implement and use ERM.

尽管近年来企业风险管理（ERM）已成为公司治理领域关注的重点，但中小型企业（SMEs）实施ERM的情况却较少受到立法者和监管机构的重视。为弥补这一不足，本章探讨了适用于中小型企业的两个重要ERM议题。首先，我们研究了ERM原则在中小企业运营中的整合问题，特别包括法律风险管理的实施，并分析了阻碍其有效性的结构性和观念性因素。其次，我们考察了以ERM为导向的公司治理法规，并评估其对中小企业的潜在价值。基于对这两个议题的分析，我们提出了中小企业更有效实施和运用ERM的建议。
