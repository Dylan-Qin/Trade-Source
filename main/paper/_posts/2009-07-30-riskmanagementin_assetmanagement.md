Investors are natural risk bearers, in part due to the vast array of risk management tools available to them. These tools allow a risk budgeting process that de-couples the asset allocation and active bets taken in the portfolio. The risk of non-traded assets in the portfolio can be reduced by selective hedging and insurance products. Non-traded assets and a dynamic risk/return tradeoff lead to horizon specific asset allocation.  Portfolios should be constructed to account for the systematic shifts in asset liquidity.

投资者天生是风险的承担者，部分原因在于他们拥有多种风险管理工具可供使用。这些工具使得风险预算流程能够将资产配置与投资组合中的主动押注分离。通过选择性对冲和保险产品，可以降低投资组合中非交易资产的风险。非交易资产以及动态的风险/回报权衡导致了特定投资期限的资产配置。构建投资组合时应考虑资产流动性的系统性变化。
