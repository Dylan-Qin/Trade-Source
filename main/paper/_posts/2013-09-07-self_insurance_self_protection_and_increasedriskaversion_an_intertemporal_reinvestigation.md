This paper studies the effect of increased risk aversion on self-insurance and self-protection in a two-period expected utility framework in which the risk-reducing investment precedes its effect. In contrast to monoperiodic models, self-insurance and self-protection react very similarly to an increase in risk aversion, i.e., increased risk aversion is associated with more effort if and only if current consumption is sufficiently large. Only if savings are endogenized, the classical findings are recouped. Then, increased risk aversion leads to more self-insurance in any case, and increased risk aversion leads to more self-protection if and only if the loss probability is below an endogenous threshold, extending results obtained by Dionne and Eeckhoudt (1985).

本文研究了在两期预期效用框架下，风险厌恶程度增加对自我保险和自我保护的影响，其中风险降低投资先于其效果发生。与单期模型不同，自我保险和自我保护对风险厌恶程度增加的反应非常相似，即只有当当前消费足够大时，风险厌恶程度增加才会与更多努力相关联。只有在储蓄被内生化的情形下，经典结论才能重现。此时，风险厌恶程度增加总会导致更多自我保险；而风险厌恶程度增加导致更多自我保护，当且仅当损失概率低于内生阈值，这扩展了Dionne和Eeckhoudt（1985）的研究成果。
