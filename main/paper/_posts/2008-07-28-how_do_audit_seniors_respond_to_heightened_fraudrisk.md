This paper describes how audit seniors modify a standard audit program in response to heightened fraud risk when cues allow formation of specific hypotheses about the nature of the fraud. We conduct an experiment in which we manipulate provision of information about an internal control material weakness. We find that when fraud risk is heightened by provision of material weakness information, audit seniors’ programs are of lower quality. This occurs because these auditors tend to propose audit program modifications that are not effective in detecting the fraud, resulting in programs that are less efficient. We also investigate determinants of higher quality audit programs, finding that program quality increases as auditors identify more risk factors focused on the specific fraud. These results suggest that identifying risk factors focused on the fraud area is critical to the development of high quality audit plans, and thus to fraud detection.

本文探讨了在存在具体欺诈假设线索的情况下，审计高级人员如何针对升高的欺诈风险修改标准审计程序。我们通过实验操纵了内部控制重大缺陷信息的提供，发现当重大缺陷信息提高欺诈风险时，审计高级人员制定的程序质量较低。这是因为这些审计师倾向于提出无法有效发现欺诈的程序修改方案，导致程序效率下降。我们还研究了高质量审计程序的决定因素，发现当审计师识别出更多针对特定欺诈的风险因素时，程序质量会提高。这些结果表明，聚焦于欺诈领域的风险因素识别对于制定高质量审计计划及发现欺诈至关重要。
