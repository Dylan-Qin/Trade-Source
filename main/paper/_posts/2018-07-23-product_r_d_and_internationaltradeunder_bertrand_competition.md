This study analyzes the equilibrium level of product differentiation, aggregate profit, and aggregate welfare from competition and two types of cooperation in product R&D investments in an international duopoly model under price competition. We show that the equilibrium level of product differentiation can be the highest in the harmonization of product R&D investment; the second highest in the asymmetry of product R&D investment; and the lowest in product R&D competition. We also show that aggregate profit and aggregate welfare under trade liberalization can be the highest in the harmonization of product R&D investment if the difference between the cost of product R&D is sufficiently small, while those under trade liberalization can be greatest in product R&D competition if the difference in cost is sufficiently large enough to reverse the sign.

本研究分析了价格竞争下国际双头垄断模型中产品研发投资竞争与两种合作形式的均衡产品差异化水平、总利润及总福利。研究表明，产品研发投资协调下的均衡差异化水平可能最高，研发投资不对称时次之，而研发竞争时最低。同时发现，若产品研发成本差异足够小，贸易自由化下的总利润和总福利在研发投资协调时可能达到最高；反之，若成本差异足够大以致逆转符号时，研发竞争下的总利润和总福利则可能最大。
