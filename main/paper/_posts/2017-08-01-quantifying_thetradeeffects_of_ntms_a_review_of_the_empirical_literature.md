In recent years, the imposition of Non-Tariff Measures (NTMs) has increased rapidly both in quantity and importance. This development, with its considerable economic impact, particularly within the area of global trade, has prompted numerous scholars to explore the direction and magnitude of the trade effects of NTMs. Moreover, increased efforts are being placed on further exploring the determinants behind the use of NTMs, as well as their policy implications. The current paper aims to survey the empirical trade literature, in order to uncover the available responses to major questions regarding the trade effects of NTMs, principally of TBT and SPS measures. Among the questions posed are: (1) How do specific types of NTMs affect imports and exports? (2) Are developing countries more sensitive to NTMs? (3) Are small-medium sized firms more adversely affected by NTMs? (4) How are particular sectors/products affected by NTMs? And, (5) Do Harmonization and Mutual Recognition necessarily impact trade positively?

近年来，非关税措施（NTMs）在数量和重要性上都迅速增加。这一发展对全球经济，尤其是全球贸易领域产生了重大影响，促使众多学者探究非关税措施对贸易影响的方向和程度。此外，学界正加大力度深入研究非关税措施使用背后的决定因素及其政策含义。本文旨在梳理实证贸易文献，以揭示关于非关税措施（主要是技术性贸易壁垒和卫生与植物检疫措施）贸易效应的核心问题的现有答案。提出的问题包括：（1）特定类型的非关税措施如何影响进出口？（2）发展中国家是否对非关税措施更敏感？（3）中小企业是否更易受到非关税措施的负面影响？（4）特定行业/产品如何受非关税措施影响？（5）协调与互认是否必然对贸易产生积极影响？
