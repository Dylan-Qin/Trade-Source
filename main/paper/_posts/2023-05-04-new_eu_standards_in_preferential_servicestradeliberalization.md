While the EU is exporting more services to non-EU countries (€1.072 trillion in 2019) than it imports, services appear to not particularly enjoy priority in EU preferential trade agreements (PTAs). This chapter assesses the scope of services trade liberalization in EU PTAs by means of legal empirical analysis. Standardization can be found specifically in new EU rules in a number of internet-related services, in delivery services, in temporary movement of natural persons, and in procedures for mutual recognition. A comparison shows that EU PTAs are embedding the proposed Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) scope of liberalization and the recently concluded Joint Initiative on Services Domestic Regulation, while already moving ahead in individual depth of respective obligations. The chapter concludes with a discussion of potential reasons for the relatively unambitious scope of services trade liberalization in EU PTAs vis-à-vis the quite substantive regulatory ambition in selected services sectors.

尽管欧盟向非欧盟国家出口的服务（2019年为1.072万亿欧元）多于进口，但服务贸易似乎并未在欧盟优惠贸易协定（PTAs）中享有特别优先地位。本章通过法律实证分析评估了欧盟PTAs中服务贸易自由化的范围。标准化尤其体现在欧盟多项互联网相关服务、快递服务、自然人临时流动以及相互认可程序的新规则中。比较表明，欧盟PTAs正纳入拟议的《服务贸易协定》（TiSA）的自由化范围及近期达成的《服务国内规制联合倡议》，同时已在各项义务的具体深度上先行一步。本章最后探讨了欧盟PTAs中服务贸易自由化范围相对保守的潜在原因，与部分服务领域相当实质性的监管雄心形成对比。
