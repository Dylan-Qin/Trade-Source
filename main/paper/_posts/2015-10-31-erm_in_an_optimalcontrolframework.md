Much of ERM consists of qualitative discussion of the risks facing a business and controls over them. It is difficult to identify in the literature a clear body of theory to provide the foundation for the subject, integrating a business’s objectives with its risk controls. The present paper attempts this by formulation of ERM as an exercise in stochastic optimal control theory. Here there is a defined objective, which would usually include some aspect of profit, and a set of constraints (the risk controls). Optimal control theory provides a framework for balancing the one against the other, and also for considering whether or not particular risk controls are well advised. The paper accepts the COSO (2004) definition of ERM, and its associated ERM Integrated Framework. After definitions, preliminary discussion and establishment of the control theory set-up, the paper is organised with one section for each item of the ERM Integrated Framework. Each of these sections interprets that item within the control theory model. Risk controls may improve business performance, but they usually come at a cost. And the stronger the control, the greater may be the improvement, but the greater the cost. The essential purpose of the control theoretic formulation is the identification of the optimal strength of each risk control as that at which, for marginal further strengthening, the marginal improvement of business function is matched by marginal cost.

企业风险管理（ERM）很大程度上包含对企业面临风险及其管控措施的定性讨论。现有文献中很难找到一个明确的理论体系，将企业目标与风险控制相结合，从而为该学科奠定基础。本文试图通过将ERM构建为随机最优控制理论的实践来解决这一问题。该理论设定了一个明确目标（通常包含利润要素）和一组约束条件（风险控制措施）。最优控制理论提供了平衡二者关系的框架，同时也能评估特定风险控制措施是否合理。本文采用COSO（2004）对ERM的定义及其配套的《ERM整合框架》。在完成定义、初步讨论和控制理论框架搭建后，论文按照《ERM整合框架》的各个要素分章节展开，每章节均在控制理论模型下解读相应要素。风险控制可能提升企业绩效，但往往伴随成本。控制力度越强，绩效提升可能越大，相应成本也越高。控制理论框架的核心目标在于确定每个风险控制措施的最优强度——即当控制力度边际增强时，业务功能边际改善与控制边际成本达到平衡的临界点。
