The European Union has the ambition to be one of the largest markets and one of the most influential trade actors in the globalized economy, but also the mission to spread the values and principles at the foundations of the European integration process: democracy, the rule of law, respect and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, environmental protection and sustainable development. This twofold mission is at the origin of the measures which are the object of this book. The focus of the research is the role of the Union in pursuing sustainable development and human rights in third countries through unilateral trade instruments and applying different methods of regulation. The study is conducted against the background of international law and of the WTO rules on multilateral trade. It addresses the tension between unilateralism and multilateralism in EU policies for sustainable development, with a focus on the problematic issue of the extraterritorial reach of EU measures.

欧盟志在成为全球化经济中最大的市场之一和最具影响力的贸易行为体之一，同时也肩负着传播欧洲一体化进程根基的价值观与原则的使命：民主、法治、尊重和保护人权与基本自由、环境保护与可持续发展。这一双重使命正是本书所探讨措施的起源。研究聚焦于欧盟如何通过单边贸易工具及运用不同监管方法，在第三国推进可持续发展与人权。这项研究以国际法和世贸组织多边贸易规则为背景，探讨了欧盟可持续发展政策中单边主义与多边主义之间的张力，重点关注欧盟措施域外适用这一争议性问题。
