As shareholders and regulators identify risk at every level of corporate operation, general counsels (GCs) see an increasing need for cooperation with in-house intellectual property (IP) counsel. GCs, in demanding higher accountability for a company's IP holdings, require IP counsel to acquire multidisciplinary knowledge in the execution of an offensive risk management strategy that is pertinent to the company's strategic operating plan. From IP counsels' perspective, a comprehensive and successful legal risk management program inherently requires particular attention to the proper preparation of opinions and deliberate drafting of underlying IP rights. These responsibilities, however, should be assumed in combination with non-traditional forums of indemnity and cyberlaw that assist IP counsel in identifying the greatest risks inherent in the company's IP operations. Integration of the IP counsel's traditional means of risk mitigation across different practice areas grants IP counsel the opportunity for multidisciplinary cooperation as part of an overall legal risk management plan that preserves the maximum value of the IP portfolio.

随着股东和监管机构在企业运营的各个层面识别风险，总法律顾问（GCs）愈发认识到与内部知识产权（IP）法律顾问加强合作的必要性。为提升企业对知识产权资产的责任要求，总法律顾问要求IP法律顾问在执行与企业战略运营计划相关的主动风险管理策略时，需具备跨学科知识。从IP法律顾问的角度看，全面且成功的法律风险管理方案必然需要特别注重法律意见书的恰当准备和基础知识产权的审慎撰写。然而，这些职责应与非传统的赔偿机制及网络法律领域相结合，以帮助IP法律顾问识别企业IP运营中固有的重大风险。通过将IP法律顾问传统的风险缓释手段整合至不同业务领域，使其有机会在整体法律风险管理计划框架下开展跨学科协作，从而最大限度维护知识产权组合的价值。
