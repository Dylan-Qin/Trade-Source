Some of the largest global insurers are actively pursuing the recently enacted Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI). While the concept of sustainability is often associated with a governance design that promotes stakeholder value the PSI do not appear to be a call for stakeholder-focused insurers. Rather the PSI appear to be about internalizing tacit claims in the operations of insurers. Conceptual and empirical literature on shareholder value maximization suggests that when an insurer honors its tacit claims the value to shareholders increases. A key insight from practice is that a sincere pursuit of the PSI will expand the scope of corporate risk management.

一些全球大型保险公司正在积极推行最新颁布的《可持续保险原则》。虽然可持续发展理念常与促进利益相关者价值的治理设计相关联，但该原则似乎并非呼吁保险公司以利益相关者为核心。相反，该原则更侧重于将隐性权益要求内化于保险公司的运营中。关于股东价值最大化的理论与实证研究表明，当保险公司履行其隐性权益时，股东价值将随之提升。实践中的关键启示在于：真诚贯彻该原则将拓宽企业风险管理的范畴。
