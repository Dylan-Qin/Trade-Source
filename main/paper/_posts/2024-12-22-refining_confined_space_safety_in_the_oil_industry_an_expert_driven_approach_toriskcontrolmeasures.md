Confined space work in the oil industry remains hazardous despite existing regulations and safety protocols. While adherence is crucial, accident and fatality rates persist. This study addresses this gap by building upon prior research that identified risk factors and control measures. Employing a mixed Delphi-Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique, we consulted nine safety professionals – occupational safety technicians, engineers, and ergonomists. Leveraging their field experience, literature reviews, and expert knowledge, these specialists identified the key risk factors present in oil industry confined spaces and the most appropriate control measures for each. This collaborative approach yielded a comprehensive guide outlining the primary factors and corresponding control measures to enhance safety in confined space operations.

石油行业中的受限空间作业尽管已有相关法规和安全规程，仍然存在危险性。虽然遵守这些规定至关重要，但事故和死亡率依然居高不下。本研究基于先前识别风险因素和控制措施的研究成果，采用德尔菲-层次分析法（AHP）混合技术，咨询了九位安全专业人士——职业安全技术员、工程师和人机工程学专家。这些专家结合现场经验、文献综述和专业知识，识别出石油行业受限空间中的关键风险因素及针对每个因素最适宜的控制措施。通过这种协作方式，最终形成了一份全面指南，详细列出了提升受限空间作业安全性的主要因素及相应控制措施。
