In this paper we propose a unified utility deviation-risk model which covers both utility maximization and mean-variance analysis as special cases. We derive the time-consistent Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for the equilibrium value function and significantly reduce the number of state variables, which makes the HJB equation derived in this paper much easier to solve than the extended HJB equation in the literature. We illustrate the usefulness of the time-consistent HJB equation with several examples which recover the known results in the literature and go beyond, including a mean-variance model with stochastic volatility dependent risk aversion, a utility deviation-risk model with state dependent risk aversion and control constraint, and a constrained portfolio selection model. The numerical and statistical tests show that the utility and deviation-risk have a significant impact on the equilibrium control strategy and the distribution of the terminal wealth.

本文提出了一种统一的效用偏差-风险模型，该模型将效用最大化和均值-方差分析作为特例涵盖其中。我们推导了均衡值函数的时间一致Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman（HJB）方程，并显著减少了状态变量的数量，这使得本文导出的HJB方程比文献中的扩展HJB方程更易于求解。我们通过多个示例说明了时间一致HJB方程的实用性，这些示例不仅重现了文献中的已知结果，还进一步扩展了应用范围，包括具有随机波动率依赖风险厌恶的均值-方差模型、具有状态依赖风险厌恶和控制约束的效用偏差-风险模型，以及一个带约束的投资组合选择模型。数值与统计测试表明，效用和偏差-风险对均衡控制策略及终端财富分布具有显著影响。
