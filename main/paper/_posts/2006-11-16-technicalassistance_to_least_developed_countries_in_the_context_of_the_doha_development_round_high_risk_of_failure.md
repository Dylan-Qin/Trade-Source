In 2002, World Trade Organization (WTO) Members pledged more than 30 million Swiss francs to ensure the achievement of the Doha Development Round (DDR). This amount was meant to finance 514 technical assistance and capacity building activities listed in the WTO Annual Technical Assistance Plan (TAP). In addition, 49 least-developed countries (LDCs) would receive assistance through the Integrated Framework (IF), to help them integrate trade policy into their development strategies. Concerns have arisen as to the scope, effectiveness and efficiency of the IF, as well as other trade-related technical assistance programmes. While the activities planned are laudable, the authors question whether they can be achieved and suggest a reassessment of the IF in order to fulfil the objectives of the DDR.

2002年，世界贸易组织（WTO）成员承诺提供超过3000万瑞士法郎，以确保多哈发展回合（DDR）目标的实现。这笔资金旨在资助WTO年度技术援助计划（TAP）中列出的514项技术援助和能力建设活动。此外，49个最不发达国家（LDC）将通过综合框架（IF）获得援助，以帮助其将贸易政策纳入发展战略。目前各方对IF及其他贸易相关技术援助项目的范围、有效性和效率提出了质疑。尽管规划中的活动值得称赞，但报告作者质疑其可行性，并建议重新评估IF以实现DDR目标。
