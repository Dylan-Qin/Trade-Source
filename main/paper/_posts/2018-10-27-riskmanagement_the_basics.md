The article clarifies the most essential methods for risk management.This includes especially the methods for identification, quantification and simulation based risk aggregation (e.g. monte carlo simulation). It is pointed up that an appropriate quantification of all relevant risks and a risk aggregation by the monte carlo simulation are both crucial for an efficient risk management.Also an impression of the basics for the organization of risk management systems is given and the main aspects of risk coping and risk control are explained.Overall, a modern, „decision-oriented“ risk management is portrayed which is able to predict changes due to decisions in the risk-return profile of the company already during the process of preparing those decisions (e.g. in terms of investment or acquisitions).

文章阐明了风险管理的最基本方法，尤其包括风险识别、量化以及基于模拟的风险聚合方法（如蒙特卡洛模拟）。文中强调，对所有相关风险的适当量化以及通过蒙特卡洛模拟进行风险聚合，对于高效的风险管理至关重要。同时，文章还介绍了风险管理体系组织的基础知识，并解释了风险应对和风险控制的主要方面。总体而言，文章描绘了一种现代、“决策导向型”的风险管理，它能够在决策准备过程中（如投资或收购决策时）预测这些决策对公司风险回报状况的影响变化。
