Supply chain risk management (SCRM) is a nascent area emerging from a growing appreciation for supply chain risk by practitioners and by researchers. However, there is diverse perception of research in supply chain risk because these researchers have approached this area from different domains. This paper presents our study of this diversity from the perspectives of operations and supply chain management scholars: First, we reviewed the researchers’ output, i.e., the recent research literature. Next, we surveyed two focused groups (members of Supply Chain Thought Leaders and International Supply Chain Risk Management groups) with open-ended questions. Finally, we surveyed operations and supply chain management researchers during the 2009 INFORMS meeting in San Diego. Our findings characterize the diversity in terms of three “gaps”: a definition gap in how researchers define SCRM, a process gap in terms of inadequate coverage of response to risk incidents, and a methodology gap in terms of inadequate use of empirical methods. We also list ways to close these gaps as suggested by the researchers.

供应链风险管理(SCRM)是一个新兴领域，源于实践者和研究者对供应链风险日益增长的重视。然而，由于研究者们从不同领域切入，对供应链风险研究的认知存在显著差异。本文从运营与供应链管理学者的视角出发，对这种差异性展开研究：首先梳理了研究者的产出——即近年来的学术文献；其次通过开放式问题调研了两个焦点小组（供应链思想领袖联盟和国际供应链风险管理小组成员）；最后在2009年圣地亚哥INFORMS会议期间对运营与供应链管理学者进行了问卷调查。研究发现这种差异性主要体现在三大"鸿沟"：研究者对SCRM定义的理解鸿沟、风险事件应对措施研究不足的过程鸿沟，以及实证方法运用不足的方法论鸿沟。文中同时列举了研究者提出的弥合这些鸿沟的途径。
