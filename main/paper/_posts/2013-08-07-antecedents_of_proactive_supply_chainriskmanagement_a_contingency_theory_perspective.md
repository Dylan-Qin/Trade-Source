Since supplier insolvencies are a major source of supply chain disruptions, scholars have continuously suggested managing supply chain risk management (SCRM) proactively in order to avoid their occurrence. However, business practice seems to fail with this task. This paper investigates antecedents which foster proactive SCRM implementation from a contingency theory perspective. As a major contingency we choose past supplier insolvencies as an indicator for the level of vulnerability of organisations and investigate inter-organisational, intra-organisational, and individual antecedents. By consulting supply chain management and management accounting literature, hypotheses are developed and tested via content analysis in 63 interviews with representatives from the automotive industry. The findings demonstrate that a mechanistic management control system, a rational cognitive style and relational buyer-supplier relationships have positive impacts on proactively managing supplier insolvency risks. Furthermore, past experience with supplier insolvencies has a moderating, though not a direct, effect on proactiveness. This research suggests that a holistic risk management approach is required to proactively mitigate supplier insolvency risk.

由于供应商破产是供应链中断的主要原因，学者们一直建议主动实施供应链风险管理（SCRM）以避免其发生。然而，商业实践似乎未能完成这一任务。本文从权变理论视角出发，探究了推动主动实施SCRM的前因变量。我们选择过往供应商破产事件作为组织脆弱性水平的主要权变指标，并研究了组织间、组织内及个体层面的前因变量。通过梳理供应链管理和管理会计文献，研究提出假设并采用内容分析法对汽车行业代表的63份访谈数据进行验证。结果表明：机械式管理控制系统、理性认知风格以及买方-供应商关系对主动管理供应商破产风险具有积极影响；此外，过往供应商破产经历虽不直接作用于主动性，但能发挥调节效应。本研究指出，需采用全面风险管理方法才能主动降低供应商破产风险。
