Over the last 15 years, the global trade of virgin olive oil (VOO) seems to face a stringent regulatory regime, mainly through the imposition of TBT and SPS measures. Such a development should have adversely impacted global levels of VOO trade. However, evidence shows that the world’s imports of VOO have more than quadrupled in value since 2000. Alongside this trend, the share of VOO imports gradually shifts from traditional sources (mainly EU) to New World producing countries, such as Argentina, Australia, the USA, and Chile. By extracting data from hundreds of NTM regulations, as well as all possible registered bilateral trade flows between 2002 to 2014, this paper aims to empirically explore to what extent particular NTMs impact imports of VOO. The results indicate that while tariffs remain a stringent barrier, most NTMs have a positive impact on imports, rather than enhancing restrictiveness. The paper asserts that the majority of NTMs respond to consumers’ demand for higher food safety standards and protection of human health, while increasing available information and transparency. That, in turn, leads to an expansion in the magnitude of imports of VOO products.

过去15年间，全球初榨橄榄油贸易似乎面临着严格的监管制度，主要是通过技术性贸易壁垒（TBT）和卫生与植物检疫（SPS）措施的实施。这种发展本应对初榨橄榄油的全球贸易水平产生负面影响。然而，有证据表明，自2000年以来，全球初榨橄榄油进口额已增长了三倍多。与此同时，初榨橄榄油进口来源逐渐从传统产地（主要是欧盟）转向新兴生产国，如阿根廷、澳大利亚、美国和智利。本文通过提取数百项非关税措施（NTM）法规数据以及2002至2014年间所有可能的双边贸易流量记录，旨在实证研究特定非关税措施对初榨橄榄油进口的影响程度。研究结果表明，尽管关税仍是严格壁垒，但大多数非关税措施对进口产生了积极影响，而非增强限制性。本文认为，多数非关税措施响应了消费者对更高食品安全标准和人类健康保护的需求，同时增加了信息透明度和可获得性，这反过来又促使初榨橄榄油产品的进口规模扩大。
