The protectionist trade measures promulgated by U.S. President Donald Trump during his campaign for the presidency in late 2016 have gradually become a legal reality since his inauguration. The continued proliferation of these protectionist measures has been characterized as an irresponsible policy that ignores deleterious economic effects, while others describe them as a predictable result.If the Trump administration’s trade policy is little more than a set of arbitrary determinations made through an irrational decision-making process, as many experts propose, our capability to respond is very limited. On the other hand, if Trump’s trade policy is determined in a lucid way through a prepared process, we can form expectations of what effects such policies might have, and can prepare a systematically-devised response. This study recognizes Trump’s trade policy not as an irrational conviction but rather as something that has been carefully formulated, and aims to find ways to systematically respond to the continuing proliferation of protectionist trade measures.For this study, we will examine current trends in the proliferation of the U.S. government’s protectionist trade policy and its impact on the economy. This will show that there is a high level of concern about Trump’s trade policy within the U.S. itself.

美国总统唐纳德·特朗普在2016年底竞选期间颁布的贸易保护措施，自其就职以来已逐步成为法律现实。这些保护主义措施的持续扩散被描述为忽视有害经济影响的不负责任政策，也有人认为这是可预见的结果。如果如许多专家所言，特朗普政府的贸易政策只是通过非理性决策过程做出的一系列武断决定，那么我们的应对能力将非常有限。反之，若这些政策是通过缜密流程清醒制定的，我们就能预判其可能产生的效应，并制定系统化的应对方案。本研究将特朗普贸易政策视为精心设计的产物而非非理性执念，旨在探索系统应对保护主义贸易措施持续扩散的路径。为此，我们将分析美国政府保护主义贸易政策的蔓延趋势及其经济影响，揭示美国国内对特朗普贸易政策存在高度忧虑的现状。
