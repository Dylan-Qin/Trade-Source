Risk is considered as an inseparable part of any project and since all the effective factors in projects are not predictable, risk management is inevitable. One of the biggest administrative problems with internal projects is the managers’ neglect of the importance of risk management which leads to delay in projects delivery and increase of the cost of the projects. Since not all risks are regarded as threats but also as opportunities, risk management is considered as a balance factor between the loss of threats and the profit earned through opportunities. It has focused on some strategies for successful implementation of risk management in projects as well. In the risk management, the most logical way of planning is managing risk before taking risk. This study investigated risk and risk management, its aims, components, and different stages of risk to reach the expected aims and outcomes of the study.

风险被视为任何项目中不可分割的一部分，由于并非所有项目中的有效因素都可预测，风险管理是不可避免的。内部项目最大的管理问题之一是管理者忽视了风险管理的重要性，这导致项目交付延迟和项目成本增加。由于并非所有风险都被视为威胁，同时也被视为机遇，风险管理被视为威胁造成的损失与通过机遇获得的利润之间的平衡因素。它还关注了一些在项目中成功实施风险管理的策略。在风险管理中，最合理的规划方式是在承担风险之前管理风险。本研究探讨了风险与风险管理、其目标、组成部分以及风险的不同阶段，以达到研究的预期目标和结果。
