Cyber risk poses severe challenges to the society and has become an important theme in risk management and insurance. Yet its statistical features and how it evolves over time are not sufficiently understood. This paper focuses on two key dimensions of cyber risk—loss severity and tail risk—using three different cyber loss databases. We first focus on the dynamics of loss severity, identifying structural shifts in distributions through a Fr´echet-based change point detection method and applying inverse probability weighting to control for selection bias. Our results indicate an increase in the severity of malicious cyber losses since 2018, while negligent cyber incidents have exhibited a declining trend in severity. Then we propose a combined approach with accurate tail index estimation and change point detection and find that cyber loss distributions remain heavy tailed over time, despite heterogeneity across different risk categories. Finally, a numerical analysis is presented to illustrate how losses of a simulated cyber insurance portfolio evolve over time, emphasizing the importance of incorporating the dynamic properties of cyber risk into pricing strategies for insurance companies.

网络风险给社会带来了严峻挑战，已成为风险管理和保险领域的重要议题。然而其统计特征及随时间演变的规律尚未得到充分认知。本文基于三个不同的网络损失数据库，重点研究了网络风险的两个关键维度——损失严重程度与尾部风险。我们首先运用基于Fr´echet分布的变点检测方法识别损失严重度分布的结构性突变，并采用逆概率加权法控制选择偏差。研究发现自2018年以来，恶意网络攻击造成的损失严重程度呈上升趋势，而过失型网络事件的损失严重度则持续下降。随后我们提出一种融合精确尾部指数估计与变点检测的综合分析方法，发现尽管不同风险类别存在异质性，网络损失分布始终保持着厚尾特征。最后通过数值模拟展示了网络保险组合损失的动态演变过程，论证了保险公司在定价策略中纳入网络风险动态特征的重要性。
