We argue for an integrated and decision-oriented enterprise risk management system (ERM), where organizations focus on the drivers of value, rather than risk minimization and make use of quantitative risk aggregation techniques based on the best available information. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is structured along seven areas we see as crucial for the development of ERM systems, supported by a structures literature analysis. Findings: Our literature review makes clear that of the seven areas presented in this article, especially risk aggregation, risk quantification and supporting decision-making are only covered by a minority of the publications. Practical implications: The paper offers valuable insights on how risk management can be linked with strategic decision-making by making use of risk aggregation techniques. Originality: Supported by our literature review, we present seven areas in which more effective risk governance and strengthened resilience can be created. By including these areas, we not only focus on one aspect but take a holistic view on ERM, including cultural, organizational and technical aspects. These arease are also grounded in a robus enterprise framework we lay out.

我们主张建立一个集成且以决策为导向的企业风险管理系统（ERM），其中组织应关注价值驱动因素而非单纯追求风险最小化，并利用基于最佳可用信息的定量风险聚合技术。  . 设计/方法论/方法：分析围绕我们认为对ERM系统发展至关重要的七个领域展开，辅以结构化文献分析作为支撑。  . 研究结果：文献综述表明，本文提出的七个领域中，尤其是风险聚合、风险量化和支持决策方面，仅有少数文献涉及。  . 实践意义：本文通过运用风险聚合技术，为如何将风险管理与战略决策相结合提供了有价值的见解。  . 原创性：基于文献综述，我们提出了七个可提升风险治理效能与增强韧性的关键领域。通过涵盖这些领域，我们不仅聚焦单一维度，而是从文化、组织和技术层面整体审视ERM，这些领域均植根于我们构建的稳健企业框架之中。
