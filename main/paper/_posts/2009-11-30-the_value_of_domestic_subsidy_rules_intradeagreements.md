This paper investigates the efficient design of rules on domestic subsidies in a trade agreement. A clear trade-off emerges from the economic literature. Weak rules may lead Member governments to inefficiently use domestic subsidies for redistributive purposes or to lower market access granted to trading partners once tariffs are bound. On the other hand, excessive rigidity may inhibit tariff negotiations or induce governments to set inefficiently high tariffs, as strict regulations would reduce policy makers' ability to use subsidies to offset domestic market distortions. Efficient subsidy rules are, therefore, the ones that strike the right balance between policy flexibility and rigidity. This economic approach provides a framework to interpret the provisions on domestic subsidies in the WTO.

本文探讨了贸易协定中关于国内补贴规则的高效设计。经济学文献揭示了一个明显的权衡问题：宽松的规则可能导致成员国政府为再分配目的低效使用补贴，或在关税受限后降低给予贸易伙伴的市场准入；而过度严格的规则则会抑制关税谈判，或促使政府设定低效的高关税，因为严苛的监管将削弱政策制定者运用补贴纠正国内市场扭曲的能力。因此，高效的补贴规则应在政策灵活性与刚性之间取得恰当平衡。这一经济学视角为解读世贸组织国内补贴条款提供了分析框架。
