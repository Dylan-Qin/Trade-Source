In early 2013, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations were introduced with great fanfare in President Obama’s State of the Union speech. The world’s two largest economic zones would be united in a trade and investment pact, which would generate new economic growth at a time when it was desperately needed. Negotiations began in July of that year, with promises that this negotiation would not drag on endlessly, as some other trade talks have. We are now just over one year into the process, with the sixth round of talks having just taken place July 14-18 in Brussels and the seventh round to be held from September 29 through October 3 in Washington. It is time for an evaluation of what has been achieved. Are the talks progressing as rapidly as hoped? Are the hurdles surmountable? Will this giant free-trade zone actually come to fruition? This bulletin examines the current state of the TTIP talks relative to expectations and in the larger context of the world trading system. It describes some of the main stumbling blocks that have arisen and makes suggestions for moving the process forward.

2013年初，奥巴马总统在国情咨文演讲中高调宣布启动《跨大西洋贸易与投资伙伴关系协定》（TTIP）谈判。全球两大经济区将通过这项贸易投资协定实现联合，在亟需新增长动力的时期创造经济活力。谈判于当年7月启动，相关方承诺不会像其他贸易谈判那样无限期拖延。如今谈判已进行一年有余，第六轮会谈刚于7月14日至18日在布鲁塞尔结束，第七轮将于9月29日至10月3日在华盛顿举行。现在正是评估阶段性成果的时机：谈判是否如预期般顺利推进？障碍能否被克服？这个巨型自贸区能否真正建成？本期简报结合世界贸易体系大背景，对照预期目标审视TTIP谈判现状，剖析已出现的主要分歧点，并就推动谈判进程提出建议。
