Australia declared services trade liberalisation in Australia-European Union Free Trade Agreement (AUEFTA) negotiations a priority, while an impact assessment by the EU indicated no measurable impact on sectoral output for services in an AEUFTA in services. The two sides will not only have to agree on the relative importance of the services chapter, but also on the type of regulatory structure pursued. At this point, the outcome of negotiations remains unknown. While some elements of substantial liberalisation are expected in the liberalisation of trade in professional services along with temporary movement of persons, and in education services, the currently proposed regulatory structure of the AEUFTA service chapter suggests limited regulatory innovation. However, both parties have confirmed their intention to deepen liberalisation within the scope of their respective schedule of commitments beyond their Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) offers in 2016. Given that both parties have furthermore confirmed their commitment to modernisation and deepening of international rules in services trade liberalisation in the plurilateral forum of TiSA negotiations, the AEUFTA service chapter may therefore serve also as a stepping-stone to subsequent successful conclusion of plurilateral TiSA negotiations.

澳大利亚将澳欧自由贸易协定（AUEFTA）谈判中的服务贸易自由化列为优先事项，而欧盟的一项影响评估显示，该协定对服务业的部门产出无显著影响。双方不仅需就服务章节的相对重要性达成共识，还需协调监管框架的类型。目前谈判结果尚不明朗。尽管专业服务贸易及人员临时流动、教育服务领域有望实现实质性自由化，但现行AUEFTA服务章节的监管框架设计显示制度创新有限。不过，双方已确认将在各自承诺表范围内推进比2016年《服务贸易协定》（TiSA）出价更深入的开放。鉴于两国还承诺在TiSA多边谈判论坛中推动服务贸易自由化规则的现代化与深化，AUEFTA服务章节或将成为后续成功完成TiSA多边谈判的基石。
