These data were collected in 2015 and include ecological information on leafless vanilla plants, as well as anatomical data on their roots, collected at various study sites during the course of this research project. A 50 × 20 m plot was established in a homogeneous zone of vegetation (Braun-Blanquet, 1932), where Vanilla spp. vines were present. The number of plots varied from two to three, depending on the size of the vegetation patches. Each plot was divided into 10 quadrats (10 × 10 m). The number of Vanilla spp. (vines and branches) per plot was recorded. The total length of the vanilla plants was measured. The number of attachment roots (AR) and aerial roots (ER) were counted per individual, and the shape of the AR (flattened or filiform) was noted. Morphological characteristics of the phorophytes were documented, including height, bark texture (smooth or rough), density, and diameter at breast height (DBH), which was measured 1.30 meters above the ground level. The rugosity assessment of the bark was performed by eye and touch. We compared the root anatomical structures of Vanilla spp. in northern and southern regions with high and low rainfall, respectively. The samples consisted of root segments of approximately 5 cm in length. Five samples were collected at different heights from the ground in aerial roots. These were the upper aerial root (UER) at 10 cm from the node, middle aerial root (MER) at mid-height, lower aerial root (LER) at 10 cm above the ground, main underground root (UMR), and secondary underground root (USR). The whole organ was collected for AR. Fifteen individuals were sampled at each locality. Root segments were preserved in 70° ethanol. For anatomical observation, freehand transverse sections were made with a microtome equipped with a razor blade yielding 20 µm thick sections, and then stained with carmine green (Mirande, 1920). Five anatomical sections were prepared for each of the 15 individuals sampled per site, resulting in 75 anatomical sections per site and 600 anatomical sections for the eight sites studied. Anatomical comparisons of the root sections from different locations were conducted using 30 anatomical sections of the MER per site. The sections were observed under an Olympus BX 43 light field microscope. The images were captured using a Canon EOS 5D Mark I camera. Morphometric evaluation of the organs was performed using ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012), an image processing and analysis software package. The following anatomical characteristics of the roots were recorded: organ, stele, pith, metaxylem, and phloem diameter. The thickness of the epidermis, thickness of the cortex, number and diameter of the aerenchyma, and the number of vascular bundles were also recorded.

这些数据采集于2015年，包含无叶香荚兰植物的生态信息，以及在本研究项目过程中从不同调查点收集的根部解剖数据。在植被均质区（Braun-Blanquet, 1932）设立50×20米样地，该区域存在香荚兰属藤本植物。根据植被斑块大小，样地数量为2至3个不等。每个样地划分为10个10×10米样方。记录每个样方内香荚兰属（藤本及分枝）的数量，测量香荚兰植株总长度。统计每株植株的附着根（AR）与气生根（ER）数量，并记录AR形态（扁平状或丝状）。记录附主植物形态特征，包括高度、树皮质地（光滑或粗糙）、密度及胸高直径（DBH，地面以上1.30米处测量）。树皮皱褶度通过目视和触觉评估。. . 我们对比了北部多雨区和南部少雨区香荚兰属植物的根部解剖结构。样本为长约5厘米的根段。气生根按不同离地高度采集五组样本：距节10厘米的上部气生根（UER）、中部气生根（MER）、离地10厘米的下部气生根（LER）、主地下根（UMR）和次地下根（USR）。附着根采集完整器官。每个地点采样15株个体，根段保存于70°乙醇中。. . 解剖观察采用剃刀式切片机徒手制作20微米厚横切面，经卡红绿染色（Mirande, 1920）。每个地点15株个体各制备5张切片，单地点75张切片，八个研究点共计600张切片。采用各地点的30张MER切片进行区域间解剖结构对比。切片在奥林巴斯BX43明场显微镜下观察，图像通过佳能EOS 5D Mark I相机采集。器官形态计量使用图像处理软件ImageJ（Schneider等，2012）完成，记录以下根部解剖特征：器官、中柱、髓部、后生木质部与韧皮部直径；表皮厚度、皮层厚度、通气组织数量与直径，以及维管束数量。
