Sub-aperture polishing is a key technique for fabricating ultra-precision optics. However, the existence of the polishing errors that are difficult to be compensated by physical modelling seriously affects the manufacturing accuracy and efficiency of optical components. To address this problem, a data-based systematic error extraction and compensation (DSEC) method was proposed to enhance the polishing accuracy on optics. To maximize the extraction quality in small dataset condition, the wavelet transform is introduced into the extraction process, and the uncertainty of piston term in interferometer measurement is improved by L1-norm optimization. Furthermore, two typical error sources (loss of polishing fluid in the edge and the robot trajectory error) is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, in experimental verification, the root mean square(RMS) of the surface figure of a ϕ85-mm mirror was decreased from 0.069λ to 0.017λ and the RMS of the 610×440 mm mirrors was achieved to 0.019λ after the edge compensation, where the polishing accuracy can be improved by more than 4 times; additionally, the RMS of the surface figure with an effective aperture of 480 × 360 mm mirror was reached to 0.011λ after trajectory error compensation, where the polishing accuracy can be improved by more than 2 times. The proposed DSEC model offers insights that will help achieve advancement in the sub-aperture polishing process.

子孔径抛光是制造超精密光学器件的关键技术。然而，难以通过物理建模补偿的抛光误差的存在严重影响了光学元件的制造精度和效率。针对这一问题，本文提出了一种基于数据的系统误差提取与补偿（DSEC）方法以提高光学元件抛光精度。为在小样本条件下最大化提取质量，研究将小波变换引入误差提取过程，并通过L1范数优化改善了干涉仪测量中平移项的不确定性。此外，通过两种典型误差源（边缘区域抛光液缺失和机器人轨迹误差）验证了所提方法的有效性：实验验证中，Φ85毫米镜面面形均方根值从0.069λ降至0.017λ，610×440毫米镜面经边缘补偿后均方根值达0.019λ，抛光精度提升4倍以上；480×360毫米有效口径镜面经轨迹误差补偿后均方根值达0.011λ，抛光精度提升2倍以上。所提出的DSEC模型为实现子孔径抛光工艺的进步提供了重要启示。
