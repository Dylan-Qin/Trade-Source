Forty C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into five groups (n=8 in each group). Healthy control (HC), DSS group (DSS), oral inoculation ATCC12230-US1 group (OR-1), and oral inoculation ATCC25586 group (OR-2). Eight transgenic mice (CDH1KO group) were also incorporated into the study. Mice in HC were free access to food and water. Mice in DSS, OR-1, OR-2, and CDH1KO were consecutively given a 2.5% concentration of DSS solution drink for 14 days.

将40只C57BL/6J小鼠随机分为五组（每组8只），分别为健康对照组（HC）、DSS组（DSS）、口服接种ATCC12230-US1组（OR-1）和口服接种ATCC25586组（OR-2）。另有8只转基因小鼠（CDH1KO组）纳入研究。HC组小鼠自由进食饮水，DSS组、OR-1组、OR-2组及CDH1KO组小鼠连续14天饮用2.5%浓度的DSS溶液。
