This method can provide alpha counts at different time intervals as required by both methods. The automatic measurement process using an alpha spectrometer was realized by writing JOB files in MAESTRO software, which can display and store real-time measurement data. Measurement data by the alpha spectrometer was listed in the Table.

该方法可根据两种方法的要求，提供不同时间间隔的α计数。通过编写MAESTRO软件中的JOB文件实现了α谱仪的自动测量过程，该过程能够显示并存储实时测量数据。α谱仪的测量数据列于表中。
