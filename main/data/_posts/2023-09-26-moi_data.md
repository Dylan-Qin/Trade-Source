The MOI SI155 demodulation instrument was used to measure the central wavelength. The resolution of the demodulation instrument was 0.1 pm, the accuracy was 1 pm, and the sampling frequency was 1000HZ. The demodulation instrument had four parallel optical channels and the wavelength range of demodulation was 1460-1620nm. By measuring the central wavelength of each FBG, the corresponding data of central wavelength under different curvature conditions are obtained. By applying force to the experimental surface, the central wavelength data is obtained and sorted out.

采用MOI SI155解调仪测量中心波长，该解调仪分辨率为0.1 pm，精度为1 pm，采样频率为1000HZ，具有四个并行光通道，解调波长范围为1460-1620nm。通过测量各FBG的中心波长，获得不同曲率条件下中心波长的对应数据。对实验表面施加作用力后，获取并整理中心波长数据。
