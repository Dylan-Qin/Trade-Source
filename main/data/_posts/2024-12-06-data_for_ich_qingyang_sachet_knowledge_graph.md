This dataset includes textual and image data related to the Qianyang sachets, as well as annotated data used for constructing the Qianyang sachet knowledge graph. For physical documents, optical character recognition (OCR) technology was first used to digitize the images and convert them into textual data. The PP-Chat OCRv3, developed by Baidu PaddlePaddle, was employed to extract text from images. This tool combines large-scale language models (LLMs) and OCR technology, and is specifically trained with language-specific data for Chinese text to improve recognition accuracy. After recognition, the textual data were stored in a database. The data was then preprocessed to reduce noise and interference, enhancing the contrast and overall quality of the images. Data cleaning involved deduplication, standardizing format differences (e.g., date formats), and filtering out irrelevant records according to predefined criteria. For errors encountered during preprocessing, the OCR software's built-in text correction function was used to assist in manual correction, ensuring higher accuracy of the foundational data. Finally, manual extraction of data related to the patterns, types, and content of Qianyang sachets was conducted and saved in a two-dimensional table format. Encyclopedic and official website resources were directly gathered through web scraping, followed by cleaning and storage.In addition to textual data, a field survey was conducted in Qianyang City, Gansu Province, from May 2023 to June 2024. During this period, we visited the seven counties and one district of Qianyang and used professional equipment to capture original images of the sachets. In the image preprocessing stage, we manually filtered out low-quality images based on the completeness and clarity of the patterns. Photoshop software was then used to extract individual pattern samples from the original images, with the pattern boundaries serving as the cropping area.

该数据集包含与庆阳香包相关的文本和图像数据，以及用于构建庆阳香包知识图谱的标注数据。针对实体文献资料，首先采用光学字符识别（OCR）技术对图像进行数字化处理并转化为文本数据。使用百度飞桨开发的PP-Chat OCRv3工具进行图像文字提取，该工具结合大语言模型（LLMs）与OCR技术，并专门针对中文文本进行了语言数据的训练以提高识别准确率。识别后的文本数据存入数据库，随后对数据进行预处理以降低噪声干扰，提升图像对比度和整体质量。数据清洗工作包括去重、标准化格式差异（如日期格式）、按预设条件筛选无关记录等。针对预处理过程中发现的错误，借助OCR软件内置的文本修正功能辅助人工校正，确保基础数据具有更高准确性。最后人工提取庆阳香包纹样、类型、内涵等相关数据，以二维表格形式保存。百科类与官网资源通过爬虫直接采集，经清洗后存储。除文本数据外，我们于2023年5月至2024年6月期间在甘肃省庆阳市开展实地调研，走访庆阳七县一区，使用专业设备拍摄香包实物原图。在图像预处理阶段，我们根据纹样完整度与清晰度人工筛选剔除低质量图像，随后使用Photoshop软件从原图中提取单个纹样样本，以纹样边界作为裁剪区域。
