16S rRNA sequencing was used to detect intestinal flora. Paired end-PE (PE) reads obtained by Hiseq/Miseq sequencing were splitted into a sequence, and the target sequence was quality-controlled and filtered. The filtered sequences were compared with the reference database, and the chimeric sequences were removed to obtain the final optimized sequence.

采用16S rRNA测序技术检测肠道菌群。通过Hiseq/Miseq测序获得的双端（PE）读段被拆分为单条序列，并对目标序列进行质控过滤。将过滤后的序列与参考数据库比对，去除嵌合体序列后获得最终优化序列。
