The raw data is acquired during the shot #80675 on Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak by the Data Acquisition and Control System of Microwave Reflectometry. There are 8 signals including: I and Q signals from Q-band, V-band and W-band; sweep frequency control voltage from Q-band and V-band.

原始数据由微波反射仪数据采集与控制系统在实验先进超导托卡马克装置第80675次放电时获取，包含8个信号：Q波段、V波段和W波段的I信号与Q信号；Q波段与V波段的扫频控制电压。
