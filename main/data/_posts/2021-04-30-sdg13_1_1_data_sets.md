The Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations aim to solve social, economic and environmental development problems in an integrated manner during the period from 2015 to 2030. The 13th SDG is to “Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”, concerning sub-goal 13.1 “Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate related hazards and disasters in all countries”. SDG13.1.1 has been defined to be a specific, effective indicator that can be used to quantitatively monitor and evaluate governments' response to climate change. It is defined as the “number of deaths, missing persons and directly affected persons attributed to disasters per 100,000 population”. The EM-DAT contains important core data on the occurrence and impact of more than 220,000 large-scale disasters worldwide from 1900 to the present. As a global disaster database, the EM-DAT provides a large amount of natural and technological disaster data for international projects and scientific research. By making use of the EM-DAT big data and SGD13.1.1 indicators, it is possible to quantify disaster information at a large geographical scale and to conduct valuable disaster assessments of different countries and regions, as well as to improve the monitoring and assessment of disaster risk reduction capabilities, and strengthen the ability of countries to adapt to, resist, and reduce extreme disasters caused by climate change. In our related paper "Disaster Assessment for the “Belt and Road” Region based on SDG landmarks", disaster assessment for the ‘Belt and Road’ region was carried out in relation to the SGD13.1.1 indicator, based on the EM-DAT (The Emergency Events Database) database. A new method for diagnosing trends in SGD13.1.1 was proposed, and an overview of disaster records is used to quantify disasters for a total of 73 countries using the data available in the EM-DAT. The following data are supplementary materials for this article,including:the calculation variables of the SDG13.1.1 indicator;disaster types of each country in the whole Belt and Road region; calulated SDG13.1.1 value and trend values of each country in the Belt and Road countries.

联合国制定的可持续发展目标旨在2015至2030年间综合解决社会、经济和环境发展问题。其中第13项目标是"采取紧急行动应对气候变化及其影响"，具体涉及子目标13.1"加强各国抵御和适应气候相关灾害的能力"。SDG13.1.1被定义为可量化监测评估政府应对气候变化成效的具体指标，其内容为"每10万人中因灾害致死的失踪及直接受影响人数"。EM-DAT数据库收录了1900年至今全球超过22万起重大灾害事件的核心数据，作为国际灾害数据库为各类国际项目和科研提供大量自然与技术灾害数据。利用EM-DAT大数据和SGD13.1.1指标，可在宏观地理尺度量化灾害信息，对"一带一路"沿线国家开展有价值的灾害评估，同时提升减灾能力监测评估水平，增强各国适应、抵御和降低气候变化所致极端灾害的能力。我们在关联论文《基于SDG标志物的"一带一路"区域灾害评估》中，依托EM-DAT应急事件数据库，围绕SGD13.1.1指标对"一带一路"区域开展灾害评估，提出SGD13.1.1趋势诊断新方法，利用现有数据对73个国家的灾害记录进行量化分析。以下数据为本研究的补充材料，包括：SDG13.1.1指标计算变量、"一带一路"沿线各国灾害类型分类，以及各国SDG13.1.1指标计算结果与趋势值。
