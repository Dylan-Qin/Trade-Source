A data acquisition system is designed, which is a pre-research system for the data acquisition system of an orbitrap mass spectrometer.The data set is mainly the test results obtained by the designed acquisition system through the use of signal generator and the test system. It doesn't matter where or when.

设计了一套数据采集系统，这是为轨道阱质谱仪数据采集系统所做的预研系统。数据集主要是所设计的采集系统通过信号发生器和测试系统获得的测试结果。地点和时间无关紧要。
