Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are important for the transport of biologically active materials and function in intercellular communication. Amphibian skin is an exposed mucosa that participates in many important physiological processes. However, little is known about EVs in amphibian skin. Here, using the toad Bombina maxima as the research model, we successfully isolated EVs from skin secretions. These EVs, were characterized using nanoparticle tracking analysis, western blotting and electron microscopy. Proteomic analysis by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry identified 131 proteins in skin secretion-derived EVs, enriched in proteins related to immune stress, metabolism, oxidoreduction and transport based on their biological processes or molecular functions. The proteins in non-EVs (the proteins in Bombina maxima skin secretions that excepted EV) skin secretions were also analyzed, and 313 proteins were identified in these samples. Comparison of EV and non-EV proteins revealed that 62 proteins were unique to EVs, 244 proteins were unique to non-EVs, and 69 proteins were shared between EVs and non-EV secretions. Flow cytometry assay revealed that the isolated EVs could be taken up by B. maxima skin derived fibroblast cells. These findings provide the first evidence that EVs containing biologically active molecules are secreted from amphibian skin and can be taken up by amphibian skin cells, suggesting that EVs play important physiological roles in amphibian skin.

细胞外囊泡（EVs）在生物活性物质的运输和细胞间通讯中发挥重要作用。两栖动物皮肤是一种暴露的黏膜组织，参与众多重要生理过程。然而，目前对两栖动物皮肤中EVs的认知仍十分有限。本研究以大蹼铃蟾为模型，成功从其皮肤分泌物中分离出EVs，并通过纳米颗粒追踪分析、蛋白质印迹和电子显微镜技术对其进行了表征。采用液相色谱-串联质谱法进行的蛋白质组学分析鉴定出131种皮肤分泌物来源EVs中的蛋白质，根据其生物过程或分子功能分类，这些蛋白质主要富集于免疫应激、代谢、氧化还原和运输等相关通路。同时分析了非EV组分（大蹼铃蟾皮肤分泌物中除EV外的蛋白质），鉴定出313种蛋白质。EV与非EV蛋白质的比较显示：62种蛋白质为EV特有，244种为非EV特有，69种为两者共有。流式细胞术检测表明，分离的EVs可被大蹼铃蟾皮肤源成纤维细胞摄取。这些发现首次证实两栖动物皮肤能分泌含有生物活性分子的EVs，且这些EVs可被皮肤细胞吸收，提示EVs在两栖动物皮肤中具有重要生理功能。
