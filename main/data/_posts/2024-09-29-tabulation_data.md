The data in this article, "Optimizing Safety Leadership towards Safety Performance: Assessing the Mediating Role of Safety Knowledge and Workplace Safety Climate - Evidence from an Indonesian Petrochemical Industry," is in the form of a Likert scale tabulation. It represents survey responses measuring perceptions of various aspects related to safety leadership, safety performance, safety knowledge, and workplace safety climate. The Likert scale typically ranges from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree," used to assess the strength of respondents' agreement with the statements provided in the questionnaire. This data is then analyzed to identify relationships between variables, such as the mediating role of safety knowledge and workplace safety climate in enhancing safety performance through safety leadership.

本文《优化安全领导力以提升安全绩效：评估安全知识与工作场所安全氛围的中介作用——来自印度尼西亚石化行业的证据》中的数据采用李克特量表形式呈现。该量表通过"非常不同意"至"非常同意"的梯度，测量受访者对安全领导力、安全绩效、安全知识及工作场所安全氛围相关表述的认同程度。研究者通过分析这些量表数据，旨在揭示各变量间的关联机制，例如安全知识与工作场所安全氛围如何在安全领导力促进安全绩效的过程中发挥中介作用。
