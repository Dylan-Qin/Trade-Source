In the carbon market, the research on trade information is conducive to understanding the problems of information disclosure and information transmission in the formation of carbon price. The trading data during 2014 – 2017 of Shanghai, Beijing, Guangdong, Shenzhen, Hubei, Tianjin and Chongqing were collected from the official websites of seven pilot markets. To ensure the continuity of data, all non-trade dates were removed during the data collection process. This dataset contains comprehensive trade information such as daily transaction volume and daily transaction turnover of each pilot market. It can not only serve as data support for relevant researches such as the analysis of the relationship between volume and price and the research on the effectiveness of carbon market, but also provide experience and reference for the construction of the carbon market nationwide.

在碳市场中，对交易信息的研究有助于理解碳价形成过程中的信息披露与信息传递问题。本研究从上海、北京、广东、深圳、湖北、天津和重庆七个试点市场的官方网站收集了2014-2017年的交易数据。为确保数据连续性，在采集过程中剔除了所有非交易日数据。该数据集包含各试点市场日成交量、日成交额等完整交易信息，既能为量价关系分析、碳市场有效性研究等提供数据支撑，也可为全国碳市场建设提供经验借鉴。
