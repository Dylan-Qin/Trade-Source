Introduction: Intra-African Trade has been covered in various studies focusing on all African trade blocks. Trade is critical to the success of many sectors of most developed countries. Intra-African Trade in the EAC has been deemed as a positive contributing factor towards enhancing economic benefits between Uganda and Kenya. Currently the settlement of the sugar pact between Kenya and Uganda aims at improving the regionalism of the two countries in East Africa (EAC) but still there are several disadvantages as there are advantages to the western region millers in Kenya. Though there are several issues that arise in different products within any Intra-African trades to explain the same in relation to the Kenya-Uganda Sugar Pact and its impact on Western Region Sugar Millers in Kenya. This brings up the discussion on whether the sugar pact will positively or negatively affects sugarcane farmers in Kenyan region.Objectives: The objectives of the study were to first assess the impact of the Kenya-Uganda Sugar Pact on small holder sugarcane farmers. To secondly identify the impact of the Kenya-Uganda Sugar Pact on socio-economic development. Thirdly to examine the impact of the Kenya-Uganda Sugar Pact on sugar companies. Fourthly to determine interventions and alternatives to address challenges brought about by the Kenya-Uganda Sugar pact in Western Region in Kenya.Study Design: A case study research design.Study Area: Nzoia Sugar Company in Western Region in Kenya.Data Collection Tools and Procedures: Interview guides and questionnaire were used to collect data.Data Analysis: Qualitative and quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics included percentage tables. The study findings were interpreted to show the perception of the respondent on issues raised in the questionnaires to answer the research questions.Results: 41 percent of respondents stated smallholder farmers will lack protection to ensure food security and decent earnings from their produce. 53 percent gave the opinion that it will lead to slow growth due to slow rate of pay on time done by sugar cane suppliers. Another 41 percent agreed that the companies will suffer from recovery especially if sugar produced is not excessively sold and thus leading to companies shutting down. Finally, 51 percent were of the opinion that the government needs to regulate the amount of sugar imported to Kenya in the sugar pact between Kenya and Uganda.

引言：关于非洲内部贸易的各类研究已覆盖所有非洲贸易区块。贸易对多数发达国家众多领域的成功至关重要。东非共同体（EAC）框架下的非洲内部贸易被视为增强乌干达与肯尼亚经济互利的积极因素。当前肯尼亚与乌干达达成的食糖协议旨在提升两国在东非地区的区域一体化，但对肯尼亚西部地区的糖厂而言，其优势与劣势并存。尽管非洲内部贸易中不同商品会引发诸多问题，本研究将聚焦肯乌食糖协议及其对肯尼亚西部地区糖厂的影响，由此引发关于该协议对肯尼亚蔗农影响的利弊讨论。. . 研究目标：本研究首先评估肯乌食糖协议对小规模蔗农的影响；其次识别该协议对社会经济发展的影响；再次考察其对糖业公司的影响；最后提出应对肯尼亚西部地区因该协议所面临挑战的干预措施与替代方案。. . 研究设计：采用案例研究设计。. . 研究区域：肯尼亚西部地区的恩佐亚糖业公司。. . 数据收集工具与方法：运用访谈提纲与问卷调查收集数据。. . 数据分析：通过描述性统计（含百分比表格）分析定性与定量数据，研究结果用于阐释受访者对问卷所提问题的看法以解答研究问题。. . 研究结果：41%受访者认为小农户将缺乏保障机制以确保粮食安全与作物合理收益；53%指出因甘蔗供应商付款延迟将导致增长放缓；另有41%认同糖企将面临经营困难——若食糖滞销甚至会导致企业倒闭；最终51%受访者主张政府需调控肯乌食糖协议中的进口糖数量。
