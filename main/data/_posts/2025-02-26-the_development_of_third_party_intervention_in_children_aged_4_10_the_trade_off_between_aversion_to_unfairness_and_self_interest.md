As children grow, they learn to understand and navigate fairness norms and may intervene in unfair situations at a personal cost, either by punishing the wrongdoer or helping the victim. This study examines how children (N = 196, ages 4–10) balance fairness and self-interest when making costly third-party interventions. Using a third-party trust game, children made decisions in both punishment and helping contexts across three levels of unfairness. Results revealed that younger children, in low unfairness conditions, displayed more intervention behaviors than older children, often going beyond what was required to restore fairness. In contrast, older children’s interventions were more aligned with the fairness needs of the situation. Age influenced the proportion of children displaying fairness-oriented or self-interest-oriented behaviors, especially in punishment contexts, with younger children showing more unclear decision-making. Negative empathy was found to predict fairness-oriented decisions in punishment situations, with children exhibiting higher negative empathy more likely to choose fairness. The relationship between empathy and third-party helping behavior was less clear, as helping behavior both reflects fairness and compensates the victim altruistically. These findings suggest that as children age, they become more discerning in balancing fairness and self-interest, and that empathy plays a key role in shaping their third-party intervention decisions, especially in punitive contexts.

随着儿童的成长，他们学会理解并运用公平规范，甚至可能不惜个人代价干预不公平现象，包括惩罚违规者或帮助受害者。本研究探讨了196名4至10岁儿童在进行需要付出代价的第三方干预时，如何平衡公平与自利。通过第三方信任游戏，孩子们在惩罚和帮助两种情境下针对三种不公平程度做出决策。结果显示，在轻微不公平条件下，低龄儿童比年长儿童表现出更多干预行为，其程度常超出恢复公平所需；而年长儿童的干预行为与情境的公平需求更为匹配。年龄因素显著影响儿童选择公平导向或自利导向行为的比例，尤其在惩罚情境中，低龄儿童表现出更模糊的决策倾向。研究发现负向共情能预测惩罚情境中的公平导向决策，共情能力越强的儿童越倾向于选择公平。共情与第三方帮助行为的关系较不明确，因帮助行为既体现公平又包含对受害者的利他补偿。这些发现表明，儿童随着年龄增长会更精准地权衡公平与自利，共情（尤其在惩罚情境中）对其第三方干预决策具有关键影响。
