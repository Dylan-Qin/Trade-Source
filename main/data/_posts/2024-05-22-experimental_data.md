The research improves the mechanical properties of laminates in ship hulls made of glass fiber reinforced plastics (GFRP) with the design of auxetic sheets, to take advantage of the property in their geometry of reducing the damage energy due to surface impacts absorbed by the laminate. Using 3D printing of the second generation auxetic component for the production of modified specimens. Laboratory reproductions of mechanical damage are compared with specimens extracted from a ship under construction. It is obtained that the mechanical properties of Bending and traction allow us to demonstrate that the insertion of the core in the laminate protects the matrix from damage energy, prolonging its useful life. Comparative results are presented which will allow GFRP hull designers to insert auxetic sheet cores into their designs. The mechanical tests carried out allow us to compare how the delamination’s progress while.

该研究通过设计拉胀板材，提升了玻璃纤维增强塑料（GFRP）船体层压板的机械性能，以利用其几何特性减少层压板吸收表面冲击造成的损伤能量。采用第二代拉胀元件的3D打印技术制作改良试件，将实验室模拟的机械损伤与在建船舶提取的试件进行对比。结果表明：弯曲和拉伸机械性能证实层压板中嵌入芯材能保护基体免受损伤能量影响，从而延长使用寿命。研究提供的对比数据将为GFRP船体设计师在设计中引入拉胀板芯材提供依据。通过机械测试可同步观察分层现象的扩展进程。
