This compressed file provides the spectral data for the manuscript titled "Pulse-shaping method for real-time neutron/gamma discrimination at low sampling rates". The compressed file consists of multiple folders, each of which is described as follows:(1) A tested gamma spectrum of Am-241.(2) Waveforms containing several pulses captured with an integrated logic analyzer from the Vivado.(3) Two folders containing gamma and neutron digital signals and shaped signals. These signals were also captured with an integrated logic analyzer from the Vivado.(4) PSD plots measured at different sampling rates. They were uploaded from the discriminator through the serial port and can be opened with Notepad.(5) Response spectrum of mixed neutron and gamma signals and neutron response spectrum.

该压缩文件提供了题为《低采样率下实时中子/伽马甄别的脉冲整形方法》论文的光谱数据。压缩文件包含多个文件夹，具体说明如下：(1) 一个已测试的Am-241伽马能谱。(2) 通过Vivado集成逻辑分析仪捕获的含多个脉冲的波形文件。(3) 两个分别存储伽马与中子数字信号及整形信号的文件夹，这些信号同样由Vivado集成逻辑分析仪捕获。(4) 不同采样率下测量的PSD图谱，通过串口从甄别器上传，可用记事本打开。(5) 中子伽马混合信号响应谱及中子响应谱。
