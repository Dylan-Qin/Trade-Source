Electron rapping materials, due to their exceptional ability of energy storage and controllable photo release under external stimulation, have attracted coherent attention in the field of optical information storage (OIS) In this work, Gd3Al3Ga2O12: Ce3+, Yb3+fluorescence ceramics, were developed using air and vacuum sintering technology By co copying Ce3+and Yb3+, the trap density was significantly increased by 7.5 times compared to samples containing only Ce3+ Vacuum annexing further enhanced trap density by 1.6 times compared to samples alone in air, while generating deep traps (1.44 eV), making Gd3Al3Ga2O12: Ce3+, Yb3+an excellent OIS medium This work is expected to facilitate the development of OIS materials

电子俘获材料因其卓越的能量存储能力和在外界刺激下可控的光释放特性，在光信息存储（OIS）领域引起了持续关注。本研究采用空气与真空烧结技术制备了Gd3Al3Ga2O12: Ce3+, Yb3+荧光陶瓷。通过Ce3+与Yb3+的共掺杂，样品陷阱密度较单一Ce3+掺杂样品显著提升7.5倍。真空烧结相较于空气烧结样品进一步将陷阱密度提高1.6倍，同时产生深能级陷阱（1.44 eV），使Gd3Al3Ga2O12: Ce3+, Yb3+成为优异的OIS介质。该工作有望推动OIS材料的发展。
