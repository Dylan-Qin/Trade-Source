This dataset includes transcriptome data of tea plants from a tea plantation in Hunan Province. The aim of this study was to investigate the gene expression patterns of tea plants following insect damage. The data is stored in FASTQ format, with ZLH files representing samples unaffected by insects and ZLI files representing samples affected by insects. This dataset provides a comprehensive view of gene expression in tea plants after exposure to insect feeding, aiding in the understanding of the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying the plant's growth-defense trade-off.

该数据集包含湖南省某茶园的茶树转录组数据。本研究旨在探究茶树遭受虫害后的基因表达模式。数据以FASTQ格式存储，其中ZLH文件代表未受虫害影响的样本，ZLI文件代表受虫害影响的样本。该数据集全面呈现了茶树遭受昆虫取食后的基因表达情况，有助于理解植物生长与防御平衡背后的基因调控机制。
