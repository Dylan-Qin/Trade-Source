This database includes data from a behavioral experiment which aimed to investigate the effect of training on self-prioritization effect (SPE). 36 participants were recruited from Tsinghua University and nearby community, all of whom were right-handed and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Participants were pre-tested for their depressive level by Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Only participants with score lower than 10 (n=30) and those higher than 20 (n=6, ID: 6005, 6006, 6010, 6022, 6025, and 6036) were included. The experiment was approved by the IRB at the Department of Psychology, Tsinghua University, and all participants provided informed consent. The experiment has two behavioral tasks, both required participants to associate different stimuli with self, other, emotions, and rewards. The stimuli were presented, and response data were collected by E-Prime 2.0. The whole experiment costed approximately 80 minutes. The database includes data on participants' responses. Data from three participants (ID: 6008, 6015, and 6031) should be excluded due to invalid trials or program malfunctions. Please see “README.md” for more details about the experimental design, procedure, and tasks.

该数据库包含一项行为实验的数据，旨在研究训练对自我优先效应（SPE）的影响。实验从清华大学及周边社区招募了36名参与者，均为右利手且视力正常或矫正至正常。通过贝克抑郁量表（BDI）对参与者的抑郁水平进行预测试，仅纳入得分低于10分的参与者（n=30）和高于20分的参与者（n=6，编号：6005、6006、6010、6022、6025和6036）。实验经清华大学心理学系伦理委员会批准，所有参与者均签署知情同意书。实验包含两项行为任务，均要求参与者将不同刺激与自我、他人、情绪及奖励相关联。刺激呈现及反应数据通过E-Prime 2.0采集，整个实验耗时约80分钟。数据库包含参与者的反应数据，其中三名参与者（编号：6008、6015和6031）因无效试次或程序故障需排除。实验设计、流程及任务详情请参阅"README.md"文件。
