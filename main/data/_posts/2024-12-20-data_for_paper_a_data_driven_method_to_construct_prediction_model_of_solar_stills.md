The interdisciplinary field between solar desalination and machine learning is the subject of a cutting-edge study. Generally, the studies treated data acquisition and model construction as independent processes, leading to problems such as insufficient dataset size or resource wastage. This study proposes a data-driven method that integrates data acquisition with model construction processes. By using the Bayesian optimization algorithm, the method accelerates the convergence of model accuracy. By comparing the results of 100 pairs of simulations, it is found that the models using the data-driven method are more accurate than traditional expert-driven methods in 70% of compared results. Additionally, when it makes a model with the mean absolute percentage error as 5%, the proposed data-driven method requires 220 additional data on average, compared to 258 with the traditional expert-driven method, representing a 14.7% reduction. This work offers new ways and a broad application of the interdiscipline between solar desalination and machine learning.

太阳能海水淡化与机器学习交叉领域成为一项前沿研究的主题。以往研究通常将数据采集与模型构建视为独立流程，导致数据集规模不足或资源浪费等问题。本研究提出一种将数据采集与模型构建相融合的数据驱动方法，通过贝叶斯优化算法加速模型精度的收敛速度。经100组模拟结果对比发现，采用数据驱动方法构建的模型在70%的对比结果中精度优于传统专家驱动方法。当构建平均绝对百分比误差为5%的模型时，所提数据驱动方法平均需追加220组数据，较传统专家驱动方法的258组减少了14.7%。该工作为太阳能海水淡化与机器学习的交叉研究提供了新思路和广阔应用前景。
