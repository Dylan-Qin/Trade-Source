From 2022 to 2023, CdO films were prepared by magnetron sputtering technology, and their nonlinear optical properties were regulated by different concentrations of tungsten doping. TThe nonlinear optical properties in mid-infrared band were analyzed by Z-scan and pump detection techniques. The damage threshold was measured by 800nm femtosecond laser. A 2μm solid-state Q-switched laser based on CdO saturable absorber was constructed, and the pulse laser output with adjustable parameters was obtained. The relevant experimental data are listed in the file.

2022年至2023年期间，采用磁控溅射技术制备了氧化镉薄膜，并通过不同浓度的钨掺杂调控其非线性光学特性。利用Z扫描和泵浦探测技术分析了中红外波段的非线性光学性能，使用800纳米飞秒激光测量了损伤阈值。构建了基于氧化镉可饱和吸收体的2微米固态调Q激光器，获得了参数可调的脉冲激光输出。相关实验数据列于文件中。
