This study examined the impact of cultural context and linguistic distance on bilateral trade, employing a modified version of the gravity model. The analysis utilized trade data from 117 countries, encompassing 6,623 trading pairs. Bilateral trade was estimated as a function of cultural context, linguistic distance, along with other relevant economic and geographic factors. The findings revealed that linguistic distance does not exert a statistically significant impact on bilateral trade; however, the analysis demonstrated that cultural context plays a significant role in shaping bilateral trade patterns. Specifically, belonging to the same cultural context was found to decrease bilateral trade, while increasing cultural context distance between trading countries was observed to promote trade.

本研究采用修正版引力模型，探讨了文化背景与语言距离对双边贸易的影响。分析涵盖117个国家的贸易数据，涉及6,623组贸易伙伴关系。研究将双边贸易量建模为文化背景、语言距离及其他相关经济地理因素的函数。结果显示：语言距离对双边贸易未产生统计学显著影响；而文化背景则对贸易格局具有显著塑造作用。具体而言，属于相同文化背景会抑制双边贸易，而贸易国之间文化背景差异的扩大则能促进贸易往来。
