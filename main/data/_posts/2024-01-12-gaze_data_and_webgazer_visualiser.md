In our research, we took advantage of consumer webcams and open-source software to gather data from a larger group of students, demonstrating high scalability and cost-effectiveness of this approach. We aimed to study the differences in reading behavior between students reading regular text with illustrations and the same text with highlighted important terms. The subjects, first-year university students, filled out a questionnaire and introductory test in order to determine their knowledge level. A total of 80 full-time students were directly involved in the experiment. The students were subsequently randomly divided into two equally sized groups - the experimental group, which was enrolled in a variant of the e-course containing chapters with visually distinguished important terms, and the control group, with the same subchapters but without the highlighted terms. A total of 68 students took part in both measurements; however, only 59 achieved serviceable results from the first measurement and 61 from the second one. The data was analyzed both qualitatively using visualizations and quantitatively using statistical measures on the data and test results. We haven’t observed a significant difference between the experimental and control group in neither the gaze patterns, not their test results. We did however find a significant gaze pattern differences between the higher scoring students and the failing students.The first takeaway is the feasibility to conduct larger scale eye-tracking experiments. Most of the studies in this area use very small population samples due to the time and financial constraints of the methods using specialized eye-tracking hardware. Our method is scalable, as it relies on low-end hardware and outsources the recording to the students’ devices. The second takeaway is that although eye-tracking may not be useful to fine-tune text already optimized for readability, it may be a useful tool to identify and help struggling learners.

在我们的研究中，我们利用消费者级网络摄像头和开源软件从更广泛的学生群体中收集数据，证明了该方法的高度可扩展性和成本效益。我们旨在研究学生在阅读带插图的常规文本与标注重点术语的相同文本时的行为差异。实验对象为大学一年级学生，他们填写了问卷和入门测试以确定知识水平。共有80名全日制学生直接参与实验，随后被随机分为人数相等的两组——实验组学习包含视觉突出显示重点术语章节的电子课程变体，对照组学习相同子章节但无标注术语。共有68名学生参与两次测量，但第一次测量仅59人获得有效结果，第二次为61人。数据通过可视化进行定性分析，并基于数据和测试结果采用统计方法进行定量分析。我们未发现实验组与对照组在注视模式或测试结果上存在显著差异，但确实观察到高分学生与不及格学生之间存在显著的注视模式差异。首要启示是开展大规模眼动追踪实验的可行性。该领域多数研究因专业眼动仪设备的时间和资金限制而样本量极小。我们的方法依赖低端硬件并将录制环节交由学生设备完成，具有可扩展性。次要启示是，虽然眼动追踪可能无助于微调已优化可读性的文本，但可作为识别和帮助学习困难者的有效工具。
