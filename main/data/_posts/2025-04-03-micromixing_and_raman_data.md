Magnetically agitated miniaturised continuous stirred tank reactors (m-CSTRs) are an attractive tool for the investigation of reaction kinetics, as they combine active stirring with enhanced heat and mass transfer due to their small dimensions, while their compatibility with in-situ spectroscopic techniques enables real-time reaction monitoring and high-throughput data acquisition. This study presents the development of a 2.65 ml m-CSTR, integrated with in situ Raman spectroscopy for real-time kinetic data acquisition in continuous flow systems through steady-state experimentation. The reactor, featuring a temperature-controlled stainless-steel chamber with a top quartz glass window and a PTFE slotted impeller, was assessed for its macro- and micro-mixing characteristics at flowrates between 0.5 and 4 mL/min. The slotted impeller led to near-ideal CSTR behaviour and improved micromixing quality in comparison to conventional cross stir bars of similar dimensions. Using the imine synthesis of n-benzylidenebenzylamine from benzaldehyde and benzylamine as a model reaction with direct composition measurement inside the reactor, kinetic parameters were determined and the most informative design space was identified to be in the region of high reactant concentrations, short residence times (i.e., high flowrate) and lower temperatures.  Raw data describing micromixing (micromixing time and segregation index) and average concentrations of benzaldehyde and benzylamine for kinetic experiments obtained using Raman spectroscopy.

磁力搅拌微型连续搅拌釜反应器（m-CSTR）因其结合了主动搅拌与小尺寸带来的强化传热传质特性，成为研究反应动力学的理想工具，同时其与原位光谱技术的兼容性实现了实时反应监测与高通量数据采集。本研究开发了一种2.65毫升m-CSTR系统，通过稳态实验与拉曼光谱联用，实现了连续流动体系中实时动力学数据的采集。该反应器采用带顶部石英玻璃窗的温控不锈钢腔体及聚四氟乙烯开槽叶轮，在0.5至4毫升/分钟流速范围内评估了其宏观与微观混合特性。相较于同尺寸传统十字搅拌子，开槽叶轮展现出接近理想的CSTR行为并提升了微观混合质量。以苯甲醛与苄胺合成N-苄亚甲基苄胺的亚胺反应为模型，通过反应器内直接组分测量，确定了动力学参数，发现最具信息量的设计空间位于高反应物浓度、短停留时间（即高流速）及较低温度区域。实验获得的原始数据包括拉曼光谱测定的微观混合参数（微观混合时间与离析指数）以及动力学实验中苯甲醛与苄胺的平均浓度。
