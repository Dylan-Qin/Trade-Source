MassTeach was designed to increase and diversify the statewide STEM teacher workforce by orchestrating initiatives between the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education and faculty across the Commonwealth’s community college and state university system. Recognizing that community colleges represent the diversity of their surrounding communities but acknowledging that these students are underrepresented in the STEM education pipeline, MassTeach aimed to enhance the relationships across the state with a student-focused lens, and provide scholarship and additional program supports to reinforce a clear 2-to-4 year pathway to teaching licensure in a STEM field. The supports buffered inflection points that were highlighted by ten years of statewide higher education enrollment data that represented hundreds of thousands of students and were further resolved by five years of MassTeach data representing twenty-eight individual Scholars. Although a combination of MassTeach and other leveraged resources helped facilitate a smooth 2-to-4 year transition, a single intervention, such as scholarship funding, did not eliminate barriers to participation due to the variety of challenges students faced, especially when compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. The coordinated efforts of MassTeach highlighted the importance of intentional efforts to engage with all students and flexibility to respond to their ongoing needs and pursuit of their career goals.

MassTeach旨在通过协调马萨诸塞州高等教育部门与全州社区学院及州立大学系统教职员工的合作，增加并多元化全州STEM教师队伍。该项目认识到社区学院反映了周边社区的多样性，但也意识到这些学生在STEM教育渠道中代表性不足，因此致力于以学生为中心加强全州范围内的联系，并提供奖学金及其他项目支持，以强化从两年制到四年制院校获取STEM领域教学执照的清晰路径。这些支持措施缓解了由十年全州高等教育入学数据（涵盖数十万学生）凸显的关键转折点，并通过五年MassTeach项目数据（涉及二十八位学者）进一步验证。尽管MassTeach与其他整合资源共同促进了两年制到四年制的平稳过渡，但单一干预措施（如奖学金资助）并未消除学生面临的参与障碍，尤其是当这些挑战与COVID-19疫情叠加时。MassTeach的协同努力凸显了有意识地接触所有学生、灵活响应其持续需求和职业目标追求的重要性。
