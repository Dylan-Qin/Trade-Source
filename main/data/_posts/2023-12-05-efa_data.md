2.1. Coating preparation The TBC system consisted of one 150-μm-thick NiCoCrAlTaY bondcoat deposited by vacuum plasma spraying (VPS, Oerlikon Metco, Wohlen, Switzerland), and one 8YSZ top-coat deposited by an atmospheric plasma spraying (APS, Oerlikon Metco, Wohlen, Switzerland) using an F4MB-XL plasma gun. Ni-based superalloy plates (GH3128, Beijing CISRI-GAONA Materials & Technology Co., Ltd., China) with a dimension of 25 mm × 25 mm × 2.7 mm were selected as substrates. The chemical composition and size distribution of powder for bondcoat and top-coat (P1, P2, P3) were displayed in Table 1. The as-sprayed coatings (N1, N2, N3 and N4) with a thickness of approximately 900 μm, 950 μm, 1000 μm, and 950 μm. N1 and N2 TTBCs were prepared by two kinds of powder (P1 and P3, P1 and P2), successively. P1 and P2 powder was corresponding to N3 and N4 coating, respectively. Detailed spraying parameters were given in Table 2. The microstructure and XRD patterns of the powder were shown in the Fig. 1. 2.2. Thermal shock test The thermal shock tests were performed in the tube furnace (SLG 1400–50, Shanghai Shengli Test Instrument Co., Ltd., China) by heating and the water quenching method. The specimens with substrate were heat treated at the temperature of 1100 ◦C for 30 min and then put into the cold deionized water quickly, followed by compressed air drying and a macroscopical observation. When a visible  delaminated region reached about 10% of total coated surface, the test was stopped and the number of cycles to spallation was defined as the thermal shock lifetime of each sample. The aim of performing thermal cycling tests was to comprehend the microstructure changes in the TTBCs under abrupt temperature variations. 2.3. Coating characterization Microstructural and composition of the coatings were examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-4800, HITACHI, Tokyo, Japan) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS, SwiftED3000, Oxford Instruments, UK). Metallographic cross sections needed to be prepared for all samples to investigate the failure modes. The phase constituents of as-sprayed coatings and thermal shocked samples were characterized by an X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/max 2550 V, Rigaku Japan) with filtered Cu Ka (40 kV, 40 mA) radiation at a scan rate of 4◦ min− 1 in the 2θ range of 10-90◦. Phase and crystallographic analysis were carried out by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD, NordlysNano, Oxford, UK). The scanning area was approximately 5100 μm2, and the step size was 150 nm. In particular, Ion Milling Device (EM TIC3X, Leica, Germany) was necessary in the preparation process of corresponding samples for EBSD characterization.

2.1. 涂层制备 该热障涂层系统由一层150微米厚的NiCoCrAlTaY粘结层（采用真空等离子喷涂VPS技术，Oerlikon Metco公司，瑞士沃伦）和一层8YSZ面层（采用大气等离子喷涂APS技术，使用F4MB-XL等离子喷枪，Oerlikon Metco公司，瑞士沃伦）组成。选用尺寸为25毫米×25毫米×2.7毫米的镍基高温合金板（GH3128，北京钢研高纳科技股份有限公司）作为基体。粘结层与面层所用粉末（P1、P2、P3）的化学成分及粒径分布见表1。喷涂态涂层（N1、N2、N3和N4）厚度分别约为900微米、950微米、1000微米和950微米。N1和N2热障涂层依次采用两种粉末（P1与P3、P1与P2）制备，P1和P2粉末分别对应N3和N4涂层。具体喷涂参数见表2。粉末的微观结构及XRD图谱如图1所示。. . 2.2. 热震测试 热震测试在管式炉（SLG 1400-50，上海晟皋测试仪器有限公司）中通过加热-水淬法进行。带基体的试样在1100℃下热处理30分钟后迅速浸入去离子冷水中，经压缩空气干燥后进行宏观观察。当可见剥落区域达到涂层总面积的约10%时终止测试，记录剥落时的循环次数作为各样品的热震寿命。开展热循环测试旨在探究热障涂层在温度骤变下的微观结构演变。. . 2.3. 涂层表征 采用扫描电子显微镜（SEM，S-4800，日立，日本东京）结合能谱仪（EDS，SwiftED3000，牛津仪器，英国）分析涂层微观形貌与成分。所有样品均需制备金相截面以研究失效模式。采用X射线衍射仪（XRD，D/max 2550 V，理学，日本）在40kV/40mA的Cu Kα辐射下，以4°/分钟的扫描速率在10-90° 2θ范围内表征喷涂态涂层与热震后样品的物相组成。通过电子背散射衍射（EBSD，NordlysNano，牛津仪器，英国）进行物相与晶体学分析，扫描区域约5100μm²，步长150nm。需特别说明的是，EBSD样品制备过程中需使用离子研磨仪（EM TIC3X，徕卡，德国）。
