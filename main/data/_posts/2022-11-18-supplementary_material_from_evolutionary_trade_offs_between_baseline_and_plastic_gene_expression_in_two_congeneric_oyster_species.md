Organismal responses to environmental stresses are a determinant of the effect of climate change. These can occur through the regulation of gene expression, involving genetic adaptation and plastic changes as evolutionary strategy. Heat shock protein (hsp) family genes are extensively expanded and play important roles in thermal adaptation in oysters. We investigated expression of all heat-responsive hsps in two allopatric congeneric oyster species, Crassostrea gigas and C. angulata, which are respectively distributed along the northern and southern coasts of China, using common garden and reciprocal transplant experiments. Our results showed that hsps in C. gigas have evolved higher basal levels of expression under ambient conditions at each field site, with lower expression plasticity in response to heat stress in comparison to C. angulata, which exhibited lower baseline expression but higher expression plasticity. This pattern was fixed regardless of environmental disturbance, potentially implying genetic assimilation. Our findings indicate divergent adaptive strategies with underlying evolutionary trade-offs between genetic adaptation and plasticity at the molecular level in two oyster congeners in the face of rapid climate change.

生物对环境胁迫的响应是决定气候变化影响的关键因素。这些响应可通过基因表达的调控实现，涉及遗传适应与可塑性变化作为进化策略。热休克蛋白（hsp）基因家族在牡蛎中广泛扩增，对温度适应起着重要作用。我们通过同园种植与互移植实验，研究了分布于中国南北海岸的近缘种太平洋牡蛎（Crassostrea gigas）与葡萄牙牡蛎（C. angulata）中所有热响应hsp基因的表达特征。结果显示，与表现出较低基线表达但较高表达可塑性的葡萄牙牡蛎相比，太平洋牡蛎的hsp基因在各实验点常态环境下演化出更高的基础表达水平，而对热胁迫的表达可塑性较低。这种模式不受环境扰动影响而保持稳定，可能暗示了遗传同化现象。我们的研究揭示了两种近缘牡蛎在快速气候变化背景下，分子层面遗传适应与可塑性之间存在进化权衡的差异化适应策略。
