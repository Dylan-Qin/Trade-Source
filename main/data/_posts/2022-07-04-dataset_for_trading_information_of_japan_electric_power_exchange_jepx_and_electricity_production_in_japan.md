Spot Market Data:The spot price data of nine regions in Japan were obtained from the homepage of the JEPX. The dataset includes (i) transaction volume (100 GWh) and (ii) spot prices (Yen/kWh) in each area. Hourly price data were calculated as the hourly spot price by the mean of each two-time interval value in 1 hour, according to the 48 products traded in each 30-minute time interval within a day.Power Generation Data:The energy generation data in the electricity sector were acquired from nine traditional electric power companies (Hokkaido EPCO, Tohoku EPCO, Tokyo EPCO, Chubu EPCO, Hokuriku EPCO, Kansai EPCO, Chugoku EPCO, Shikoku EPCO, and Kyushu EPCO).The dataset contains various electricity power sources, such as nuclear, thermal, inflow-type hydroelectric, geothermal, biomass, solar, wind, pump-storage-type hydroelectric power, and regional power transmission by cross-regional interconnected lines. All the generation data were organized as hour-level data for each day.Utilization and Forecast Data:The utilization rate of the respective power generation facilities and the electricity demand forecast datasets were obtained from the Organization for Cross-regional Coordination of Transmission Operator, Japan.

现货市场数据：日本九个地区的现货价格数据来自JEPX官网。该数据集包含（i）各区域交易量（100吉瓦时）和（ii）现货价格（日元/千瓦时）。根据每日48个30分钟时段交易产品，每小时价格数据通过取两个相邻30分钟时段价格的平均值计算得出。. . 发电数据：电力部门发电量数据来自九家传统电力公司（北海道电力、东北电力、东京电力、中部电力、北陆电力、关西电力、中国电力、四国电力、九州电力）。数据集涵盖核电、火电、径流式水电、地热、生物质、太阳能、风电、抽水蓄能水电以及跨区域互联线路输送电力等多种电源类型。所有发电数据均按日整理为小时级数据。. . 利用率与预测数据：各发电设施利用率及电力需求预测数据集来自日本跨地区输电运营商协调组织。
