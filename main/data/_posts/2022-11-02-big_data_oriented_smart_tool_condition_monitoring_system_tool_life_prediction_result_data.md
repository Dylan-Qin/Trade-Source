c1_ wear.csv, c4_ Wear.csv and c6_ wear.csv are the open data set of tool wear experiment. The micro groove milling experiment was carried out on HSM600U high speed machining center. The tool used in the experiment is a vertical flat end milling cutter with a diameter of 800 microns. The cutting material is steel T4. Each cutting segment lasts for two seconds, and 100 cutting segments are conducted for each group of experiments. The cutting force signal is measured with a Kistler dynamometer, and the sampling frequency is 50KHz.Six different cutting conditions were used in the experiment. Experiments 1, 3 and 5 are used as training samples, and Experiments 2, 4 and 6 are used as test samples. After each milling, the tool wear data of each tooth is obtained by offline measurement. t_ tl_ 022619.fig and t_ RUL_ 022619.fig is the prediction result of the change of tool life and effective residual tool life with milling time respectively.

c1_wear.csv、c4_Wear.csv和c6_wear.csv是刀具磨损实验的开放数据集。微槽铣削实验在HSM600U高速加工中心进行，实验使用直径为800微米的立式平底铣刀，切削材料为T4钢。每次切削段持续两秒，每组实验进行100次切削段。切削力信号通过Kistler测力仪测量，采样频率为50KHz。实验采用六种不同切削条件，实验1、3、5作为训练样本，实验2、4、6作为测试样本。每次铣削后通过离线测量获取各齿刀具磨损数据。t_tl_022619.fig和t_RUL_022619.fig分别表示刀具寿命随铣削时间的变化及有效剩余刀具寿命的预测结果。
