To satisfy the increasing needs of nuclear data from diversified nuclear applications, the Neutron Activation Cross Section Data Library has been developed at China Nuclear Data Center (CNDC) in cooperation with China Nuclear Data Coordination Network. It contains calculated and evaluated cross sections of nuclear reactions for 818 stable and unstable target nuclei including isomeric targets nuclei from 1H to 257Fm are included in this library in neutron energy region of 10-5 eV-20 MeV. The ENDF/B-6 data format was adopted. The general information, comments (MF=1), reactions cross sections (MF=3), nucleus dictionary(MF=8) and split threshold reaction channels (MF=10) were included in the library. The reaction cross sections were obtained using UNF and FDRR model calculations or systematic analysis based on available experimental data.

为满足多样化核应用对核数据日益增长的需求，中国核数据中心（CNDC）与中国核数据协作网合作开发了中子活化截面数据库。该库收录了从1H到257Fm共818种稳定和不稳定靶核（包括同核异能态靶核）在10-5 eV-20 MeV中子能区的核反应计算与评价截面数据，采用ENDF/B-6数据格式。库中包含了基本信息、注释（MF=1）、反应截面（MF=3）、核素字典（MF=8）以及分裂阈反应道（MF=10）等内容。反应截面数据通过UNF和FDRR模型计算或基于现有实验数据的系统分析获得。
