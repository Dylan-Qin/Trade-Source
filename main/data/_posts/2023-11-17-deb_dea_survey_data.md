The software PSPP was utilized to clean the data as well as for correlational analysis. Missing data points within a variable were replaced with mean scores from that variable, n=88. Missing data points were replaced with the mean for that measure instead of using an invalid response, because there were not major outliers in the data set, which means that the mean is preserved, and the SDs will be reduced minimally (Lang & Little, 2018). Thus, with a very low number of missing data points being replaced by the mean, the SD should not be impacted significantly. All items were internally reliable.Given the multiple statistical comparisons utilized, a Bonferroni correction was used to prevent any Type 1 errors. Each test was designed to a p=.05 and a one-tailed t-test. The significant level following the correction was pnew=.016. For the power analysis conducted, a SD of 1.13 was identified. A power level of 90% with a 0.05 significance level was selected for this study. While the standard deviation was utilized from a set of community norms where n=243 from the existing literature (Fairburn & Beglin 1994). A sample size of 54 was identified where each group is n=27. The sample for this research project exceeds the identified sample size in the power analysis leading to statistically significant data.

使用PSPP软件进行数据清理及相关性分析。对于变量中的缺失数据点，采用该变量的平均值进行填补，样本量n=88。选择用测量项均值替代缺失值而非无效应答，是因为数据集中不存在显著异常值，这意味着均值得以保留，且标准差（SD）仅会最小程度降低（Lang & Little, 2018）。因此，在极少量缺失值被均值替代的情况下，标准差不会受到显著影响。所有项目均具有内部可靠性。. . 鉴于采用了多重统计比较，本研究使用Bonferroni校正以避免Ⅰ类错误。每项检验设定显著性水平p=0.05，并采用单尾t检验。校正后的显著性水平为pnew=0.016。在功效分析中，测得标准差为1.13。本研究选择90%的检验效能和0.05的显著性水平，其中标准差引用自现有文献中n=243的社区常模数据（Fairburn & Beglin 1994）。确定样本量为54，每组n=27。本研究的实际样本量超过功效分析所要求的样本量，从而获得统计学显著数据。
