In order to enhance the flexural performance of steel-concrete composite beams and alleviate the river sand depletion problem caused by the application of concrete structures, this paper proposes a novel steel-molybdenum tailings concrete composite beam.Subsequently, the monotonic loading test is performed on three 1:2 scale models of this composite beam to further analyze the failure process, failure mode, ultimate load bearing capacity, and deformation as well as the local strains at some typical measured points. The molybdenum tailing replacement rate is also under consideration. And finally, a series of numerical simulation analyses are conducted to examine the influence of beam section depth, steel plate thickness, and transverse reinforcement ratio on the ultimate load bearing capacity of the steel and concrete composite beam. Experimental results show that the novel steel-molybdenum tailings concrete composite flat beams with different molybdenum tailings concrete contents (0%, 50%, and 100%) exhibit similar mechanical properties, specifically manifested as: the load-deflection curves all contain four stages, namely, elasticity, cracking, yielding, and ultimate; the final failure modes of all specimens are similar, all being typical flexural failures; the section strains all conform to the plane-section assumption; the flexural bearing capacity and mid-span deflection of steel-concrete composite beams exhibit a linear decreasing and increasing trend with the increase of molybdenum tailings content, respectively, reaching the limit at 100% molybdenum tailings content, with the reduction of flexural bearing capacity and the increase of mid-span deflection by 9.03% and 16.39%, respectively. Finite element results show: The ultimate load bearing capacity varies noticeably with concrete beam section depth, steel plate thickness; whereas it has little relation with the transverse reinforcement ratio.

为提高钢-混凝土组合梁的受弯性能并缓解混凝土结构应用导致的河砂枯竭问题，本文提出一种新型钢-钼尾矿混凝土组合梁。随后对三个1:2缩尺模型开展单调加载试验，进一步分析其破坏过程、破坏形态、极限承载力、变形及典型测点局部应变，同时考虑钼尾矿替代率的影响。最后通过数值模拟分析梁截面高度、钢板厚度及横向配筋率对钢-混凝土组合梁极限承载力的影响。试验结果表明：不同钼尾矿混凝土掺量（0%、50%、100%）的新型钢-钼尾矿混凝土组合扁梁力学性能相近，具体表现为：荷载-挠度曲线均包含弹性、开裂、屈服和极限四个阶段；试件最终破坏形态相似，均为典型的弯曲破坏；截面应变均符合平截面假定；钢-混凝土组合梁抗弯承载力与跨中挠度随钼尾矿掺量增加分别呈线性降低和升高趋势，在钼尾矿掺量100%时达到极限，抗弯承载力降低9.03%，跨中挠度增加16.39%。有限元结果表明：极限承载力随混凝土梁截面高度、钢板厚度变化显著，与横向配筋率关联性较弱。
