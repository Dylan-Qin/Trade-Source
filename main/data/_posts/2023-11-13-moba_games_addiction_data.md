Two hundred and ninety-eight (298) samples were collected using a non-probabilistic sampling method. The criteria for inclusion were people willing to volunteer and LOL and Arena of Valor (AOV) MOBA gamers, which are the most popular MOBA games in China. Respondents also had to be between the ages of 12 and 40. According to 2017 data by the Nielsen Company, two-thirds of the U.S. population over 13 years old were game players. Sixty-two (62) of the gamers did not play MOBA games and were excluded from the experiment. Online questionnaires were randomly distributed through Wenjuanxing, which has similar functions to Amazon Mechanical Turk. The final analysis consisted of 236 valid questionnaires, representing a 79.2% response rate of the total samples. Acceptance to participate in the experiment acted as informed consent.

采用非概率抽样方法收集了298份样本。纳入标准为自愿参与的志愿者以及《英雄联盟》和《王者荣耀》玩家——这两款是中国最受欢迎的多人在线战术竞技游戏。受访者年龄需介于12至40岁之间。根据尼尔森公司2017年数据，美国13岁以上人口中有三分之二是游戏玩家。其中62名非多人在线战术竞技游戏玩家被排除在实验外。问卷通过功能类似亚马逊土耳其机器人的问卷星平台随机发放。最终分析包含236份有效问卷，占样本总量的79.2%回收率。参与者接受实验即视为知情同意。
