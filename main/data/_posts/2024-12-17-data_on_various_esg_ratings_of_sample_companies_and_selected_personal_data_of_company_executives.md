The initial sample of this study covers the A-share companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges during the period 2008-2020. We then screened and processed the initial sample data, including (a) Screening for companies with both RepRisk's ESG rating and Bloomberg's ESG rating. Specifically, the selection is based on samples with the same ISIN code and companies' English names in the Bloomberg and RepRisk lndex (RRI) databases. The ISIN code is a securities coding standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and is a unique code used to identify securities in each country or region around the world. We exclude samples that do not provide ISIN codes or have inconsistent English names. (b) We exclude observations with missing values for the main variables. (c) We exclude the ST, *ST and PT trading status samples during the observation period. Our final sample contains 1352 firm-year observations.The ESG disclosure score data and ESG performance score data required for the ESG-washing construction are respectively obtained from the Bloomberg database and the RepRisk Index (RRI) database of the Wharton Research Centre for Data Studies (WRDS). Positive media coverage data is sourced from the China Research Data Services Platform (CNRDS), while the instrumental variable (IV_population) is obtained from the EPS database and Juhe Data (https://www.gotohui.com/). Unless otherwise stated, all other data in this study are from the China Stock Market and Accounting Research (CSMAR) database. Data on executive company changes were collected manually by the authors back-to-back and independently. Then we compared and reconciled the data collected by each, and where there were discrepancies, we again collected and calibrated the data to maximize their reliability. We first obtained executive biographies from the CSMAR database, and the missing values were retrieved from Sina Finance ( https://finance.sina.com.cn/). Due to the unstructured nature of the resume data, we manually processed more than 30,000 resumes of executives to get the data of executives' company changes, based on which we calculated the per capita number of job hops of all executives in each company. The number of part-time jobs held by executives also reflects their pursuit of career changes and development, so in the robustness test the per capita mean of the number of part-time jobs held by executives is used as a proxy variable for careerist orientation. These data can be obtained directly from the CSMAR database.

本研究初始样本涵盖2008-2020年沪深两市A股上市公司。我们对初始样本数据进行筛选处理，具体包括：(a) 筛选同时具有RepRisk的ESG评级和彭博ESG评级的公司。具体地，根据彭博和RepRisk指数（RRI）数据库中ISIN代码和公司英文名称相同的样本进行选取。ISIN代码是国际标准化组织（ISO）制定的证券编码标准，是用于识别世界各国或地区证券的唯一代码。我们剔除了未提供ISIN代码或英文名称不一致的样本。(b) 剔除主要变量存在缺失值的观测值。(c) 剔除观测期内处于ST、*ST及PT交易状态的样本。最终获得1352个公司-年度观测值。构建ESG洗涤所需的ESG披露分数数据与ESG绩效分数数据分别来自彭博数据库和沃顿研究数据中心（WRDS）的RepRisk指数（RRI）数据库。正面媒体报道数据源自中国研究数据服务平台（CNRDS），工具变量（IV_population）来自EPS数据库和聚合数据（https://www.gotohui.com/）。若无特别说明，本研究其余数据均来自国泰安（CSMAR）数据库。高管公司变更数据由作者背对背手工收集完成。我们先各自独立收集数据，之后进行比对与核对，若存在差异则重新收集并校准数据以最大限度保证其可靠性。我们首先从CSMAR数据库获取高管个人简历，缺失值通过新浪财经（https://finance.sina.com.cn/）补充检索。由于简历数据为非结构化数据，我们手工处理了三万余条高管简历以获取高管公司变更数据，并据此计算每家公司的全部高管人均跳槽次数。高管兼职数量也反映了其对职业变更与发展的追求，因此在稳健性检验中采用高管人均兼职数量均值作为职业主义倾向的代理变量，该数据可直接从CSMAR数据库获取。
