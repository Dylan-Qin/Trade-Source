The dataset includes bacterial 16S and fungal ITS raw sequencing data. This study was design the effects of microbial diversity loss on soil C decomposition. There are five treatments including O, D0, D2, D4 and D8, each having four replicates.

数据集包含细菌16S和真菌ITS的原始测序数据。本研究旨在探讨微生物多样性丧失对土壤碳分解的影响。共设五种处理，分别为O、D0、D2、D4和D8，每种处理设四个重复。
