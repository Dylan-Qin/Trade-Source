Outliers are often present in large datasets of water quality monitoring time series data. A method of combining the sliding window technique with Dixon detection criterion for the automatic detection of outliers in time series data is limited by the empirical determination of sliding window sizes. The scientific determination of the optimal sliding window size is very meaningful research work. This paper presents a new Monte Carlo Search Method (MCSM) based on random sampling to optimize the size of the sliding window, which fully takes advantage of computers and statistics. The MCSM was applied in a case study to automatic monitoring data of water quality factors in order to test its validity and usefulness. The results of comparing the accuracy and efficiency of the MCSM show that the new method in this paper is scientific and effective. The experimental results show that, at different sample sizes, the average accuracy is between 58.70% and 75.75%, and the average computation time increase is between 17.09% and 45.53%. In the era of big data in environmental monitoring, the proposed new methods can meet the required accuracy of outlier detection and improve the efficiency of calculation.

水质监测时间序列大数据中常存在异常值。结合滑动窗口技术与Dixon检验准则的时间序列异常值自动检测方法受限于滑动窗口大小的经验性确定，科学确定最优滑动窗口尺寸是极具意义的研究工作。本文提出一种基于随机抽样的蒙特卡洛搜索新方法(MCSM)来优化滑动窗口尺寸，充分发挥计算机与统计学优势。为验证该方法的有效性和实用性，将MCSM应用于水质因子自动监测数据的案例研究。通过对比MCSM的准确率与效率结果表明，本文新方法具有科学性和有效性。实验结果显示在不同样本量下，平均准确率介于58.70%~75.75%之间，平均计算时间增幅介于17.09%~45.53%之间。在环境监测大数据时代，所提新方法既能满足异常值检测的精度要求，又可提升计算效率。
